+	Mar 1 2009 	Smart modern and new	This is another excellent, new facility in Beijing. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed with excellent facilities. The complimentary buffet breakfast was of a high-quality, with swift, low-key service. The hotel is within 10 minutes walk of most CBD buildings and the nearest subway station. While not as conveniently located as other hotels in the area business travellers should find its location acceptable. Tourists may find its location less ideal for their needs. Given that it offers nothing more than other hotels in the area, I'd chose it over others largely on the basis of price.	
-	-	Oct 1 2009 	Very good but hardly " Shangra-la"	I have stayed at other &quot; high-end&quot; hotels in Beijing -but this was my first experience with China World. It is a really nice hotel -but you better like &quot; Big-ness&quot; as it is really, really large. I was somewhat confused after arriving in my room as the hotel information made it clear the the hotel has its own water purification system -yet the person who checked me in and escorted me to my room made it clear to only drink bottled water ( which you really ought to make the practice anywhere in Beijing anyway)After a long flight ( 14 hrs) - I was ready to grab a bite and crash - so I went to the &quot;Cafe&quot; restaurant. Informal and adequate -but there were a bunch of little kids running around and playing at the buffet, picking up food, rolling on the floor - basically being unwatched &quot;kids &quot; - the restaurant staff gave them the evil eye but made no attempt to tell the parents who were seated at a large table in the corner - to go make them behave. It was really a pain and other partons were obviously upset. A five star hotel would have addressed the issue.The room was great -lots of international TV channels - staff very polite but it was a little surprising to find that some could not speak English - case &amp; point. One evening I wanted to go to the &quot;Gourmet Corner&quot; -a place advertised on their web site as well as the in-room info. This is a great place to grab a good sandwich and go back to your room. Problem was that in order to make myself clear ( the desk could not direct me to it &amp; even claimed there was no such place) - I went back to my room, got the hotel book, went back down had &quot;pointed&quot; to the information - then the light shown and a very polite staffer escorted me ( out the building, across the street and to the shop) - OK - no big deal - but 5 Stars -Really?I took my staff to the Arie restaurant one evening -really quite nice -good service and the food was really very good -but it was not truly outstanding - which is what I had hoped for. Price is really not too bad however -so as they say - you get what you pay for.Westerners should be especially cautious just outside the hotel. Almost every time I walked off-property - I would hear &quot; Excuse me sir - I am student -can you talk to me?' - Well DON'T -they're hookers...just ignore and keep walking. This is not the hotel's fault -just a note of caution. There is great shopping - an entire mall is down the escalator -Starbucks etc -good location and most helpful staff. I wouldn't give it 5 stars -4 or 4+ maybe.	
-	-	Sep 16 2005 	Not so much for the money	OK, it's a nice hotel. It has a nice exercise facility. It has internet that actually lets you do business (with a VPN), which I understand is rare in China. But the rooms are... merely adequate, and everything is outrageously expensive.Buffet breakfast for three? 50 dollars.Want a coke? 3 dollars.Airport pickup? 50 dollars. (Cab costs 15, found out later.)Ouch.Recommended for those on expense account.	
+	May 5 2007 	It's a showcase	We booked the hotel's spring package and stayed for two nights on April 21st 2007. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is in the Shuiguan valley, surrounded by beautiful hills and a view of the magnificent great wall. it is unfortunate that the service does not compliment the breath taking view.I took a nap on the day of arrival and woke up with a stiff neck and a headache. The pillow was too high for me. I called housekeeping and asked them if they have a different pillow. They said they did not. I thought I had better speak with the front desk instead, maybe they would be more creative. I was lucky to ran into the resident manager and told him my request. He told me that he would be able to arrange for a different pillow. I went back to my room that night, and the same pillow was on the bed. I talked to housekeeping again and they repeated that they could not offer any alternative. I slept on a rolled up bath towel that night. The next day we went to two of the bungalows that were open for public viewing. I saw the thinner pillow that I needed. I went to the front desk again and told them I found the alternative. The receptionist called the housekeeping department with much resentment and told them to change the pillow for me.We stayed in one of the rooms in Shared House 3. There were altogether 6 rooms in the house. All the guests shared the living room and the kitchen. The dirty dishes piled up in the sink for two days and no one took care of it. The overflow gabbage in the kitchen was cleared only on the day we left. We felt like we were college students staying in an expensive dormitory.The room that we stayed was very cramp. We could only watched TV on the bed. There was hardly any space for laggage. There was no place in the shower stall to keep our toiletries. We had to place them on the floor.Menu in the restuarant offers very limited choices and it is over priced. We feel the choices should be more &quot;international&quot;. To have three different types of eleborated Chinese cuisine and only one basic Western menu is really off. The choices at the buffet breakfast was only three star standard.All in all, We did not enjoy the accomodation and the food choices. We expected service of a 5 star hotel if not of the higher rank from Kempinski. In our opinion, service and pillow from the Sheraton chain is better then the Commune. We would go back to enjoy the beautiful view but we will not stay at the Commune again.	
+	Dec 26 2006 	Great hotel	This is a great hotel. Rooms are good size-seem recently updated-everything in good conditon and bed was great. Great selection of tv channels. Staff was very helpful- lobby was large and nice. Not crazy about rooms overlooking lobby but we looked out at the city. Great location. Lots of places to eat nearby and near vendors to bargain and get quick, cheap gifts.We booked a half day tour of the Great Wall through the hotel. This was fine- a half day is really all you need. Only complaint was our tourguide-he was not very good. Talked the whole time but never really explained anything. Unfortunately, I do not remember his name.	
-	+	Jun 17 2008 	Good location and nice clean hotel	This hotel is really quite nice and a great value. The rooms are better than I was expecting - not very large, but nicely done. Hotel staff is very friendly, but a bit busy and english is not that strong. Location is fantastic! You can walk to shopping (just to the west one block) and Tianamen Square etc. There is a great little dumpling store - go out to the main street and turn left. It's about 1/2 a block down the road on your left. Teh dumpling menu is all in chinese, but they are great and very cheap - just try your luck or the staff will help translate (sort of). Two things to watch for: 1 - the hotel will arrange tours for you, but they have a very restricted offering and they will not do anything beyond what they offer. For instance, they only go to two places on the great wall they would not arrange a car for the day unless we went to one of those. Later, we wanted to arrange a performance for some arcobatics, but when it became clear that we did not want to go to the their &quot;sponsored&quot; place, the staff person (Gary) refused to help us and became quite rude. So, if you want to do anything outside of their few selected (and more touristy / overrun) attractions, make your own arrangements before hand. 2 - a lot of taxi drivers do not know the location. So, print a map and make sure you know more or less where it is. This may improve over time as the hotel becomes more known. Overall, a great place considering the price and would stay there again anytime.	
-	+	Aug 29 2008 	Always impressive	The Grand Hyatt located on East Chang An Avenue. This is a good hotel, pricey but good. I have stayed here twice at different times of the year, and it was impressive on both occasions. The rooms are huge and scrupulously clean, and have absolutely everything you need.Dont even bring a toothbrush, they do the lot.I ate here three times each in different restauants in the hotel and all the food was good, nice bars, good coffee and a great staff. You can get access to one of the largest and most upmarket shopping malls directly from the hotel. If you wanted you might never need to go outside, which is a consideration given the pollution and frantic traffic that is Beijing.I mentioned that the hotel is pricey and it is a bit pricey but not ridiculously so, but boy you really do get your moneys worth.	
-	+	May 12 2007	Try This One	This wasn't our first choice of hotel but we were very pleased with it and would definitely return to it. It's location near the subway meant it was very easy to get to many parts of the city. Even though taxis are cheap we realised that the traffic is so bad that subways save a lot of time. With the new subways this should be even better. This is the best hotel of this class that we have stayed in. There was plenty of space and the shower and toilet were in good knick. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The minibar prices were the cheapest e.g. Y5 for a bottle of beer. There was usually at least one staffmember who could answer questions in english. No tips were expected.There were plenty of shops nearby and in the hutong next to the hotel was a fantastic range of little food shops, especially fruit. Very little english spoken but lots of freshly cooked food and very cheap prices. This is noisy part of town with Beijing railway station and a postal exchange but we weren't bothered by the noise.The only query would be how the aircon would cope with the heat of summer. We had some warm spring weather which overwhelmed the room's unit even though it was as low as it could go. Luckily it wasn't a problem for us.	
-	+	Jul 17 2009 	Unbelievable --- The best Hilton ever!	We stayed in the hotel in early July for 7 nights ... the first 3 nights I was there for business and they had all the facilities you're looking for. A great room of 60 sqm!, 24/7 Business Center, 24/7 Gym, seamless Internet in all areas, a grest lounge on the top floor, etc. Then my family joined for a long weekend and then the fun started, ... the most impressive pool for the kids I have ever seen, my wife got a great spa treatment and then our 2 kids even had a cooking class which apparently is happening every Saturday. I travel a lot and stay in many hotels around the world but I have to say, this property can match everyone and I cannot remember that I have ever stayed in a wonderful &amp; luxerious Hilton like this!	
-	+	Sep 24 2008	Yes it's as good as all the other reviewers here have reported!	Stayed for two nights - little to add to the glowing reviews from others.The hotel certainly deserves its high ranking and the room rate paid (CNY 1,094 per night for Executive floor room, including free use of the Executive lounge, breakfast, laundry, soft drinks from mini bar, internet access) was very reasonable.It is hard to find fault - but perhaps some of the food at breakfast was not of the highest quality (the cakes were stale, sushi dry and the fresh fruits not always ripe).As is too often the case in modern hotels, the shower drainage was blocked so that the water flooded into the bathroom every time the shower was used.Other than that, the hotel deserves its current top ranking on tripadvisor.	
-	-	Jul 1 2008 	Fading glory - skip the HI Central Plaza!!	HInn Central Plaza was so disappointing!!As mentioned in many other reviews, cabbies dont know of the whereabout of HI Zhong Huang (in Mandarin) nor whereabout of Caiyuen jia, the address in Chinese.The physical property still seems ok. Ooooh the TripAdvisor 2006 trophy takes pride of place in the lobby. BUT this hidden gem of 2006 is fast fading..Service from porter to check-in to housekeeping is sloppy. And I write factually without any secondary agenda ( in fact just sent a favorable review for their group hotel in Qingdao ).Evidents : inspite of after 3pm arrival, room was not ready. After check-in at 4pm into room 627, had to call housekeeping to re clean the toilet seat - bits of excrement from the previous occupier left uncleaned!!!!!!!! The &quot;water not for drinking&quot; sign was unglued n it was left dangling on the basin ledge thru all 4 days of my stay. The shampoo+amenities box pull-handle was missing and again nothing was done. Night lite didnt light up, neither did the desk lamp. Holder for shower head doesnt hold well anymore.No free internet connection, charged by the minute or abt US$15 a day.Bedroom slippers - the worse quality I had seen any of their group properties. The much raved concierge Storm - bumped into him once at the coffee shop - he gave me a map of Beijing. The receptionist had earlier said they dont hv any give away map. Coffee shop staff and cooks were somewhat a shade off. And oh the coffee shop closes at midnite; at half-past-ten was told the kitchen is almost closed - except for rice, all dishes on the menu were not available. Not even a pizza, muffin nor cake. No choice, other than a foot massage shop across the driveway, the entire neighborhood is dead quiet after 9pm.Forget about staying here! For location, there's nothing like choosing a hotel around Wangfujing or Chaoyang Sanlitun. For once I totally disagree with the high ranking racked up at TripAdvisor for the HInn Central, Beijing. There maybe a root cause for the 'i-cant-be-bothered' looks on the staff.	
-	+	Nov 19 2007 	Stylish Hotel Super Concierge	Having heard so much about Storm the &quot;super concierge&quot; I was expecting to meet a loud, boisterous, imposing man marching out to pump our hands and overwhelm us with ideas and suggestions. Instead, we were greeted upon arrival in the lobby by a rather unassuming, quiet, polite gentleman who was soft-spoken and gentle but who proved to be everything we were hoping for, and more. I had exchanged emails with Storm prior to our scheduled arrival, and he met us promptly as we got in from the airport, though it was getting to be late in the night. He had even called the airport earlier than morning to double check our arrival time. From then on, we were in his capable hands, and he certainly did not let us down. From dinners with his love wife Jasmine to a program of activities for each of the 4 days we were there (including sorting out transportation), Storm went above and beyond the call of duty - that's for sure. He listened to what we wanted and was proactive about making suggestions and arrangements. On our first day, he even accompanied us personally to Tiananmen Square via public bus, to give us a more &quot;authentic, local&quot; experience and to make sure we got there safely. Throughout, he was patient and kind and accommodating. We have never met a Concierge like him before. On finding out that I was pregnant, he even bought me a big bag of fresh, delicious walnuts (and cracked half of them for me during his personal time at home!!), as they are apparently &quot;good for the baby's hair&quot;. His level of service was absolutely touching. It may sound &quot;suffocating&quot; to some tourists, but for us he was perfect, and I believe he is sensitive enough to read people and decipher what level of attention they require. For our purposes, Storm fit the bill perfectly. In terms of the hotel, it was certainly more chic than what I would have expected of a Holiday Inn. Rooms/bathrooms were stylish, modern, and immaculate. Our king bed was HUGE and very comfy. One negative for me was the noise coming from the streets below at night, esp early in the morning. The room we were first given was Rm 906 and it faced the street so that by 6:30am, the sound of the engines from the cars was loud enough to wake and keep us up! To their credit, the staff was very nice about exchanging rooms for us immediately. While the new room was better (higher up and faced the other direction), I did think it was strange that I could STILL hear the cars early in the morning! Obviously the soundproofing around the windows could be improved upon and if there is one thing I would recommend to the hotel, this is it. Breakfast was pretty average. Stylish restaurant but the food was really rather bland and nothing to get too excited about. Not a problem though, because one would assume the exciting places to eat are OUTSIDE of the hotel in the real world. I would recommend the hotel (ask for an inward facing room if you're a sensitive sleeper like i am) and certainly for first timers to BJ would recommend that you contact Storm ahead of time, as he is by far the most dedicated and helpful Concierge we have ever encountered.	
-	+	Jan 14 2006	Great Hotel		
-	+	Feb 25 2009 	Stop your hotel research in Beijing : Go to Hotel G !	I stayed in Hotel G during my last business trip to Beijing. I was pleasantly surprised by the modern and trendy design of the rooms and the lobby. Location is perfect! Just 2 minutes away from Sanlitun and the main restaurants and night clubs in Chaoyang. Service is excellent, deserving its 5 stars, and staff is very friendly but what I preferred were the beds! The pillows and the soft mattress are just amazingEven better than sleeping in my own bed!!!!!Definitely go back on my next business trip and recommend it to my French colleagues!	
-	+	Dec 15 2008 	G Is for 'Gorgeous'	I live in Beijing, but I stayed at the Hotel G for a romantic weekend with my fiancee. The hotel staff prepared everything for us ahead of our visit so that there were rose petals at the entry to our room and a chilled bottle of Champagne waiting for us when we arrived.The service, attention to detail and character here are among Beijing's best. We stayed in one of the &quot;Greater&quot; rooms, where the furniture is elegant and sublimely comfortable and the bath fantastic. The bed with feather comforter and mattress cover was unparalleled, and though we didn't take advantage of this, the room had a full menu of pillow options.Hotel G is on a small street just off the main entertainment strip in Beijing, but the G's restaurants are also delectable for those who don't want to go out. 25 Degrees on the first floor serves Beijing's best burgers and hosts DJ parties in the late evenings on weekends as well.When my friends and family come to visit Beijing next time, there is little doubt that I will recommend that they stay here.	
+	Mar 6 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	The New Otani is a great hotel. It was very lovely and did live up to boasts on the various websites. It is a very modern hotel with very Euro/Modern furniture. The hotel room was roomy, very clean, the staff in the restaurant, business center, front desk and all throughout the hotel were very helpful. You can tell that the Chinese in this hotel have studied hospitality and demand that all of it's employees practice it. It was a in a great location in central Beijing, near restaurants and shopping. The ammenities that you would expect to find in a 5* hotel are all there, including sattelite TV, internet access, etc. There were a total of 6 of us who stayed in 3 rooms and we all were quite satisfied with the hotel.	
+	Apr 20 2007 	Recommended for family travel with young children	We just returned from China. Staying at HWA apartment made our Beijing trip easy and comfortable!The lobby is tiny but it does not matter to us. We booked business suite with two bedrooms (one king bed and one single bed) and two bathrooms, comfortable beds, clean and spacious room...etc.. (They probably just remodelled the room.) Sound insulation is good. The kitchen is equipped with micro wave, stove, fridge and oven but we rarely use it as KFC, pizza hut and MacDonald are near that made my kids happy!Free internet access is available in the room. The staffs were efficient when we needed their help to check the internet line. Also free city calls. Washing machine inside the bathrrom really helps for travellers with young children. No dryer but clothes dry completely over night.Location is convenient. Two department stores, supermarket and subway station are close to the hotel. There is only one stop to Tienanmen square. It is about 110 RMB by taking taxi to airport from the hotel.Breakfast is available from 7 to 10 am. The restaurant is clean, mainly Chinese breakfast with few western breakfast such as toast bread, bacon, eggs...etc. Food quality and taste are superior.Hotel staffs are nice and helpful. Since I speak Mandarin, I am not sure how helpful they are to help foreign guests.....There is only one minor thing that I think the hotel can do better. It has limited flexibility for late check-out. We've stayed 4 nights but the hotel policy can only grant for &quot;45 mins&quot; late.....However, I will definately stay at this hotel again based on the value, quality and location!	
-	Mar 23 2009 	Very "Lost in Translation"	A good quality if somewhat souless business hotel. Close to metro, offices and a shopping centre. Service is fairly efficient, breakfast good and varied. Bedroom/bathroom well appointed if lacking in charisma. Swimming pool and gym facilities were excellent.	
+	Nov 19 2008 	Overall Very Good	Very nice, boutique style hotel. Reserved in advance thru the hotel booking agent in the US. Since everything is negotiable, in China, the request we made was to have breakfast included in the price and to upgrade room if possible. The agent assured me she would take care of it. Check in was easy but they only set-up one breakfast in the cost and no mention in the agents notes about the possible upgrade.The person on the desk was very nice and arranged for 2 breakfasts and for 8,00 per night we upgraded to a Garden Room. The garden room was attached to a 10 x 15 foot beautiful garden with bamboo and table and chairs (well worth it). We looked at the suites and they were magnificent.The lobby and breakfast room was clean and well staffed. The food was plenty, Chinese and American style. Plenty of good choices, good coffee, etc.The location was a 5 minute walk to the Forbidden City. Not the greatest area but no problems, even at 3:00 AM.Close to the snack street and easy to get around with taxis - the metro stop wasn't close/The room was beautiful. The bathroom was all glass walls with a floor to ceiling pull curtain. Everything was clean and serviced daily. Plenty of storage in modern upstyle build-ins.The staff spoke very good English and helped with tours to the Great Wall and directions anywhere. Make sure you have the hotel card- taxi drivers did not speak English.Only bad taste was on check-ou they tried to charge us for 3 washcloths my wife used to take off her make-up. They said they could not get them cleaned but I refused to pay for them. They dropped it.Overall, good location, clean hotel, good staff, fair price. Paid 153.00 per night for Garden Room with 2 breakfasts (including all service fees)	
+	May 19 2008 	Excellent location - modern hotel	I can only subscribe to what the other travellers have said about the KAPOK. The location is great if you want to tackle all sightseeing spots in central Beijing, Forbidden City, Tienanmen etc. The Hotel rooms have nice and modern furnishing, bathrooms are striking. Downside is the WLAN connections not working and the PC available in each Room only being able to display Windows messages, boxes in Mandarin. The beds are hard....as others have mentioned which is the only downside.If you plan to leave for business trips to areas outside the first 2 rings in the early morning, expect heavy morning traffic and bear in mind that your taxi trip from the KAPOK may take quite a long time due. We ended up taking the METRO at WANFUJIN after havint been resufed by several taxis to take us to Ring 5 due to the congestions.	
+	Nov 13 2009 	Magic @ Michael's	Unfortunately only stayed one night,wished it could be longer. Everthing from internet booking to checking out was more than a positive experience.I am disabled and the staff went up &amp; beyond expectations to assist. The staff of wonderful young women did their tasks in such a positive manner---astonishing. Thanks again to all!!	
-	Jun 10 2006	Not terribly impressed	This hotel of the Nikko Hotel chain provides all amenities that you would expect of this group and class. However, the overall impression is a bit lower than other Nikko hotels in Asia. The rooms would greatly benefit from a renovation - or at least from a proper cleaning (cutains and floor). Internet connection (wireless) worked without problem and the staff was generally friendly and helpfu - although English skills are generally low. But after all it is China...Would recommend the hotel to anyone who is on business and needs to be at the nearby exhibition centre. Otherwise there are certainly nicer locations and hotels, particularly if on vacation.	
-	Apr 12 2007 	Good location but very old and dirty rooms	The Hotel is very well located and practically everything is accessible from there. We had problems when checking in, because theycouldn't find our reservation even with our receipt and Ref. Number..poor performance of the staff on this section. The first impressionat the lobby was great but not once we entered in our room which was old, dirty and with a terrible view of old houses's roofs. The bath was not enough clean, specially in the shower area.Heating was not working properly in the room, so it was cold. The person in charge of the Business Center, a chinese lady was very rude and lacking of customer focus. Her initial words were &quot;if you want to use Internet be aware the cost is 2 yuan ($0.25 ) per minute&quot;.The main Restaurant was good. Excellent buffets The main value of this hotel is just its location, but it doesn't have the quality service of the Novotel Hotal Chain. This is the first time we are highly dissapointed by a Novotel Hotel, and it was not cheap!

-	May 24 2005	Novotel not up to par!		
+	Mar 16 2007	Nice Hotel- Close to sights	My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights as first time visitors to tour China before heading on to Hong Kong to meet up with other adopting families. After a nonstop redeye flight from LAX we arrived in Beijing to a very quiet airport at 0530am. Grabbed a taxi with a non english speaking driver and off into the rain and fog we went! Now this driver since he didn't read or understand english took us to another Hotel popular with western tourists but it wasn't ours! after getting him straightened out by the management of the Hotel we arrived at the Prime blocks away. They immediately checked us in to a deluxe room that I booked thru Expedia without a problem. The Hotel lobby, restaurant, and rooms were elegant and nicely styled. Front desk staff speaks adequate english and housekeepers also enough to serve you. We had a pleasant experience and everyone was more than happy to take care of your needs. The hotel is located 3-4 blocks from a brand new indoor 4 story shopping mall located on a fashionable street. Cheap eateries located nearby too. Taxi's are cheap and ask Hotel to write directions in chinese for cab drivers	
+	Jan 23 2009	OK Location OK Hotel	Overall impression during our stay of this hotel was decent. It is a bit far from the city/main tourist areas, and cab drivers seem to have a hard time finding this place (even using the direction card from the hotel). It's about 35-45 minutes to the Forbidden Palace area. The hotel is not close to the metro, you will have to take a cab to get to the metro, about 10-15 minutes. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms, bathroom, furnitures were definitely on the US hotel scale. The lounge served breakfast, beverage, happy hour, and had 2 computers for guest use. The ladies that worked there were friendly, but generally left you alone unless you need their help (significant departure to our horrid experience at the prefer guest lounge in the Le Meridien Shanghai). There's peking duck restaurant down the street (walk out the hotel, to the left, down the street until the next main intersection), reasonable price, service, and good selection of dishes. We saw an episode of Anthony Bourdain in Beijing having dinner in a noodle shop, and always wanted to find that place (there are probably 2000 noodle shops in the city). Upon asking the hotel staff, they recommended Noodle Loft (exactly where Anthony filmed that segment)...excellent noodle.	
+	Jan 9 2008 	Wow!	I stayed at the Peninsula Beijing for 6 nights over Christmas with my father in 2 rooms. This hotel is fabulous and beautiful, truely 5 stars and very reasonably priced for the rooms and service. I booked a Rolls Royce for airport pickup which was a nice touch. They called ahead as we were nearing the hotel so when we arrived their was a team of people waiting on us to take our bags and escort us straight to our rooms for in-room check in! The easiest hotel check in I have ever had.The rooms were very nice and the location was good. Near the shopping street and also within walking distance of the forbidden city. The staff was always friendly and very helpful. Both hotel restaurants were excellent (but also overpriced compared to those outside the hotel) and the shopping mall in the hotel with every designer imaginable made it fun to window shop. On Christmas Eve they left a stocking in both our rooms with food goodies and a bear dressed up like santa, a very nice touch.I had an in room massage which wasn't very good at all but for less than $50 for 60 minutes I can't really complain. Also we booked a private tour around Beijing with a guide through the hotel which we were not happy with. However, when we informed the hotel they offered to give us another tour free of charge! We did not take them up on their offer but in my opinion the hotel tours were overpriced for what you get.Those are the only minor gripes I can come up with...my overall experience at the Peninsula Beijing was about as close to perfection as I have ever experienced!	
+	Nov 26 2007	Harold USA South Carolina 2nd Time Around	This is my second time around staying at the Peninsula Hotel in Beijing. The second time was better than the first which I though was impossible. I arrived on my Birthday October the 25th 2007. They knew that it was my Birthday and sent a wonderful Birthday cake to my room. They upgraded me to a Deluxe King Suite when I presented my Platinum American Express. The Entire Staff at the hotel are wonderful. I could go on for every concerning this Fine Hotel, but I want. You just need to experience it to believe it. Enough Said: Just Do It	
+	Jan 8 2007 	Great for business	Rooms were gorgeous, service was impeccable from both the general staff and the catering staff. If looking for a meeting venue, strongly consider the Peninsula Beijing. The main ballroom can fit up to 400 people. The breakout rooms are fantastic and the staff is very willing to help.Great place.	
+	Jun 8 2008	The service the rooms the location - fantastic	Thr Ritz Carlton Beijing at China Central Place is fantastic. Service was absolutely stellar. We live in Beijing and often go for weekends &quot;away&quot; in the city. This is now our favorite spot and highly recommend it for anyone who likes a luxury hotel with personalized service and a terrific location. Can't say enough great things about this Ritz.	
+	Mar 8 2008 	Great Accomodations and outstanding service	I went with my 2 kids for 4 nights in Feb. We stayed in the Executive Apartments and that was great for a family. It had bedroom living room and kitchen and I paid less 200CNY less than for a regular room. It is not centrally located, but there is a mall across the street with a grocery and everything you might need and taxis are cheap, besides the sights of Beijing are pretty spread out. You can't stay near the Forbidden City and still be near the Summer Palace or the Olympic Village. We had access to the club lounge with a great selection for breakfast buffet or we could have eaten in in our own kitchen. The hotel buffet restaurant was good, but they really had outstanding service. They worked with me on my pronunciation in Mandarin, since pronunciation in everything in being understood in Chinese. I think they were amused I was trying so hard to learn. They also went out of their way to help me, when I took money out of the hotel ATM and forgot to retrieve my card. They got a hold of the bank company and got them to retrieve my card and get it back to me even though the machine was not due to be serviced until later in the week.	
-	Oct 14 2007 	Out of the way but inexpensive	This is a very recent hotel that offers high quality ammenities and good staff but this hotel is far from the action. Definitely, it is the least interesting of the 10 or so hotels I tried in this city.Starting with the positive aspect, the rooms are spacious and well furnished. The hotel is out of the way from most interesting things (it is in the so-called financial district). While taxis are cheap, many drivers have not heard of the place and need to call the hotel for directions. It is also not fun being stuck in traffic most of the time.I found the staff polite and pleasant although they had this bad habit of barging into my room unannounced. I know I should use the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign more but they still should knock first or ring the doorbell.Also I find that the area lacks atmosphere. Unusual for Beijing, there is not a soul on the streets around there. The subway is a good 20 minute walk and there are not too many things around the hotel except some &quot;western&quot; restaurants. I was staying in the &quot;serviced apartment&quot; tower. Don't count on the kitchen to have any meals there. The drawers are empty. There is a kettle and some coffee and tea bags but no cup and no spoon!What I found most annoying however was the lousy internet connection. It is extremely slow and I continuously got disconnected. If you plan to do some work from your room as I did, you may decide to change hotel. This is what I had to do. Could not get anything done. Really really bad. Took me several attempts and over one hour to get this review in.The one saving grace is the price as I paid US$100 for a one bedroom apartment.	
+	Aug 20 2007 	Very good hotel	As the other reviews have noted, this hotel is not really close to any of the tourist sites, but as long as you have the name of the hotel written out in Chinese characters (something they are prepared for with many cards) it is not an issue. My wife and I stayed for three nights while visiting the city for fun. The concierge desk does share itself with the tourist desk and they are different, but not marked as such. One is trying to sell you packaged tours to make money, while the other can assist you in acquiring a much cheaper private car/taxi to see the same sites. The hotel has a clean spa with a sauna, steam room, hot tub and pool for all guests, which was quite refreshing after the long flight. The rooms were also decently sized and quite comfortable. The breakfast was quite good, with western and local selections. We enjoyed our stay.	
+	Sep 15 2007 	Excelente hotel		
+	Jul 4 2008 	Great Chicago hotel	We understand this hotel has undergone a recent refurbishment and it shows. Everywhere was clean, fresh and modern - the suite we stayed in was immaculate and we loved the revolving TV for viewing in bed or seating area. They have just opened a roof bar/terrace which is great for views over drinks.The location is perfect, however what makes the hotel great for us is the staff. Without exception they were all friendly and helpful without being insincere. A special mention to two people, the concierge Chris - who was a mine of information on where to eat and drink- and the doorman Victor whose warm personality and humour lifted the whole experience. They are both an absolute credit to the hotel and worth looking out for if you go.The only downside was that our suite was next to the lift/elevator which although not too intrusive was noticeable, especially a night ,and maybe some investment could be made in better soundproofing?It's our sixth visit to Chicago and this is easily the best experience we've had and was also good value.	
+	Dec 19 2007 	Loved the Affinia Chicago	Affinia Chicago is the best of the best. The rooms are in mint condition and the beds are awsome. The best selection of pillows that we have ever had at a hotel. The LCD television was awsome as you could watch it from any place in the room. The rooms are very large in size. We thought we had been upgraded, but they said that was the standard room.The employees are the most caring and wonderful people that I have ever met at a hotel. You are truly more than just a guest.Victor (doorman) is your friend from the minute he greets you while he is opening the door for you. What an awsome person. He really cares about each and every person and always remembers your name after first meeting you. You are truly a blessing for the hotel. Way to go Victor !!!Daniel and Pedro are also doorman always friendly and ready to tell you great places to go eat. Great job guys.Next is Milton the night manager. He wants to do all he can to make sure your stay is the best. He goes up and above the call of duty. He makes sure you have had a great day and if you didn't well he will make it better for you. He truly cares about each and every guest that enters the Affinia. You are a friend and not just another person. You are so awsome Milton. Kathleen the concierge is equally as good. The last minute we asked her if she could get us tickets to see Jersey Boys and she got them at an excellent price. Thanks !!!Now for general manager Tom Brady. He actually took time to introduce his self to us. Gave us a mini tour of what the new front lobby looks like. He runs one awsome hotel and it shows in the hotel and the staff.Yes there is some construction going on for the new facelift, but we never heard any noise. If you stay here you will not regret. This is a five star hotel and they have it down to perfection.Love the Affinia Chicago	
-	Oct 26 2007 	good room bad EVERYTHING else	We were encouraged to stay at the Affinia as part of a group in town for a Chicago wedding. We booked our rooms 6 months in advance, with the promise of a brand-new, full service hotel in a great locaiton in Chicago.The lobby was non-existant (under construction).The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful.The hallways and elevators are small, cramped and uncomfortable.The rooms are great - great beds, great television set.NO ROOM SERVICE - the kitchen is under construction.The bottom line is that during our stay, this was NOT a full-service hotel and should not have charged what they did. We were totally disappointed, hope it will improve, but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of Chicago's truly amazing hotels. It is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal.	
+	Sep 7 2009 	Wonderful Stay-Loved the Art Deco Feel	We took a romantic trip to Chicago for Labor day weekend. The Allerton was in the PERFECT location. We walked almost everywhere in the city. I could not recommend a more wonderfully situated hotel. The decor is splendid, it is art deco and very chic. I loved the lavender smell in the entry and lobby areas. Our room looked over MIchigan Ave. We stayed on the 6th floor. I believe the previous reviewer maybe a little misinformed because this floor was beautifully remodeled and it was only one floor higher than the 5th. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer in their negative rating of service as well. Anytime we requested a service or information it was prompt and the whole staff was very informative. The rooms are small, so I recommend upgrading to a larger room. I believe that their smallest rooms are called &quot;Petite&quot; so try to upgrade from that. They have blow dryers, high end shampoo and conditioner and body lotion. Also, you can dock your IPOD on the alarm clock.Beautiful decor, great service, and a perfect location..I highly recommend! We will be back.	
+	May 17 2008 	A good experience overa	Reading some of the reviews on here, I was nervous as to what we would find when we arrived in Chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised. I knew to expect small rooms and slow elevators, both of which were there, but neither were vacation ruiners. We were booked in a room with one double bed, though the bed was at least queen size. As for the small room, it was sufficient for the little time we were actually in there. The view wasn't much at all, but again not that big of a deal. The staff, which I'd read were rude and not helpful, seemed polite and more than willing to please. The elevators are slow and a little screwy, but we never waited more than a few minutes. If we had any complaints, the noise level from the hallway and other rooms could be high at times (the walls seem awfully thin), but for the most part it seemed like other guests were respectful in that regard. We'd stay here again the next time we're in Chicago!	
+	Jul 27 2007 	Style and Convenience	I stayed in this wonderful historic hotel whilst attending a conference there. The hotel is located very centrally, midway along the golden mile of shopping. The hotel is comfortable, the rooms a good size (for a hotel of this vintage) and the staff polite and helpful.My only gripe is that guests are expected to pay extra for wi-fi access in their rooms - surely a hotel of this standing shouldn't be doing this as the additional cost to the hotel is minimal!	
+	Jul 21 2008 	Amore! The Amalfi !	Our family of 4 travels quite a bit so we've had lots of hotel &quot;experiences&quot;. The Amalfi was one of our most pleasant stays. The staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel clean, and the afternoon happy hour was divine! Each staff person we encountered seemed to enjoy their work and performed in top form. I believe this also reflects on the management - happy work environments create happy workers! Cudos to the trustworthy housekeeping staff who returned my forgotten &quot;stuff&quot;. Some of these things were vacation purchases that still had tags on. They were returned in a timely manner intact. We will see you on our next visit to your beautiful city. The Blake Family from Winter Park, Florida	
+	Aug 9 2005	4.5 star hotel.....2 star price!	I stayed here the weekend of August 5th, for two nights. This was the first of what I am sure will be MANY visits to this wonderful hotel! My first impression upon entering the lobby, was WOW! They had a player piano that was playing music, and it gave the ambience of elegance and class to this hotel. As I soon discovered, this ambience does not end there! You do not check in at a traditional &quot;check-in desk&quot;. Instead, it is more like a concierege. I arrived rather early (12:30pm), and in most hotels they will not let you have a room until 3pm at the earliest. NOT HERE! After giving you your room keys, they ask if you will be needing dinner reservations or show tickets. They then offer the services of the bellman to deliver your bags to your room. I politely declined this, as I only had a small weekend bag with me. I entered the room and was instantly impressed! The room and bathroom were HUGE! There was an Amoir with a 27 inch widescreen television, a Dvd player, and a built in wet-bar! The king size bed with a pillow-top matress, and 500 thread count Egyptian Cotton linens, made me want to sleep all day! It was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in! The bathroom was HUGE! It had a beautiful black granite countertop, with a fogless, lighted makeup mirror, a tub/shower with dual shower heads, and the type of shower curtain that bows out, so it doesn't stick to you! And the maid comes back in the afternoon to offer turndown service, and to freshen up your room. Just another fine example of how immaculate the service is at this hotel! But it still does not end there. Every day between 5:30pm and 7:00pm, they have a complimentary Managers Reception in the lounge up on the 6th floor. In addition to free drinks, they have a wide array of complimentary finger foods: cold cuts, cheeses, breads, stuffed olives, olive oil, etc. This was one of the minor areas that can be improved upon, as the lounge is quite small, and only open for the duration of the reception. It would be nice if it were open later, even if they charged for drinks after 7pm. Most of us were just starting to enjoy ourselves, when we had to leave. And in the morning, they offer a very nice continental breakfast on every floor next to the elevators. They offer a wide variety of pastries, breads, fresh fruit, juices and coffee. It would also be nice if they also offered milk and cereal, but this too, is a very minor area which can be improved upon. The location is perfect as well. Directly across the street from Harry Carry's and the House Of Blues, and just a couple of blocks to Michigan Avenue. All in all I very much enjoyed my stay, and will DEFINATELY be back!	
+	Feb 5 2005	Great stay!	This hotel was wonderful! I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it!Pros:THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF!!! -Helpful: Knew great places to eat and HOW to get thereBreakfast: Pastries, coffee, tea, muffins, etc: FreshDrinks + hors d'oeuvres: Yummy!! Rooms -Clean -Well decoratedLots of people of different ages stayed thereCons:Very very very far from the museums	
-	Oct 21 2009 	You probably can find a better room with the same budget	The hotel lacks in the room maintenance. Cracks on tub, doors, and sink. The carpet had stains and holes. You pay the price for the history of the hotel, but you probably could get a nicer room for the same budget or even less.Service was fine but nothing special. Very noisy in the morning, could hear other guests in the hallway.Be aware that when you check-in, they hold $150 extra on the top of your nights of stay fees on your credit card, not very clear on the website.	
+	Nov 12 2009 	Sun Chips and Balloons	Landed in Chicago for the first time to see the Bears play. Ended up at the Avenue Hotel after some research. The hotel was right in the heart of where you want to be! Staff was very friendly and the E &amp; C downstairs is a great place to have a pint or start the morning off with a breakfast that you will not forget! Room was spacious and well appointed. Across the hall was a little noisy but that group was travelling to the Bears game also and with our door closed you couldn't hear the Canadians Snore. Although at some point we did hear the term &quot;Blue 42 Blue 42 Razor Razor&quot;! The beds were very comfortable with my roommate stating that he could spend all day just lying on it. All in all highly recommend the Avenue Hotel Chicago!	
+	Jun 24 2009 	Great People Great Service Great Location	We just spent a very enjoyable weekend at the Ave.Family and friends used the Ave as our &quot;home base&quot;, while attendinga family wedding. The hotel renovation is complete. From the front lobby to the sky lounge on top of the building, the Avenue is new, fresh, clean and very comfy! The staff continues a great reputation for outstanding guest service. Their genuine attention to the details makes every visithassle-free. The Ave is located in the heart of the Magnificent Mile within walking distance of fine restaurants and outstanding shopping. Great people, great service, great location, that's the Avenue Hotel!	
-	Apr 25 2007 	Pretty basic	Great location, but noisy inside and out since the train runs over the street one block away. The beds and linens need updating. If you want anything more than basic, try getting a special on a hotel downtown near Michigan Ave (magnificent mile). Sights like Millennium Park and the Art Institute are walkable from either location.Note: This area is made for walking, taxis are everywhere, shuttles go to/from the airports, and the train is easy to use, so skip the car!	
+	Oct 5 2006 	Great value great location!	We went for the Tut exhibit, so the location of this hotel couldn't have been better. The staff was helpful and friendly, and it's a great value, too. The continental breakfast was like feeding time at the zoo, but overall our stay was pleasant. Nothing to complain about here!	
+	Jul 26 2008 	Great Hotel but needed to improve on the pool	We had just returned from the Best Western River North Hotel and we liked it. A few things I liked is the room was nice and big and had a great bathroom (we stayed in a suite). I especially liked the all in one shower and the soap, shampoo, and body was all in one dispenser. One last thing is its in a great part very close to the museums there. Some things that needed improving is in the bathroom there was some chipped paint on the crown molding around the door. 2 more things that needed to improve was the pool, the pool was too small (probably because the pool was on the roof), one more thing is the elevator was too small and took too long to come. Overall I liked it.	
-	Feb 8 2007 	Cold rooms cold water	I was staying at the hotel for three nights and actually cut my trip short to two nights. The rooms did have nice beds but, thats about all.My room was very cold and the heat would not work. I turned the heat on at 5am and waited until 7am and my room was still cold. I called the front desk and they said they would have some one come up to the room. No one came to the room and i had to leave for a show.I got baack six hours later the room was still cold so I called back down to the front desk and was told that &quot;the building is old and when it gets cold and windy the top floor is hard to heat&quot;. I then asked for the desk manager who told me some one would be up, never happend.Not only was the room cold but the water for the bath was cold as well. I could not get hot water for the shower or the bath so, I had to heat up water with my in room coffe pot!	
+	Aug 31 2009 	Nice hotel for the price	We really liked staying in this hotel. It was very nicely taken care of and the decor was great! We easily walked to the Shedd from the hotel. We also walked down to Millenium Park with little effort. Beautiful view of Grant Park! The only thing that I have to say that's negative is it took FOREVER to get an elevator. We were waiting for a shuttle to take us to O'Hare and we left our room 15 minutes early in order to check out and get out front. After waiting for the elevator for 10 minutes, we ended up carrying our baggage down the stairs (we stayed on the 6th floor!). They only had 2 small elevators available to guests. Everything else was great though!	
-	Jul 18 2007 	What a dump!	I was chaperoning my Debate Team to a national competition. Our needs are few: space, quiet and comfort. The rooms were tiny, hot and not terribly clean. Service was slow. Check in is a nightmare because the check-in desk is located on a narrow strip--really just a wide hallway--opposite the elevators and on the main passage to the garage. Trying to fight your way through the mob to retrieve your car takes time. Just checking in takes time. The adjacent lobby is very small and, if there is a conference going on in the downstairs conference rooms, unavailable for regular guests. The only good thing about the hotel is that it runs a free shuttle service up and down Michigan Avenue. It's needed since the number of affordable restaurants in the immediate vicinity are limited. Not a good experience and I will not stay there again.	
-	Aug 17 2009 	Unorganized Staff Resulted in Security at Our Door	Because of a late flight home, we paid for an extended checkout, an additional 3 hours for $35, however this was not communicated to the cleaning staff who came by to clean our room around the normal checkout time. We explained that we paid for an extended checkout and went back to sleep. I don't know if the cleaning crew did not check with the front desk or exactly what happened, but an hour later security came to our room. We were charged for the extended checkout so it is unclear why or how there could have been a miscommunication, and given the interruptions it was not worth the money. Otherwise the hotel was fairly represented on their website other than that the rooms were smaller. The hotel also had convenient do-it-yourself water bottles on each floor - much better than paying the $4.99 you would be charged for a typical water bottle out of a hotel mini-bar.	
+	Apr 19 2007 	Location good hotel acceptable	Booked through Orbitz and $80 a night for a weekend we really couldn't complain. Hotel only a couple of block from the subway (blue line brings you straight from O'Hare for only a couple of dollars each). In the business district so a little quiet at the weekend and you will have to walk up town to find a more varied selection of bars/restaurants. Elephant &amp; Castle pub/restaurant attached to the hotel good for a drink if you like fake British pubs. Food not great and we found it rather smoky but it was an easy option.Our room was small by American standards but perfectly adequate for 2 of us (1xQueen bed). We were on the 6th floor facing Adams Street (I had asked for a high room having read previous comments about noise). I think the 8th floor is the highest. The hotel was really quiet and we had no-one next door to us. Whilst simple modern decor I thought the room (bathroom in particular) looked a little tired &amp; could do with a repaint. The bathroom was very small and we had a shower (no tub) - not a problem but to be aware of if you have children or are larger than average.Only 2 pillows on the bed and we wanted more. Room instructions said they were available in the &quot;Guest Amenities&quot; closets located on each floor. We had a look in the closet and found 2 pillows but neither had covers on and both were stained (nice!).Room would have benefited from a safe for guest use. Ours did not have one.Machines on each floor with empty plastic bottles and dispensing drinking water to fill them with was a nice touch.Staff all very friendly. We were there on a particularly cold April weekend and the concierges always opened and closed the doors behind us. Front desk staff always acknowledged us coming in and out. Felt reassured by requirement in elevator to use room key to operate it - a good security measure.Whilst not understanding the previous reviewers full situation I can't really comment but I was interested to note the observation that it took over an hour for the concierge to find the person a chair. There is a large guest lounge just off the lobby where we saw plenty of seats. Failing that there is a bar/restaurant off the lobby on the other side. Perhaps this was a different hotel?	
+	Jun 10 2009 	Great Hotel in a Great Location...Great Value too!	Just stayed at the Comfort Suites in Chicago, and I must say that I'm pleased with the hotel. We reserved a 2 queen beds bedroom suite and the accomodations were spacious, with ample closet space. The suite had a full kitchen, and comes with all the cookware, dishes, and silverware that you may need should you get the urge to cook. But why would you want to when you're staying in Chicago with all its great food? (The microwave did come in handy though when heating up leftovers for a midnight snack). The only negative was that the bathroom was really small, which was weird because the rest of the suite was large. The suite also comes with a washer and dryer, which is good in case you don't want to pack a lot of clothes and just want to travel with a carry-on (which is what my sister did). Everything in our room was new, the beds, the desk, the flatscreen TV, the rest of the furniture. We also got free internet, but you need to bring an ethernet cable because they don't provide Wi-Fi. The free breakfast was a nice extra. Everything was in good working order, and we didn't experience any problems in our suite. However, my parents were in another room and weren't so lucky...their air conditioner didn't work for 3 nights of our 5 night trip, which made their room an uncomfortable 75 degrees unless they opened the windows. The hotel did offer them a $25/night discount for the inconvenience, though I would have preferred they were given a room change or upgrade right away, instead of waiting a couple of days for maintenance to fix it.The location of the hotel is excellent, right on Michigan Avenue and right by the river. It's also convenient because a Walgreens is right at the corner, where we bought water and some snacks. Also, the bus stops were close by, either in front of the hotel, or around the corner, and we were able to go everywhere through public transportation. Public transit is cheap and very easy to use in Chicago, and you can buy 1, 3, or 7-day bus passes at the CVS pharmacy that is across the street, about a half-block away from the hotel.Also, the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful whenever we had any questions or asked for recommendations, especially Lee...he's awesome and a good resource for what to do in Chicago.The hotel is a great value too! We got a special grand opening rate through Travel Zoo, only $89 per night! Score! But the average nightly rate I've seen for the hotel now are very reasonable too.	
-	May 21 2007 	Worst Hotel Ever!	This was absolutely the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. As I walked into the hotel the cleaning crew was on strike. Not a good sign!! The hotel room was old, dirty, and it smelled. The A/C didn't work, the alarm clock was broken and only one lamp worked. Yes this is a cheap hotel and not a bad location but for only a couple of dollars more you can at least sleep at night.. I would run from this hotel not walk.	
-	May 22 2006	Better than all the hotels.....in Solamia	Ok, so that's probably an insult to Solamian Hotels...I am not picky, except when I pay $240 a night for a &quot;family suite&quot; and end up at a place so shabby that I'm wondering if rats or cockroaches might be a problem.This hotel is old and shabby. The current management is obviously milking all the cash out of it they can. Rooms were not just out dated, but in need of repair. Peeling wall paper, discolored ceiling tiles, nasty stained carpet, and every other type dis-repair you can think of.. If you can stay there for under $75.00 a night, you'll be happy and get what you paid for. Otherwise you will leave feeling a liitle &quot;abused&quot;. This is a hotel of last resort.	
+	Jun 23 2004	Charming and Classic	Despite the fact that there were rowdy (and rude!) ex-employees picketing out front while I was there (5/7-5/10), my experience with this hotel was one of the best I've ever had...and I travel quite a bit. The staff was so extremely accomodating and friendly---not that fake 'give me a tip' friendly, but genuinely caring; they joked with us on numerous occasions as well attending to our every need, regardless of how crazy we were (the hair dye we accidentally left on the first night's towels was kindly and gently waved off, and we were given nice bright white towels with a smile and assurances that it was no bother or problem). The building itself is an architectural gem. It shows its age, but gracefully so...like an old Hollywood starlet maintaining her beauty outside the limelight. Lots of great things to wander around and see inside the hotel, like the Al Capone suite and the pretty ballrooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors. I could easily imagine myself there decades earlier, enjoying the place in its splendor. The lobby itself is absolutely brilliant, and very comfortable to relax in.I will say, though, that if you're used to staying at posh hotels, or at least ones that are loaded with all the current and up-to-date amenities, you probably will be disappointed with the Congress. It doesn't seem like the kind of place you'd stay at for a business trip. But if you're like me and prefer visiting hotels that are more interesting, regardless of their modernity, this place is for you. The walls exude culture and history. Plus it's in a great location overlooking the park.And to add my comment on the whole 'bad rep' stuff being propogated by the picketers... I don't know what those peoples' gripes are in particular as that's their business, but as for the condition of the hotel--- NONE of the photos I saw that were being spread around by the picketers looked anything like what I saw in the Congress. My room had huge, lovely windows, a nice-sized bed that was clean and smelled fresh, and a sparkling bathroom that was well-stocked with nice soaps and shampoos. There was no yellow-colored water or stains on the ceilings or broken/dirty anything. The hotel shows its age, certainly, but it's more a historic monument than just a plain old place to lay your head. Don't be scared off by the propaganda those people are spreading. The Congress Plaza is a wonderful experience at a wonderful price. 	
+	Jun 1 2004	I think people exaggerate	OK, it's not the Hilton, but I have stayed at the Congress Plaza Hotel numerous times and have never encountered a bug, a broken elevator, or a shower or faucet that didn't work. The hotel is over 100 years old, and it does show its age. I have stayed in rooms that didn't smell great (but then no hotel room smells like your own home, especially when you're trying to sleep). I turn up the heat and crack the windows for ventilation. Bottom line, for the price and location, it's a pretty good deal, especially if you book through an online service (I use Expedia and have never had a problem). I will stay at the Congress Plaza next time I'm in Chicago.	
-	Jul 10 2006	Do Not Stay Here 	Well, this used to be a Le Meridian Hotel, and it has changed for the worse. We kept having to remind them we booked a package, because we were being over-charged separately for everything, when it should have been included. We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival, and did not. Two phone calls and three hours later, it finally showed up. We tried to have a drink in the bar, and even though we were the ONLY people there, three servers/bartenders came and went, talking to each other, not one of them acknowledging us. After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink. And don't bother to pay extra for &quot;City View&quot;; because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor, looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see.Oh yes, the valet lost his cell phone in someone's car, and called me at home today to see if we found it. He wanted me to call him back at home. Nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff, huh?For the money, stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same price-point and it will be much much better.	
-	Aug 31 2008 	N-O-I-S-Y All Night Long!!	Drunks. Horns. Ambulances. More ambulances. More drunks. More horns. Modified mufflers. More ambulances. Horns.11pm, 12am, 2am, 4am, 5am.Getting a picture? It wasn't pretty. This hotel is located directly across the street from a very popular-- for DECADES popular-- jazz club. And another night club. Did I mention there's a hospital somewhere nearby?When you check in at 3pm on a Saturday, you won't here a thing. But wait till 3am. You'll hear it ALL. As if your room has no windows. If sleeping is a crucial part of your hotel experience, you might want to consider staying elsewhere. Or making sure that your room is not on the south side of the building.This is a lovely hotel in every other way-- service, pool, beds, food, etc. BUT YOU CAN'T SLEEP ALL NIGHT.Maybe management should consider spending a little change on white noise machines. Seriously. At least acknowledge you have a major problem and give your guests the means to address it.If this hotel didn't have such a noise problem, I would rate it four stars at its price level. But, uh, I'd prefer a skanky bed and a quiet night for my nickel.Word to the wise.	
+	Jan 4 2006	I'll definitely be back!	My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for Christmas and New Year's. Over the course of the stay I stayed at 3 hotels in the city. The Courtyard was by far our favourite out of the group. We stayed only one night using my boyfriend's mom's points. We checked in around 2pm on the 28th and the room was ready for us. We stayed on the 20th floor. The room was a lot more spacious than I expected. The bed was nice and there was a little living room area with a couch and a coffee table. The bathroom was okay. The shower was fine but it took a while for the water to go down the drain. The sink and mirror area is a bit small as mentioned before (I have too many toiletries and make up!). There's free internet which is awesome. It's so hard to find free internet. There is also free internet in the 24 hour business centre. We didn't use it but that's what they said. There's a pool on the 10th floor but it's only open till 10pm so we missed it because we went out for dinner till late. The workout room which looks good is open 24 hours a day. There's a mini-Starbucks downstairs as well as a restaurant called Viand. Didn't eat there but would if we had more time. Menu looked pretty good and it looked like a cool space. There's a lot of stuff nearby with Michigain only a block away. I would definitely come back here again.	
-	Jul 6 2009 	Could've been great ... too bad it wasn't.	My wife, who just so happens to be named Dana, spent our first weekend alone since our first child was born eight weeks ago. I researched downtown Chicago hotels for weeks and finally decided on The Dana after reading so many wonderful reviews.I called the hotel about a week ahead of our arrival and asked them for three small requests.1. We wanted a king bed. This certainly didnt seem like much to ask. It was just my wife and I, so that makes plenty of sense anyway.2. We need a room with a refrigerator. Since my wife is breast feeding, she needed to keep the milk chilled for the weekend.3. If possible, an upper level room with a view.Upon arriving at the Dana, we were greeted very pleasantly by the door staff and escorted to the front desk on the second floor. After a very short wait, we were quickly given our room card and headed up to our room. The room was the complete opposite of what we requested: Two double beds, no refrigerator and a 12th floor view of the side of a building. I immediately went back down to the desk and let them know we needed a new room and their response was basically Were booked, too bad. When we explained we needed a refrigerator and we were already told by phone it wouldnt be a problem, their response was again Your room doesnt come with a refrigerator, too bad. Ive never experienced a front desk that was so unhelpful. It wasnt exactly the way I wanted to start our weekend.Fortunately, the check-in was the lowlight of the trip. Despite the fact my wife and I slept in separate beds, had to make God knows how many trips to the ice machine (which is hidden in a closet on the fifth floor) and gazed out of our window into an office building, I slowly warmed up to The Dana and eventually left the hotel with a feeling that I might, just maybe, stay there once again.POSITIVES1. Location. You cant beat staying right in the heart of downtown Chicago within walking distance of everything that makes this city so wonderful. Dining, shopping, beach, nightlife  You are right in the middle of all of it.2. Vertigo. The hotel has one of the best rooftop lounges in Chicago. It was packed both nights we were there and the views from 27 stories above were fantastic. The drinks were great. The staff was helpful. Good crowd. Great place.3. Shower. Its a one-of-a-kind with a rain head spout from the ceiling and glass on both sides separating the bedroom and the bathroom. Its about as nice of a hotel bathroom as youre going to find.4. Complimentary breakfast. It was so nice to be able to walk downstairs and sit down and be served a perfectly, light meal. They brought a really good fruit bowl with the choice of pastry and quality coffee and juices. It was very simple and very good.5. Door staff. The guys at the front door go out of their way to make you feel special. Any request was quickly answered and, unlike the front desk staff, they were very pleasant and genuine.NEGATIVES1. Front desk. Ive already covered it all with them. You would think a hotel would employ its most helpful workers for this position, not the opposite. The front desk staff was a joke. Completely clueless and just flat out insulting.2. Elevator. This might sound like Im being picky, but I cant tell you how many times I was in the elevator and another person was mumbling expletives as they battled with the elevator. In order to push the button of your floor, you have to very quickly insert your room card and then make your choice. This is much easier said than done because every single person on the elevator has to do it in order to select your floor. Its almost like trying to feed a crumbled dollar bill into a vending machine under pressure. Its incredibly annoying and if you dont do it quickly, you miss your floor and have to ride the elevator down to the lobby again. I appreciate the security, but I truly believe this is the hotels way of trying to be hip and in turn just pissing a lot of people off.3. Thin walls. I had the stereo playing at low volume and within minutes the hotel security was knocking. If you need to sleep, this isnt the hotel for you.4. Trying too hard. This hotel desperately wants to be young and hip. Its not young by any means and its not really all that hip. This place is loaded with middle-agers (40-50 crowd) and all of their attempts at being cool kind of fall short. Example: To get into the rooftop club, you have to briefly stand behind a velvet rope even if the damn place is empty. I could probably give you 10 examples of stuff like that. The ceilings in the room are unfinished cement. Trendy or an eye sore? I definitely thought the latter.5. Ice machine. Call and ask guest services where the ice machine is located. They will tell you its on the fifth floor. If you can find it in less than 10 minutes, Ill be impressed. There are a lot of things at this hotel where you just scratch your head and think, what the @#$% were they thinking?	
+	Jun 1 2009 	Good value not perfect	Started off my one-night stay on a very good note when I was given a free upgrade to a business-class room. The room was great, very clean, spacious, corner room with nice windows and a large bathroom with great light. Microwave, fridge, snack basket. The free wi-fi worked well but you can't get rid of the ask.com advertisement at the top, which causes some sites to malfunction. Bed was very comfortable, and little to no noise from inside the hotel; however, very late at night a group of raucous young adults (think &quot;inebriated fratboys&quot;) wandered past on the street and might have awakened me if I'd been asleep. The desk attendant apologized in the morning &amp; suggested that if street noise bothers me, I should ask for an interior room next time. It didn't bother me much but if you are very sensitive to outside noises, do ask for an interior room. The continental breakfast was nothing special - pastries, cereal, waffles, coffee - I usually try to go with fresh fruit rather than overloading on fattening pastries, but the fresh fruit selection was not great. All in all I found it a very nice place to stay, staff was very professional &amp; courteous, good location with a pharmacy &amp; several casual-dining restaurants within a couple of blocks. Great value for the price, I'd definitely stay there again.	
+	Oct 20 2009 	Great Location 	Stayed here for a weekend in August. I got a good deal through travelzoo.com. Check-in was pretty quick for a Friday (had to wait about 10 mintues) and they give you complimentray warm choholate chip cookies upon check-in. Our room and bathroom were clean. Staff we encountered were friendly. Parking is around $40 per day which sounds like a lot, but isn't bad for downtown Chicago. The location can't be beat. The hotel is only a few blocks from Michigan Ave in one direction and Lake Michigan/Navy Pier in the other. Would recommend to those looking for a nice hotel in a great location in Chicago.	
+	Jun 7 2008 	Very clean good location excellent service top health club ameneties	This hotel is putting the finishing touches on being remodeled, there's fresh paint and a place or two where they're doing some work. I didn't have any problem with noise at all, and it really is just a few places where you even notice they're finishing things up. The decor is updated and everything is new. That does mean, though, that they're not quite a Doubletree yet, so it's true, they don't have cookies yet, and I couldn't get our stay registered for points. These and the lack of free wi-fi are the only downsides of staying here.Its a quick walk to Michigan Ave, and very close to a grocery store and a couple of really nice places to have breakfast and coffee, beyond the bagel shop attached to the hotel. Great location. This time we didn't bring our car, instead we flew and rented a zip car, and the zip car is located near the hotel, too. More points for location!The rooms are nicely laid out, with plenty of seating, good for relaxing in the room. The decor is all updated and contemporary, and the bathroom is well-lit with attractive granite countertops. Great shower and lots of fluffy towels. I have to mention how great the service is. The blankets are down blankets, and when I told housekeeping that I preferred something other than down, they were fast and friendly about remaking the bed with fresh bedding. The housekeeper even came by to check in later and ask if the remade bedding looked alright.There's a great health club, with exercise machines and a terrific pool attached to his hotel, and a decent service center where you can use the internet if you'd rather not pay the $10 for internet access in your room. But you can also get free wi-fi all over the city, including at the contemporary museum of art, which is a 10 minute walk away. I booked the stay online at a decent discount, and if you can get your stay for a reasonable price, the location, cleanliness, updated contemporary style, nice health club amenities, really excellent service make this a good all-round hotel for visiting Chicago.	
+	Jun 19 2007 	Location Location Location	Good value hotel in an excellent location only a short walk from Michigan Avenue with many excellent bars and restaurants on your doorstep, as well as easy access to the FREE Navy Pier trolley and the Gangster tour only a couple of blocks away.The bedrooms themselves were clean and spacious and I have to say the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The only downside to the bedrooms I thought was not having free wireless internet which this day in age is usually pretty standard.I was very impressed with the evening free drinks reception and the breakfast was far better than expected with a good variety to suit all tastes.I will certainly be staying here again.	
+	Aug 16 2007 	Ideal hotel for us	We found this hotel to be in a good location - within easy walking distance of Navy Pier and Lake (not actually Lakefront though), river and Millenium Park and a longer walk to Sears Tower and museum area. We found the hotel to be quiet - no sound came from other rooms and we had no problems with noisy guests in corridors as often happens. We overlooked the road but did not find it too noisy. Love the Embassy Suites for their two rooms - as a family of four it's great to have the extra space. We stayed four nights (Sat/Sun/Mon/Tues) and unlike other reviewers, at no time did we have any queues for the free breakfast . Only problem was slowness of toasters. Didn't use the Manager's Reception but never saw any long lines for this either. Two sinks were seperate to shower which is always useful and there was a third kitchen-type sink between the two rooms along with a small fridge. Unlike other fridges on our holiday this one was completely silent. Everywhere was very clean. Loved this hotel and loved Chicago. Would definitely stay again although it's not cheap!	
+	Feb 26 2004	Great Chicago Embassy Suites!		
-	Aug 14 2008	Avoid if possible	I am a frequent business traveller and am surprised this hotel gets away with the Fairmont name. The Fairmont in Quebec, Bermuda, Boston and especially Seattle are all excellent hotels.I stayed here in the past (before the renovation) and had a poor experience (dirty room, poor service, noise, etc) but decided to try it again since I knew it was recently renovated. First of all, this is the first hotel I have ever experienced where the the lobby and rooms were better before the renovation.The former rooms were classic Fairmont with an old-world comfortable feel. I don't know how to describe what they are today. Just basic, bare, drab, uncomfortable, unattractive rooms with little color and cheap carpeting. Hotel also offers little insulation. I could hear everything being said in the room next door and the guests were talking in a normal tone. I reacall this happening last time I stayed here as well.The lobby is now nothing but a big lounge. When you walk into the lobby all you can see is the lounge. There are no meeting/seating areas if you were planning on having an informal meeting in the lobby. Very odd and not your typical Fairmont at all.. They just want you to sit in the lounge so they get your $$.No doorman greeted my cab when I arrived and the front desk clerk barely acknowledeged me and looked up from her computer when I checked in. And this was after a long line at check in. One person at front desk at 12:00 noon - peak check-in/check-out timeThink it is mostly a result of poor management.So many great hotels in Chicago. Avoid this one if you can.	
-	Jan 20 2007	Average experience	I stayed in a spacious room on the 38th floor with view on the lake. Interior decoration and bathroom were old fashioned and in need of touch up. I wanted to rest before a meeting in the early afternoon, but this was not possible because of renovation work noise coming from the upper floor. I complained and the answer was essentially that from 9 am to 5 pm renovation work noise is allowed. Room change was offered, but I did not consider it, because the next day I would have been out for work during that period. I do not think that giving me a room with renovation work noise and then offering a room change is a behaviour coherent with common hospitality principles.Stunning flower arrangements and abundance of staff are not sufficient to leave a good remembrance of a hotel.	
+	Oct 4 2007	Decent Hotel	This was a decent hotel for a one night stay to see the Oprah show. I love Hampton Inns but the $275 price for 4 adults in one room surprised me. Maybe this is a normal rate for Chicago but this was the most expensive Hampton Inn I've stayed at, and yet the most dated. The breakfast was good as usual and the hotel is well-located near the Mag Mile. The elevators are ridiculously slow! However, the room was reasonably clean and the staff very friendly. It seems like a lot of Oprah audience members stay at this hotel. The restaurant downstairs, Bollo, was excellent.	
+	Nov 17 2009 	Good Hotel Clean and quiet	I look for hotels that are cleand and quiet, and this one fits the bill. Roomsare well appointed, bed is comfortable. Somefood options about 3blocks up the street. Parking behind the hotel for $25 per day.I have stayed here before and will stay her again.	
+	Sep 19 2005	Beautiful historic hotel nice location	My husband and I stayed Sept 11-13. We were not part of the HUGE convention, we took a trip away w/o the kids. Got a great military rate for a nonsmoking King Jr Suite, rm 2263. The room was located at the end of the hallway of the middle tower facing Balbo Dr., we could see the lake and the fountain (and the tracks)Check-in: Quick, as it seems we got there before all the conventioneers, though they do offer several self-check-in kiosks, with a credit card. Bell-hops were ready and willing to help us with our 1 bag. I noticed they did not offer a wet bar key?hotel/Rooms: beautiful. hallways seemed a little dark, but it was part of the ambiance. Elevators were fine even thought the hotel was booked!!! There are 2 sets of elevators, upper and lower floors. Room was clean, nice and quiet. Small living room/bar area, perfect for our snacks ,water and sodas. I didn't check to see if the couch was a pull-out, if we came back out family of four (4 and 2 yr old) could stay in this type of room comfortably. HUGE TVs in both rooms. The pictures in the review before mine are very similar to the room we stayed in, though we had an extra/separate living room. Good water pressure and lots of hot water.Gym/Pool: There was a heat wave during our visit, so we welcomed the use of the indoor pool and spa on the 8th floor. We weren't charged the extra $, I think b/c I am a Hilton Honors member. We did not try the gym, but it looked to have several different machines in a nice bright setting. There was a deck where several people we laying out. I thought it was odd that they charged for water and lockers, when they already charge for the use of the health clubFood: did not try it, ice machines always full, even though hotel was packed.Staff: always nice and smiling. They did not openly greet us in the hallways but when greeted, they warmly responded. Concierge was helpful when I was trying to get directions.Since there was a big convention in town, it was difficult to find a decent room for under $200. I had reservation for W city center and this Hilton. I cancelled the W after a Chicagoan pleaded with me to stay at the hilton b/c of the beauty of the hotel and the location. We enjoyed it very much. It wasn't a &quot;heavenly bed&quot;, but a couple evenings without the kids made the stay romantic and heavenly. We were glad we chose this hotel and would stay again. Enjoy!Hope this helps with your decision.	
+	Oct 23 2009 	Convenient hotel at Chicago Airport	I've stayed at this hotel many times. Best feature is that it is attached to OHare airport so incredibly convenient when missed connection/unintended stay in Chicago or early morning flight. Like: nice fitness center, in-room coffee makers, quiet rooms, comfortable bed. Biggest complaint is lack of in-room safe. Room price varies significantly.	
+	Mar 19 2007	Great Hotel!	Stayed here for a night in order to catch a plane next day. Check in and everything was fine, the room was large and comfortable. Great Hotel! I always loved Hilton	
+	Jan 28 2008 	Great hotel - Great Location	My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in January 2008. The hotel was a in a great central location close to all of the local tranport. The hotel has recently been refurbished and the rooms are lovely and bright. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Chicago area.	
+	Feb 8 2006 	Great location; great staff; great price	Great price, consistently helpful, friendly staff, very clean and nice, small touches everwhere. I had a corner room w/ two windows, a microwave. refrigerator, easy chair and a very nice closet and bathroom for $130 night. Of course, it was February so I assume that price is seasonal. I would pay quite a bit more to stay there regardless. Near Nordstroms, a small grocery store &amp; other retail that comes in handy. Also free use of Crunch gym almost next door (as well as a nice hotel gym). The Weber Grill restaurant had a reasonably priced breakfast buffet with excellent service and nice &quot;to go&quot; options. A very well run hotel. I wish there were more like it. Will definitely stay there again.	
+	Nov 4 2004	Would definitely stay here again	We stayed here for 3 nights in july. The room was very clean, spacious and had an amazing view. The staff were friendly and very helpful, we were shown to our room by a member of staff to check that we thought there was enough room for the rollaway beds that we required. There was plenty of room for the rollaway beds and they were brought up straight away. There was free internet access, a small pool, hot pool and small gym all of which we made good use of. The hotel is in a great location right outside of the El. We would definitely stay here again.	
+	Oct 19 2009	Fabulous view - overall good hotel experience	Stayed 4 nights in this hotel on 18th floor (Thurs-Sun), connected by pedway to Merchandise Mart. Also CTA train station located in the mart. Long walk from hotel but still good. Please note, all closed on Sunday, must enter from outside and down the street. Good mid city location. Registration staff we encountered not especially helpful or friendly but concierge Christopher AND Robert were exceptional. Was not given the $20 complimentary voucher from breakfast for each day as was stated in my Expedia purchase info. Hotel staff totally refused to honor my request, even though I paid a LOT for this room and they admitted they had such an offer. View was fabulous. Room clean. Heating/air worked great. Minimal noise could be heard from rooms around us but the cleaning staff VERY loud outside our room for an extended period as they prepared each morning to clean rooms. Bathroom did not have heat lamp or fan. No counter/mirror area outside of bathroom so very difficult for two or more people to get ready at the same time.	
+	Aug 28 2005	Holiday Inn Chicago Merchandise Mart	This was a nice but not high on amenities. Where else could I get a 3 Star hotel with a room facing the Chicago River with Elevated service right outside my door for $85.00 a night. I used Priceline and let them pick the hotel. Everyone was extremely friendly and the location was excellent. This Hotel was only five blocks from Harry Carry's and the House of Blues. Try it you'll like it.	
+	Oct 31 2004	Excellent! I Highly Recommend!		
+	Sep 12 2004	Chicago on a Budget	We took Amtrak to Chicago and this hotel was in walking distance from Union Station. We also chose this hotel because it was near the blue line stop on the &quot;L&quot; subway train. The Holiday Inn room was purchased for $117 on the Holiday Inn web site. This was a Friday and Saturday night stay in July. We felt safe at this hotel and the Clinton stop of the blue line train was at the corner of their parking lot. The room was nice and clean and we had no complaints. They have a roof top pool, but it was too cold that weekend to swim. We arived a couple of hours before check in and they held our bags in secure room. There is not much around this area, but we were hardly in the room for anything but sleep. Chicago is a fun city so there is not much reason to stay in the hotel for the entire week or weekend. Last time we were in Chicago, we stayed downtown but it always seamed like we were walking 5 blocks to get to the subway. With this hotel, the subway stop was right by the hotel.Most of the places we visited was on the red line, and you do have to do a free transfer and walk a block through a tunnel to get to the red line train.We would stay here again because of the convenience of the subway and its price.Also, buy a 3 or 4 day subway pass.Jeff	
+	Nov 17 2009 	Superb location everything's included staff was awesome.	I met my girlfriends in Chicago for the weekend for a birthday celebration and stayed at Homewood Suites. I wasn't sure what to expect, but we loved it. The rooms are huge, with a full kitchen, a pullout sofa and a monster king sized bed. Bathrooms are large enough for 3 women to get ready to go out at night without stepping on each other. The staff was great. We dined at Table 52, Art Smith's (Oprah's former chef) restaurant and stopped at Le Colonial one night and walked there easily. The first night we were a bit tired, so simply walked across the street to PF Chang's - who also provides the room service at the hotel. The entrance to Nordstrom is just across the street from the hotel's front door and for discount shopping, walking to the loop to shop on State Street is an easy morning jaunt over the river. All in all, a good price for a nice hotel with a charming staff and a magnificent location. Internet and breakfast are included in the room rate. I'll definitely come back and bring the kids next time...loads of families were staying there that weekend.	
+	Aug 22 2009 	Good place in dowtown Chicago	The place is in a great location very close to Mag Mile. The rooms are decent, although the bathroom could use some updating. The suites are spacious and clean. The elevator is annoyingly slow but you have to take the good with the bad. The breakfast each morning had a good selection even though it gets pretty crowded. I would stay here again.	
+	Sep 3 2007 	really good	we stayed at homewood in late august for a week and were really pleased that we chose to stay here! The suites are really well sized, with a big bedroom, large seating area with a huge TV and a good size kitchen with everything that you may need, plus the views (we stayed at the front of the hotel, opposite Nordstrom) were fantastic!!! Breakfast is really good, lots of choice, and the welcome home dinner (FREE!) is really good quality stuff (we had philly steak, burgers, mac cheese, saussage and chips, plus snacks and pudding!) and will definately save you money. The location couldn't be better, round the corner from pleanty of eateries, one block from the mag mile, one block from the red line (grand), and within very easy walking distance of the river and then the loop. The top floor pool and small work out room are also good, and seemed not be used that much. The hotel seemed to be busy during the week, but quiter and full of families at the weekend.	
+	Nov 15 2009 	NIce stay at the Hotel Allegro	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro over a long weekend a couple weeks back and thought overall that the hotel was very nice and worthy of its class and the reviews we had seen. We booked through PL and although the Allegro was not our first choice, we were very pleased.The hotel is right next to the Palace Theater and Chicago City Hall and has a number of services nearby and is just a short walk from State Street. It was very conveniently accessed from both the Kennedy Expressway and the L, which was two blocks away at Clark/Lake. Self-parking is about $35 a day in the ramps nearby ($49 valet), but you can save yourself a few bucks parking at Grant Park ($29) and walking the six blocks.The lobby and registration are upstairs one floor from the street, with plenty of valet and bell help at street level. Once checked in, we headed up to our room on the 8th floor, only to find out it was a double. After deciding against being Ozzie &amp; Harriet for the weekend, we went back down and were quickly changed to a king without any fuss.As other posts have mentioned, the rooms are a bit on the small side and a little more like what you might find in Europe. We thought our room was clean and that good use was made of what space was available so that we didn't feel cramped. We had two small closets to hang clothes and a three-drawer dresser. The bed was also very comfortable. Our room was on the northwestern corner of the building, which sits at the corner of Wells and Randolph. The western leg of the Loop L runs on Wells, but we really didn't have too much trouble with noise from that or the street below. My only possible complaint with the room was with the mini-bar refrigerator, which cycled almost constantly, after which there was a audible &quot;pop&quot; of the condenser.We didn't avail ourselves of any of the hotel amenities during this stay. The hotel bar looked like what you'd expect from a hotel bar, while the restaurant looked like it might possibly attract a non-hotel guest clientele.Overall, we were please with our stay and would stay at the Hotel Allegro again.	
+	Feb 28 2009 	Great location Great Hotel Great Wine Great Fitness center Tiny room	This is best hotel bargin in Chicago if you are not overly unhappy with a small room. Great hotel just redone by Kimpton. This is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of escape and fun to all of their hotels. This is a location just off of LaSalle and next to the Cadillac theater. It has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing Italian meal. The wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants. The Kimptons have a social hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels. You sit in a designer, kind of London circa 1968 couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests. They are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it. The exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well. There are two other Kimptons here but for the money the Allegro is the best value and location. Always consider Kimptons as they never disappoint where ever we have used them.	
+	Oct 8 2006 	My fears were unfounded	After reading some horrible reviews of the Allegro, I was a bit skeptical about staying there, however, I thoroughly enjoyed our 3 day stay. Because it is an older hotel, there are the occasional strange noises when the toilet flushes and when turning on the water in the shower (don't turn the hot water on too fast....the pipes make a loud noise!!), but, other than that, the retro-style of the room and the brightly painted walls made for a pleasant change of pace from standard hotel rooms. Our room was not as small as I thought they would be and had no problem with the smaller bathroom. The room was clean, bed comfortable and, because our room faced the street, no noises from the train. I did enjoy the &quot;world&quot; music that was played in the elevator and hallways. It was always invigorating!! The 5:00 wine/piano reception is a fun way to meet other guests and find out about other interesting things to do in Chicago. Although I am not a big fan of wine, the hotel does not break out their vintage wine for this reception. It tasted like it was lower end, but, the experience was still enjoyable.If you will be visiting Chicago for a few days and will be utilizing the train for transportation, I recommend buying the visitors pass for, I believe, $20 for 3 days. It saves the time and hassle of having to purchase a pass each time you use the train.Because the Allegro is in the theater and financial district, this may not be the place to stay if you want to go on a mad 3 day shopping spree as it is quite a distance from the good shopping unless you want to take the train. On a positive note, the Allegro is only about 1 block from the train, so, it has a very good location in that respect.All in all, it was a pleasant experience and I would return.	
+	Sep 19 2009 	Mostly a very positive exerience.	Stayed at the Blake with my wife while I was in town for business. It was a &quot;mostly&quot; very positive experience. The desk staff and the night door attendant were extremely helpful and polite. The room was slightly small. However, all the furnishings were up to date. The only negative was the day/morning door attendant got a little snippy with my wife when we asked him if he would store our bags for a few hours. Besides that, it was mostly a positive experience. You will not be disappointed if you stay at the Blake.	
+	Oct 8 2009 	The best post-vacation vacation!	Kimpton offered me a great deal for being a Kimpton Intouch member, so I couldn't resist the offer of staying in the historic Burnham Reliance building in the El section of Chicago. The location is prime. Walking distance to the Art Institute, two blocks away from Millennium Park, one block away from the Cultural Center. And the shopping, watch out! You're right around the corner from Nordstrom Rack, kitty corner from Macy's (Marshall Field), and across from Old Navy. From my window, I could see the Chicago Theater sign. After roaming around Eastern Europe for three weeks, I wanted to keep this trip low-keyed and slower-paced. Because of the location, I did not have to rush around and was able to do a couple of things a day at a leisurely pace and still make the wine reception at 5 p.m. The bed was comfortable and everything was spic and span. The staff was kind and helpful, and the lobby felt like my living room after a couple of days.	
+	Oct 1 2009 	Hotel Burnham is a special place	This month marked my 4th stay at Hotel Burnham which has given me ample opportunity to make a fair assessment. The unpretentious staff has been consistently courteous, eager to please, and seem to genuinely want guests to feel welcomed. The hotel is centrally located in The Loop with Millennium Park and the Art Institute a short walk away.The physicality of the hotel stands out: it is stunningly gorgeous and its meticulous renovation (it is a historical site formerly known as the Reliance Building) shines. Elegant, exposed wrought iron stairs, marble wainscotting, and period light fixtures all add to its understated elegance. The standard electronic room keys were replaced by keys on brass rings. The rooms are attractive and spotless (many have chaise lounges in the bay window), cozy but not cramped, and are equipped with stereos, and, by request, a goldfish for the lonely traveler. The curtains are elegant, sporting excerpts from Mozart scores.Newspapers appear at your door, gratis, free morning coffee is available in the lobby, and there is a daily complimentary wine hour which features quality wines. Wake-up calls are performed by the staff rather than the electronic way, adding a human touch. The staff will also print your boarding pass!While the hotel is a quiet one (I am sensitive to noise), I would recommend requesting a room on a higher floor (above 7) that faces Washington Street since State Street often has street performing drummers.While I tend to dine outside of hotels, I found the Atwood Cafe in the lobby to be excellent with a creative menu.My four stays at Hotel Burnham have been consistently outstanding.	
+	Aug 12 2008 	Great hotel in a great location	The only thing stopping the Hotel Burnham from getting a perfect 5-star score was the poor internet service I experienced while I was there. Everything else was top-notch. The staff greeted me with a warm hello whenever I walked in and told me to &quot;enjoy your evening&quot; when I walked out.I ordered room service one night while I was there and they sent up a complimentary dessert! Granted it was a chocolate mousse-type dessert, so it was probably due to them having a few extra and the dessert generally not storing well. But it was a nice gesture at any rate. And it was a tasty treat!As for the photos people have attached on this site, they do not do the Burnham justice at all. It is a very nice place! Marble everywhere, very clean, great restaurant, good water pressure /hot water...like I said, everything was great. And the location is just about as good as you could ask for.As for the internet...I connected via broadband plug the first night to what is listed as &quot;complimentary internet&quot; and was promptly charged a $10 access fee to my room. This charge terminated my internet the next evening and did something to my laptop so that it would no longer connect to the internet at all. I called their tech support line (which is not in the city) and they spent a great deal of time trying to get it working again. It started working (ie, connected to Google) and they hung up.. I attempted to go to hotmail and it cut out and would not connect again...I called tech support and the next guy told me just to &quot;wait and try again in 45 minutes or so&quot; . I even attempted to use the wireless in the lobby but my laptop wouldnt' connect to their service at all (I have never had any wireless problem EVER). I assume that since they charge a $10 fee per night for internet access (although it is supposed to be complimentary) if you don't pay for ALL your nights at the same time, the system somehow excludes you from using the internet again...a poorly designed glitch. I stayed at the Hotel Burnham for 4 days and had usable internet only on the first evening.	
+	Nov 21 2007 	Great Boutique Hotel	We stayed at the Burnham for 7 nights early in November and despite the night time construction, we loved the place. On the 9th floor the jack hammering was audible, but not especially annoying. They clean up before the morning rush hour, it's really quite amazing, but maybe that's just the architect in me speaking. In any case, the service was excellent, the location cannot be beat and the room was adequate. It's a very historic building. Read the history on the boards in the elevator lobby. I was there for a huge conference and I am very glad I blew off the package deals and opted for this hotel. (at nearly the same rates as the deals)I am only giving it 4 dots because I feel that a courtesy warning about the construction was warranted. I would have still stayed there, but knowing would have prepared us.	
-	May 29 2007 	Okay Stay	Our stay at the Hotel Burnham was just average. A little dissapointing for a 4 star hotel! Their Standard rooms have a queen bed where as most hotels have 2 singles for their Standard. While this was fine for my husband and I, our 2 friends that vacationed with us were not happy to have to share a bed! Construction across the street gave a horrible view. (Not the fault of the hotel) Service was average. Nothing beyond our expectations. Stayed at the Swisotel same time last year. Would much rather stay there then here!	
+	Feb 22 2009 	A 5 Star Value at 5 Star Location.	My review is consistent with others. This is very European style of hotel. Located in a older building, small lobby with rooms that are very clean, neat but small. This is not a Hilton or Sheraton but you are not $300/night either. We stayed over the Valentine Weekend for less than $100/night including breakfast. Breakfast is average but more than adequate. The staff is very friendly. And security is good. Your room card is required to operate the elevator and the front door late at night. Two blocks west of Michigan Ave and four blocks south of Water Tower, handy Trader Vic around the corner, two blocks to the Red Line. Could not be more convenient.	
+	Jun 14 2005	Very Budget Very Clean	We had been trying since January to find a reasonably priced hotel for our trip to Chicago in late May. Everything within reason was well over $200 for a convenient location. Since we don't have much room for compromise in the cleanliness category, we were reluctant to take a chance with a more economical two star hotel. After doing lots of research, we decided to take a chance on the Cass Hotel located two blocks off of North Michigan Avenue. Upon entering the lobby, we were really concerned about we had gotten ourselves into. There is absolutely no ambiance, few ammenities, and a very sparce feeling. Our room was pretty much the same and without any view. HOWEVER !!! it was as clean as a whistle. The room itself was fairly roomy, adequate bathroom, not one single odd aroma, freshly laundered bedspreads. The best part of our decision to stay here was that the location relative to what we had planned to do could not have been any better. If you're looking for a hotel with more than bare bones economy, don't waste your time. If you want a clean, convenient place to shower and sleep, this just might fit your needs.	
+	Feb 25 2005	Nice little place	The place might look a little shabby from outside, but it really has a great offer at a very convenient price, in an amazing location, a 10 minute walk from michigan av. and 3 minutes from the nearest CTA station. There's nothing &quot;hip&quot; in this hotel, everything is very simple and basic. But everything works perfectly. The staff is friendly and well disposed.The rooms are not big or luxurious, but are well equipped (with a big refrigerator and kitchenette), clean and confortable. They offered *free* wi-fi connection in the lobby. The cafeteria is a bit poor on the &quot;looks side&quot;, but it offers a nice breakfast, cooked at the moment, for a very nice price (way less then your average starbucks).Two thumbs up for cass hotel!Marcello	
+	Jun 28 2009 	Wonderful stay!	Stayed at Hotel Monaco 6/24-6/26 and really enjoyed my stay there. Hotel staff was friendly. Stayed at room 912 which was a King river view room. Absolutely loved the bed and the window seat. So comfortable I took a nap on the window seat. Loved the turn down service to the Hotel lobby to the free wi-fi. The only thing from my experience there that I didn't like was the walls from the hall way to the room apparently are too thin or something. There was a loud guy in the hall way talking on his cell around 930pm on 6/24 on the 9th floor. Was about to say something to the front desk when I heard someone from the other room confronted him. He continued to be loud for a few moments then he left. This really didn't have anything to do with the hotel but just made my experience there was slightly diminished because of that. Anyway. The room was beautiful and clean and would love to stay here again.	
+	Jun 9 2008 	Very posh for one night business trip	I went on a 1-night business trip to Chicago and my hotel was booked for me. I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel. Once checked in, I was given a king size room on the 12th floor. The view is awesome and I loved the 42&quot; plasma flat screen tv. The bathroom had plenty of towels and tolietries for one night. There was a small mini fridge and liquors on the dresser- nice touch but pricey- $4 for an oj! Our group met back down at the Crimson Lounge. I liked the music/ atmosphere, but a lady came around wanting us to purchase the table for the night. Umm... they were not that busy or that good. The bar was just as good. The hotel is in an area with lots of night life and is a quick taxi ride to anywhere in the downtown area. House of Blues was next door and we didn't have to pay a cover since we checked it out near closing time, awesome blues. I had a newspaper at my door early the next morning (before 8am). Check-out was a breeze and a billowy white curtains in the entrance was a nice touch.	
+	Oct 11 2006 	good price lovely room would recommend	We stopped at this hotel on the 17th and 18th of September, we'd never been to chicago so wanted a hotel fairly central, its over looks the river and is a 5-10 minute walk to the magnificent mile. The room was large and clean and the decor as described on the hotel web site. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. When looking for a hotel we didn't want to pay a fortune but wanted a 3* or above hotel, we found that hotels in Chicago tended to be on the expensive side compared to other cities (Las vegas, New York, San fransisco).We paid £125 a night taking into account the other hotels we looked at we feel we had value for money and would recommend this hotel to others.	
-	Jul 29 2009 	Large Convention Hotel in Need of Upgrade	The Hyatt Regency is a large, convention style hotel, that is located just off of Michigan Avenue in the midst of downtown Chicago.The hotel is huge and there a multiple towers within the hotel complex. The first floor of the hotel has an open, casual restaurant and some sitting areas while the lobby is on the second floor. A bar called Big is on the second floor and had a neat vibe.The room was decent. The bathroom was not grand or large but efficient. The bed was comfortable and was in the middle of the room with a large desk area behind it. The TV is HD. Large windows showed a nice view of the lake from my room. There was slight problem with the air conditioning and it did not keep the room cool enough most of the stay. The staff was great all around. Did not eat at the restaurants as there are amazing choices in downtown Chicago (a great meal at Shaws Crab House).The workout facility was efficient and the machines seemed to be fairly new and in working order.Overall, the hotel is getting old and is need of some upgrading. There are some better choices in the area (like the Fairmont around the corner) but if you can get a good price (we paid an average of about $150 per night) or have a convention in the hotel, it is fine.	
-	Jul 20 2009 	Absolutely Horrible	This place is busy and chaotic. After a lengthy check-in ordeal, we waited in line 10 minutes to ride the elevator to the 11th floor. We opened the door to find that the room was already occupied. We went back downstairs for another lengthy ordeal and then had to wait another 10 minutes to take the elevator to our new (unoccupied) room. The air conditioning did not work. The one vent just blows air up towards the ceiling near the window. It was very hot and humid in the room. Maintenance came and said it was fixed, but it was not. The ironing board was broken. Parking costs $48 per day. The only redeeming quality of this beastly place is the location.	
-	Aug 9 2009 	Solid hotel but the location was not to my liking	This is a pretty decent hotel, but I prefer to be a little more north. Most of the better destinations in Chicago are a few miles north of this McCormick Place location. This hotel has an excellent location to Soldier Field, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, and the Field Museum .. so that was a positive. They offer shuttle service to various spots, so the location might not be much of a problem for everybody. All told though it was a great bargain for me as I was able to secure a room for $77 per night thru Priceline, but in the future I will look to stay a little north of this location.I had a nice stay though, and I would recommend this hotel ... especially to those that plan on hitting the destinations I mentioned earlier, and for those that have business dealings in or around McCormick Place.	
-	May 3 2006	Not equipped to serve everyone	To begin with, do not confuse this with The Days Inn at Lincoln Park in Chicago. This confusion is probably why I had such a bad experinece. I have stayed at the Days Inn there and been quite happy. We paid $200 apiece for a 2double rooms. So for three evenings the bill was close to $2000 with tax. There was no bell service. My companion had just finished a long bout with cancer and was unable to carry her own bags and I arrived later. No one available until I got there. We are two middle -aged women.The heat in both rooms (the other was my brother and his wife) was unbearable for days and when we finally were able to speak to someone after 2 day (language was sometimes a difficulty) we we told that it was because both rooms were located above or below the boiler rooms. (It was obvious that they had known this was a problem, before . There was a Cubs game that weekend. The solution in the freezing weather (after 2 days) was to put in air conditioners in both rooms. We became more comfortable after that but for 2 evenings my traveling companion got very little sleep and the same was true with the other room's occupants. I eventually took something to do so. The other room was occupied by my brother and his wife , who were told free internet was offered. It was not free. I told the desk attendant that one could go next door to Starbucks and do it for free and he replied that this was the only Starbucks in the country where this could be done. I felt as if I were a tourist in a country where they believed we had no idea how things run. I would never have written this if they had offered any discount whatsoever but we paid full price and i have stayed in many hotels in Chicago. We paid more than others were paying because we spoke to them. We chose the hotel for it's location near where we needed to be and know that in Chicago , it is well located. Terrible disapppointment.	
+	Jul 28 2003	great service		
+	Jul 28 2009 	Amazing Location	This hotel is somewhat the half way point on Michigan Ave - its walking distance (10-20 mins) to all major sites. We loved the location and would stay there again in a heart beat. There is a cool Wine/Chocolate Bar restaurant in the hotel.Metro: On the way there we took the metro from the airport - from the airport we switched at jackson and got on the red line and got off at Grand (red). It was a few blocks from the hotel. On the way back to the airport we walked 15 minutes from the hotel to Clark and Lake and get on the blue a direct line to the airpot.The room was clean, decorated nicely - but not every big. If you are more than 2 sharing the room it may be a bit crammed. The pool was nice but indoors - we check it out and lots of families were using it. There was an amazing coffee shop Lavazza Coffee Cafe, one block away at 162 E Ohio St. Every morning we started our routine with a nice coffee / espresso from there. It was wonderful!	
+	Aug 22 2008 	Great Intercontinental Hotel in the heart of Chicago	My first contact with the Intercontinental was a shock: USD 50 per day of parking! Must be the fact the hotel is located on Michigan Avenue. I then checked in and got my usual upgrade (I am Intercontinental Ambassador for more than 10 years). They gave me the suite No 4000. To get there, a first lift took me to the 38th floor, then another small one to the 40th. It opens directly on the room's door as it is located in the penthouse. As a result, I had a 360 degrees view. Quite a treat! I then decided to have a swim in the 80 years old pool, where Johnny Weissmuller was preparing his Olympic Gold medals races. Then there is an historical tour within the hotel to be sure not to miss anything spectacular. And of course a Intercontinental level of services at all stages and a fully fledged rooms with the delicate amenities one can expect from a *****. In short, a great ***** hotel, extremely well located, carrying a lot of history where to stay for business or for pleasure. P.S.: Make sure you book a room in the historical building!	
+	Jun 9 2006 	James Hotel is Tops		
+	Jul 8 2009 	a lovely hotel on the city's north side	We had a wonderful weekend here. This is a quiet relaxing boutique hotel in a nice residential neighborhood on Chicago's north side. If you want glamour &amp; glitz, a pool/sauna, or have the desire to see &amp; be seen, then you should stay at one of the high-rise hotels on the Magnificent Mile. But, if you want a very nice, comfortable, pretty, good quality small European style hotel, then this is a lovely place. I used to live in Chicago and love this north side neighborhood - stroll around the neighborhood and find great local restaurants, coffeehouses, bars, boutiques. Close to Wrigley Field. Easy access to stroll through Lincoln Park. Walk just one block east and it's easy to hail a cab. The closest El stop is about a 10-min walk. (For Shabbat observers it is within walking distance to at least 2 shuls.)I definitely recommend paying a little extra to get one of the suites - this will give you a bigger room, a sun porch with additional seating area, and a little fridge &amp; microwave. It's a small increase in price compared to a regular room and a big difference in what you get. Very comfortable bed (wonderful soft comforter) and nice bathroom. Nice staff. I will definitely stay here on my next visit to Chicago.	
-	Jun 26 2008 	Mediocre Marriott	This hotel is in a great location in downtown Chicago. The room is really nothing special. The bathroom is extremely tiny. The beds are very comfortable and four pillows per bed. Cleanliness is good. The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. They don't have a traditional front desk but &quot;pods&quot; and the agent will step out in front of the pod and ask if they can help you and then escort you to their pod. Quite friendly service. The breakfast buffet was quite good and the Executive Chef took my order for an omelette. Breakfast food was very good. The biggest complaint I have is the room doesn't have a mini-bar and the AC seems to be strained to keep the room cool. The shower was a delight.	
-	Apr 29 2005 	Okay hotel great location	Room was small and overcrowded with large furniture. Bathroom was TINY. Room temperature could not be regulated. Not enough outlets to plug-in electrical gadgets. Staff were friendly. Room was clean. Great location. If you are driving or taking a taxi, the entrance is actually on N Rush St, not Michigan Ave. I would check around and choose another hotel in the future. If you are planning a small conference, the fifth floor does include a conference facilty worth considering.	
+	Jul 22 2005	Good Hotel Good location Good Service	This hotel was clean, comfortable and well staffed, and I had no problems at all. If I have to make a flight out of O'hare, I will be staying here again. And the $9/day parking beats the $13/day at O'Hare any day!	
+	Jul 1 2009 	Our stay at the Knickerbocker made our first trip to Chicago a memorable experience!	Prior to our visit in Chicago, I did not know anything about the city. I frequently use TripAdvisor.com to research and plan my trips, and this is how I found out about the Millenium Knickerbocker. We stayed for 4 nights, which reduced the price per night due to an online hotel promotion. We are normally budget hotel frequenters (i.e. Hampton Inn). I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.1. Accomodations: we booked a superior king (which is a corner room). When asked to upgrade to a room with a view, they gave us a street view of East Walton Street (where the hotel front faces). Although disappointed at first, we loved the room. There's enough space for two people and we experienced no outdoor noise from the street. It is a small one-way street so there's not a lot of thru-traffic. The bed is very comfy, the modern decor is funky and the bathroom is cool with the big shower stall and rainfall shower-head. It felt like I was in a spa bathroom.2. Service: everybody was extremely helpful. I read a Frommer's Chicago city guide book cover to cover before arriving, but we also relied heavily on the concierge staff for many suggestions. Les and his staff were fabulous! They are so knowledgeable about the city - all the restaurants suggested were excellent and their sight-seeing tips were so helpful. Tjhey secured us reservations for places that weren't in my little guide book and we loved them! If you don't know Chicago, use their hotel concierge service for suggestions.3. Location: the hotel is located on the northern end of Michigan Avenue, but it seemed so close to everything. On a nice day, you can walk the Miracle Mile down to Grant Park or the Chicago River in 20 minutes. You are near so many restaurants and shopping, all within walking distance. The Hancock Observatory is 1 block away (all the locals said to go there instead of the Sears Tower). We did not rent a car (the price is high for parking at the hotel or basically any hotel) and just cabbed or walked everywhere - so worth it.4. Drawbacks: their restaurant menu (and room service) are a bit pricey for me. The food was good but I would prefer going someplace nearby for breakfast instead of dining in.You will always read good and bad reviews based on personal experience, but ours was nothing but excellent. I recommend staying here and will stay here again on our next visit to Chicago.	
-	Apr 9 2005 	Millenium Knickerbocker - wouldn't stay here again	I stayed here one night for a conference that was overbooked and bumped to another hotel because this hotel double booked. While the staff was very friendly and attentive, this was a major inconvenience. The lobby is beautiful but you're overcome by noise and smoke from the lobby bar as you enter the hotel. Yuck! The rooms look gorgeous on the website but this is very deceiving. The bathrooms are the tiniest I've ever been in...towels are horrid, no ventilation, wallpaper discolored and peeling off the walls and a tub that will only accomodate a midget. The walls are paper thin- you can just about hear everything in the other rooms. The location is good- one block from Michigan Ave. I was glad to leave and won't be back.	
+	Aug 14 2004	Aug. 5th checked out Aug 8th Extremely Pleased!	I must admit I was skeptical after reading reviews on the internet. At that time the hotel was undergoing mass renovation and people were complaining about bad plumbing, noise, etc. One comment was, Do Not get a room by the elevator. Paper thin walls. We had a room by the elevator, not noisy at all! Yeah! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms (we rented 2) were sooooo pretty and comfy. Small bathrooms but very clean and well staffed every single day! The consair's went way beyond the call of duty to make our stay interesting. Even took us into the Crystal Room that had been booked for a wedding to show us it's magnificence. We were sooo impressed. Some of our best pictures of the Hotel are of this room. Showed our girls the secret passage way used by gangsters in days gone by. They loved that!	
-	May 13 2006	Low budget and convenient	My friend and I decided to stay here for one night to attend a concert at the Congress Theatre ($48/nite). The neighborhood is kind of rundown until you turn the corner and there are these lush, posh areas. The location was convenient, access to the busline and within 15 min walking distance to where we wanted to go. There were restaurants nearby, but we did not choose to eat anywhere nearby. Safety at night may be an issue.The onsite people were very nice and hospitable. The room we stayed in was tiny, but sufficient for our needs. Bathroom had baby cockroaches (didn't bother us as long as long as they weren't bothering us). We brought our own sheets and blankets (which I think should be a must if you or your traveling buddy is a neat, sanitation freak). Rooms were equipped with a fridge and tv. Noise from the outside is loudly audible. While I slept through the night after the concert, my friend could not deal with the upstairs neighbors yelling out the window from 3-4 AM, the screeching cars, the police sirens, and the ongoing car alarms. I vaguely remember it, thinking it was part of my dream. There is metered parking in front of the hotel and after 6pm there is free parking around the corner.Overall, ok experience, but probably wouldn't stay there again unless it was very necessary.	
+	Jul 22 2003	Can't beat the price	Straight out of the 70's. Nothing fancy, nothing extra. It was clean and we didn't see any bugs or prostitues. For the location and price, it can't be beat. :)	
+	Nov 23 2008 	posizione eccezionale		
+	Apr 2 2009 	A really nice hotel	We stayed for 5 days, having booked through Expedia, and managed to find a good deal. Overall, I thought this was a thoroughly nice hotel, with some of the nicest staff I have ever encountered throughout all my travels! Everyone was delightful and eager to help. We particularly liked the staff in the reception area who were happy to help us with all our enquiries and bookings. Checking in and out was rapid, and our room was spotless and well equipped with a lovely, comfortable bed. I had signed up for the Select Guest system on booking, but unfortunately, it hadn't registered with the booking. I had, therefore, requested a high floor, in a quiet room away from lifts. We were given a room on a low floor, directly overlooking building works and next to the lift. The drilling started at 8am! I requested a move and we were allocated another room on the same floor - the noise was better but still audible at the low level, but I assume the hotel was busy. I would think that the noise would be a problem for most guests and it is such a shame. We had breakfast once in the dining room and it was very pleasant but incredibly expensive. Drinks in the bar were a similar mortgage, but with a really nice view. The swimming pool was pleasant and clean, if a little soulless. We didn't use the gym but it looked fine. There are restaurants very near. It was our first visit to Giordano's - if you are novices too, only order a small stuffed crust pizza for two - I wanted more but nearly expired when I saw it!! We went to see a Bull's game which was amazing, went on an Architectural boat tour, booked at the hotel which we really enjoyed, and had cocktails in the Signature Bar of the Hancock Tower - a wonderful experience and well worth the cost. Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and would go again when the building work next door is complete (but they are just laying foundations...). The hotel's huge strength is its staff - nothing was too much trouble and I was enormously touched and impressed with each of them - we're not used to people caring in England so much. Thank you for having us.	
-	Jun 25 2008 	Confirm email access before booking room	Our company had 6 rooms for 5 nights. They had no internet access at all. When the guys approached the front desk they were told they would restart the server. This happened for 2 days and did not correct the problem. I called the front desk and spoke to the manager Tatiana, she was extremely rude and even laughed when I told her that NONE of the guys could access the internet. FINALLY the GM Larry Knottingham called me and was very polite and helpful however assured me the problem had been corrected and the guys still cannot access the internet. 2 of our guys had to have their cards reactived as they would not work. WILL NOT BE STAYING THERE FOR OUR NEXT MEETING.	
+	May 13 2008 	You will be so SPOILED after this experience!	I cannot find any negative or inadequate thing about this hotel. I am always travelling on business, and never have I stayed at a property that exceeded my expectation at all levels as this place did. From the moment you walk in you get special personalized service from the staff. The lobby is spectacular (check out the art collection as it is pretty amazing), the checkin painless. The rooms are to die for. They are bright, clean, stylish and very functional. The bed and pillows were so amazing I wanted to sleep more than ever. The Eames chair, the huge tub and the fixtures are out of a decor magazine. The bathroom opens up into the room and you can enjoy a bath while watching TV or looking out the window! They give complementary shoe shines and pressing nightly. The staff know exactly how to give a combination of superb service and give you personal space. Nomi, the restaurant is amazing (esp. breakfast!) and has a gorgeous view of Michigan Ave. And the location can't be beat - right in the heart of the most gorgeous area of Chicago...shop 'till you drop!	
+	Jan 23 2008 	Very nice stay	My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance Chicago in Nov. for 5 nights. The hotel was clean, had nice sized rooms, coffee makers, and the normal amenities that you would expect in an American hotel. We did not try the restaurant, but there was a Starbucks in the lobby that was very convenient. If you walk out the back door of the hotel you are right on a major shopping street with Macys, and a number of others storesit was a nice surprise as I was more focused on Michigan Ave. and did not even realize this when I booked the hotel. A short walk away is a nice little bakery and sandwich shop called Corner Bakery, my friends and I enjoyed eating there a couple of times. The best part about Chicago though is Michigan Ave. The hotel is at the base of this long wonderful street, if you make it to the other end and cant make it backcall for a taxi, they are every where! Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes. It was very nice, the staff was helpful and they were very courteous and efficient.	
+	May 11 2005 	Upgraded to top floor suite- quite happy	I'm platinum with Marriott (75 nights or more per year) and the front desk upgraded me to top floor suite. Everything was perfect. Gigantic marble bathroom- separate tub and shower. Very classy, no complaints. I travel a lot for business and would always prefer to sleep in my own bed no matter what the hotel. However, if you have to travel on business, this is the hotel and the room to be in.	
+	Oct 20 2003	Renaissance is of class		
+	Nov 9 2005	Great Hotel perfect location	Just got back from a four-day visit to Chicago and loved the hotel we stayed at. The customer service was excellent, the beds were comfortable with many pillows, the rooms were nicely furnished, modern and they had a great desk/work area and roll out sofa. The staff was friendly, the El/Subway was within walking distance as well as restaurants like Bennigans for a late drink/burger. In addition, the shuttle from the airport was easy and quick. Only negatives. Parking was $15 per night and you could hear some traffic/planes in peak periods, but overall a great experience and we would stay there again on our next visit.	
+	Jun 22 2009 	Perfect location great staff. Very high cost and overcrowded elevator	Great Miracle Mile location. Quiet side street right off the best part of Michigan Ave. close to shopping and night spots.Staff goes over and beyond. Nice complementary breakfast. Free Internet (but wireless was down the whole week I was there - only wired worked).Downside is a very costly high-end rate for a mid-tier hotel.Suites are large but limited with only 1 bathroom.The other drawback is the 2 small slow elevators are insufficient for the hotel's size. There can be a long wait and they're very crowded at peak times.Another issue which may be a plus for some is that they appear to accepts guests with large dogs. There are signs posted that pets cannot use the main elevator which seem to be ignored.	
-	Mar 14 2009 	Great Location European size rooms clean and functional	This is located by wacker and michigan its a very good location, theres restaurants within close walking distance. Walls are too thin between rooms, I can actually hear the guy next door snore. Room fixtures are basic. Small rooms but adequate. Free bottled water unlimited - great! They should have these plastic bottles recycled though. Free wireless connectionBooked through booking.com and paid 95 dollars total for a night. if there are other hotels in the area with lower or comparable price, I might choose the other. If not then I can live with this hotel.	
+	Aug 15 2006 	Good location tiny rooms	OK, first things first, the rooms are small. Mine had a king size bed, with little room either side with a space at the bottom, then a desk. The bathroom is fine, but no bath.If the size of the room is an issue, then don't stay here. I have to say it really didn't bother me over the course of my two night stay.The staff were courteous, happy to answer questions, but were a little cold and unwelcoming.The room was clean, and the bed comfy and the views were pretty good.The building itself is beautiful, particularly as it towers towards its peak. My colleague was staying high up and there were only two rooms on that floor. Due to the shape of the building the room was an odd shape.The hotel is centrally located and great for sightseeing. At night it can feel a bit cold since really its a business district.If you want some nightlife I can recommend Hubbard Street a few blocks north where there are quite a few bars.For the price and location this was a pretty good deal.	
+	Apr 15 2008 	In need of a renovation but great hotel	Having read all the reviews, I was a little weary about booking this hotel, however I'm glad I did, it's a great hotel. I can understand why some reviewers made the comments they did, as the hotel does need a make over and the rooms do look a little jaded. Some of the furniture is straight out of the seventies and the decor in the room sometimes makes you feel as if you've travelled back in time, but that's about the only bad point. The suite was very spacious and clean with daily maid service. The room came with two double beds in a big bedroom, a lounge with a TV, a dining table and a fully furnished kitchen, with oven, hob, dish washer, microwave, kettle, toaster and all the cutlery and crockery you would need. The best thing about this hotel is the location, it's about a 5 minute walk from Michigan Avenue (The Golden Mile), where all the shops are. It's also close to the lake front and the red line rail station. I recommend the steak house restaurant adjoining the hotel, but be warned book early. While the hotel does need a make over, the suite sizes and the location means that if I return to Chicago, I'd have no problem staying here again.

-	Apr 16 2007	Nice building - lazy staff	The building is clean and rooms large, but the staff is really bad. We had to ask 3 times for extra towels before we got them; there is very little parking because you have to jockey with the staff to find a spot; staff parked in handicapped space 2 nights in a row; area around pool was dangerously wet from group of splashing, yelling kids; we were given two incorrect bills before insisting on a correct printed version.DO NOT stay here expecting a relaxing time away from home.	
+	Aug 11 2008 	Very Comfortable Great location	This hotel was great. The rooms were large and clean. The beds were unbelievably comfortable with nice linens. The bathroom was large, clean, up to date, and loaded with soft towels. And it's worth mentioning that the hotel had real, high-powered hair dryers -- not those terrible wall-mounted ones that you see in other hotels (I'm a women with thick long hair so I care about things like that). The view from my room was great. It looked out over the river. The staff was very accommodating, which you'd expect in a 4-star hotel. It was the fastest check-in I've ever experienced. Also, the concierge had great recommendations. The lounge/bar was expensive but very nice. They had a great wine list, appetizers, and friendly service.The location is fantastic. It's a very short walk to the Magnificent Mile, plenty of restaurants, the Navy Pier, the train, and there is a cab stand right in front and a Dunkin Donuts next door. A cab from Midway Airport was $35. A cab from Wrigley was $13. My only complaint about the hotel is that the mini bar has a weight sensor. So if you move around bottles in the fridge so that you can store your own food/personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged. Or that's at least what the front desk told me. Considering how much this hotel costs, it would be nice if they provided you with a fridge large enough to store your own items in it. Through hotwire, I paid $200 per night for Thursday-Sunday. It was a great deal. I get the impression that normally it is much more.	
+	May 6 2008 	Gorgeous hotel with a great view	My mom and I spent the weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel. Thanks to TravelZoo I was able to find an amazing deal - lakeside rooms for $129/night as part of a spring promotion. We took the train from O'Hare and had approximately a half-mile walk from the nearest station - it's a bit far if you're tired, have a lot of bags, or if the weather's bad. We didn't mind and were pleased with the hotel's location in general - very walkable to the major sights.Once we got there we checked in quickly and were pleased with our double room on the 10th floor overlooking the Chicago River, Lake Michigan, and Navy Pier. The room was very well appointed and clearly had been recently renovated. Great beds. The bathroom was large and modern, but the corner shower was a bit cramped and water invariably leaked onto the floor each time. A hassle...not a deal-breaker.The hotel lounge was a great place to grab a bite and a drink. Look for a coupon for a free appetizer on the bottom of the breakfast order door hanger in your room - it'll save you up to $20 on the very expensive (but delicious) appetizer selections at the lounge. We were able to get tickets for a special exhibit at the Art Institute through the Concierge - it saved us from waiting in a very long line at the museum.	
+	Jan 15 2008 	Comfortable!	Stayed for 3 nights the first part of December. Hotel was booked by tour bus company. I found the hotel room to be very comfortable. It took them a bit to get my luggage to my room, however there was alot of luggage and I was on one of the top floors. Loved the Aveda shampoo/conditioner/lotion etc. It was replenished everyday. I always like that. Was within walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and had nice little bakery down the street. I didn't dine in the hotel, so I can't tell you about the food. Walking back to the hotel after the theatre was not a problem, felt very safe, although it was Christmas time and the streets were packed. I would go back. I rated it 3 circles because I actually didn't utilize any of their ammenities at the hotel so I really can't judge. I was gone all day shopping. But when I got back to my room it was very comfortable. Maybe though they could have more channels and a larger TV.	
+	Dec 7 2007 	Wonderful Hotel	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Drake hotel for an anniversary get away this past weekend. We booked and paid for a king room two weeks before our arrival. We received a free upgrade to an executive suite upon checkin. Our room (number 625, the Churchill Suite) was enormous with great views of both the lake and the city. The room was clean &amp; the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious with an ok bathtub &amp; a nice seperate shower. We had no complaints with the room &amp; would highly recommend spending the extra $$ to get a suite at this hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful. The hotel staff was courteous &amp; helpful from check in to check out. Valet was very prompt upon check in but a little unorganized when we checked out. Things to definitly do at this hotel: Sunday brunch at the Drake Bros. restaurant. Pricey but well worth the $$. Entertainment in the Palm Court on Saturday evening. They had a jazz group there the night we stayed &amp; they were very good. Check out the shops on the lower level of the hotel before heading out to Michigan Ave. Things to skip:If you don't like tight crowded spaces...skip dining in the Cape Cod restaurant.The Saturday night lines can be long waiting for the hotel staff to get a cab for you. Take the 1 minute walk to the end of the block &amp; you will be in a cab much quicker than waiting in front of the hotel. If you do have access to the Executive Lounge don't bother. This was the only thing we were dissapointed with. It had the exact same view that we had in our suite. There was a very small bar with a bartender that was not as friendly as the bartenders in other parts of the hotel. They have a free breakfast in the lounge but we opted for room service after our experience in there the evening before.	
-	Jun 26 2004	So-so	Attracted by an excellent discounted room rate, we stayed at the Drake and had Thanksgiving dinner there last year. People who pay in full won't get what they pay for.It was fun to be in the lobby of an &quot;older&quot; city hotel as opposed to the bland environment of so many chain establishments. Some Chicago businesses had advertising displays in cabinetlike niches. Uniformed bellhops bustled about. A towering, decorated tree heralded the holiday season along with an electric-train layout. The entire area was nicely paneled, carpeted, and appointed. Too bad we went upstairs.. The &quot;family room&quot; proved to have a good-sized double bed and nothing more for sleeping. (The couch didn't fold out.) Without our having to wait all that long, a surly employee brought up a cot which turned out to have a somewhat lumpy mattress. Fortunately we were only there one night.Space in the room was adequate. The mirror and glass shelves above the minibar provided a nice touch. The bathroom was roomy and clean. Furnishings were OK aside from the lumpy cot and cheesy radio. There was a decent view of Michigan Avenue to be had from the large windows.Dinner was served in a pleasing atmosphere with efficient, swift, and congenial servers. The food, particularly the desserts, was less than spectacular given the cost of the meal. 	
+	Apr 14 2009 	A classic hotel beautifully refurbished with the nicest staff in a great location.	The Palmer House was recently renovated and the public rooms gleam. They reflect the luxury of turn-of-the-century Chicago (and are historic enough to be the subject of a local architecture tour). At least half of the guest rooms have been completely renovated; I stayed in one of these. The bed was very comfortable. The room itself was large, well-lit, and well-appointed. Two of the old very small rooms had been combined into one spacious double. I'm sure other guests have had different experiences, even recently, as the rooms vary quite a bit in size, layout, and location, and some have not been completely renovated. I found that if you ask for what you want, and talk with the reservation/front desk people, they are accomodating, and if the first room doesn't fit your needs, they'll try to find one that does. Do be aware, though, that most rooms either look into inner courtyards or out onto busy streets. This is not the hotel for great views, from most rooms. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful; I've never been warmly greeted and smiled at by so many. I love the location; around the corner from Symphony Hall and the Art Institute, near the theaters, Millenium Park, and Marshall Fields (now sadly a Macy's) and the rest of State Street shopping. Many options for food, both elegant and quick, including takeout, are available within a few blocks. I stayed at a convention rate so don't know how good the rates are in general.	
-	Aug 12 2008 	Caffeine-free Zone	If you stay at a Motel 6 you get free coffee. Super 8, same. This Hilton, no way. Couldn't believe it, but it's true. No coffee pot in the room, no coffee pot in the lobby. The morning street level (not the lobby, which is one floor up) is a steady stream of bleary-eyed people walking out to the street to find the Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts or McDonald's, and the opposing stream of people coming back to the hotel with a cup or two of ($1.50-$4.00) coffee. C'mon, Hilton, have a heart! A cup of joe would make life just a lot better.Oh, by the way, the walls are pretty thin.The shower was great.Wi-fi daily rates are exorbitant.Check-in and -out were a breeze.The wait for an elevator was never more than a minute.Sheets are SOFT.	
+	Mar 8 2009 	Wonderful Family Trip	Amid comments of, why are you going to Chicago in March?, I planned a short trip and booked a room at the Peninsula. My wife and I were accompanied by our two children . Our son is aged 5 and and our daughter is aged 18 months. We had never been to the Peninsula before, but its reputation convinced me to stay there. I arranged through the hotel to have a car to meet us at the airport upon our arrival. Inside the terminal a man was waiting for us holding a Peninsula Hotel sign. He greeted us and led us outside to the waiting car. Our car was a black Lincoln stretch limousine. My son loved the car and the driver whisked us away from the airport for a relaxing ride to the hotel. We pulled up to the hotel which is guarded by two very large oriental lion statues. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman named Timothy. He took my name and said our bags would be delivered to our room shortly. We proceeded inside the hotel and took the elevator to the lobby to check in. We were greeted warmly as we completed our check in. The Lobby Restaurant room was near the elevators and it is just as stunning in person as in all pictures I had seen of it. The friendly woman who checked us in led us to the elevator and took us to our room on the twelfth floor. We had booked a junior suite #1217 because we needed the space. The room was done in shades of yellow and gold. The truly great hotels always do the little things that set them apart and the Peninsula accomplished this brilliantly. On the cocktail table in front of the sofa in the living room was a paper model of a 1956 light blue Ford Thunderbird convertible. Inside the seating compartment was a linen napkin wrapped around two chocolate chip cookies. Next to the car was a martini glass filled with gummy bears. Next to the martini glass was a small teacup and saucer and a small silver spoon. Inside the teacup was orange gelatin. There was also a beautiful purple box of Vosges Haut-Chocolat exotic truffles on the desk. The room looked out onto N. Michigan Avenue and the large window made the view exceptional. The room was spacious and inviting. The next wonderful detail that the hotel accomplished still puts a smile on my face. In the closet were robes for us to wear while we relaxed. There were two adult robes and two robes for the children. The robes for the children had hoods and were sized so as to fit them each perfectly. We got some great photographs of the kids in those robes. The room was equipped with consoles by the bed that controlled all the environmental adjustments for the room. The bathroom was gorgeous and well-equipped. There was a television that could be viewed while bathing in the bathtub. The kids loved watching TV while taking their evening baths. Turn down service was completed every evening much to our satisfaction. We had lunch at the french bistro connected to the hotel. The food and service were both excellent. After our visit to the observation deck of the Sears Tower, we returned to the hotel and had dinner at the Lobby Restaurant. This restaurant is a gorgeous palatial space. The food was wonderful as was our server Don. I enjoyed a Peninsula Martini and my wife enjoyed her Blood Orange Martini. After dinner we retired to our room and I slept deeply on the very comfortable bed. The next morning, I watched the kids while my wife indulged in a swedish massage at the Spa. She said Donald did a great job. After that we all had breakfast in the the french bistro and headed out to see some of the culture of the city. We took the kids to the Science and Industry Museum, Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago. The weather was cooperative with the temperature in the mid to upper 40's and mostly sunny. The Cloud Gate was fun to see in person. Upon our return to the hotel, my son and I enjoyed the pool and the hot tub before we went to dinner. What a scenic setting to swim laps. I loved it. I wanted to try Chicago style pizza on our last night so I phoned the Concierge and she recommended either Gino's East or Giordano's. Since we had the kids, we chose Giordano's because it was right across the street on North Rush Street. We ordered the stuffed pizza and it was incredibly good. I was raised on the thin crust pizza of New Haven, Connecticut but I got to tell you, the stuffed pizza here, while different ,was every bit as enjoyable as any pizza I have ever had. After dinner we retired to our room, bathed the kids and fell asleep. The next morning we had an early breakfast in the Lobby Restaurant. Again, the food and service were excellent. We returned to our room and collected our luggage and proceeded to check out. I used the express checkout method and we took the elevator to the ground level. Timothy the doorman saw us off and our limousine returned us to O'Hare for our trip home. What a fabulous stay at the Chicago Peninsula.	
+	Apr 26 2008 	I wish I could go back everyday...	Hotel was very clean. The staff was so nice. I think that this hotel was phenomonal. I had a great stay. They were very nice to children. The lobby was very nice and relaxing. It was a great weekend stay. Ask for Patty or Shannon because they were so kind. Bob was a great bellman. The Doorman was also very nice. I think the Silversmith Hotel is a great choice when visiting Chicago.	
-	Jun 26 2007 	Horrible Dingy Expensive	We had a similar experience another guest did on this site - we arrived from Los Angeles in the evening and when we got to the hotel the room we were promised had been given to someone else but would be available the next night. When I said we had a confirmed room and showed the woman at the desk our confirmation number she shrugged and said &quot;we can't guarantee the rooms&quot;. THEN WHY EVEN BOOK THEM? This woman was unhelpful, quietly rude and didn't care in the least. They finally found a room for us and it was horrible. Dingy, dark, gloomy and the window stared right out at the EL and this was a $400 room!. We went out to dinner and checked out The Hard Rock which was fantastic but booked but their rates were $100 LESS and the place was fantastic! In the morning we decided to leave (and found a room at the Chicago Athletic Club - an affiliate of the Los Angeles Athletic Club where we are members so it was great). The Silversmith had promised to charge us the same rate we were quoted when I made the reservation but when we checked out they charged us $50 more and couldn't take it off the computer. We had to wait for 1/2 an hour while they tried to figure out how to fix this. And to top it all off, our daughter left a shoe in the room and when we called the next day they said they didn't have it. I'm not sure they even looked for it. Anyway, this hotel was really horrible. We couldn't wait to get out of there and practically fled with our luggage as soon as we could the next morning.	
+	Mar 3 2005	Quiet Friendly Great Location	After reading a number of reviews of downtown's &quot;budget&quot; hotels on tripadvisor, we decided to splurge a little and go for the Silversmith - and we were not disappointed! Not having stayed in Chicago before, we were pleasantly surprised at how very quiet this hotel is. We took the advice of other reviewers and requested a room away from the El train, and it was just an occasional, 5-second, distant &quot;whoosh&quot; sound. It's nothing compared to the experience of staying in a hotel with an in-room blower! We couldn't even hear sounds from the street - It was amazingly quiet for being right downtown. That downtown location was equidistant from everything we wanted to see &amp; do - It's just a couple blocks from the Art Institute, Millenium Park (note that the Cloud Gate is under construction until spring), and the absolutely wonderful Berghoff restaurant. The room itself was super clean, well-appointed, nice high ceilings/windows, big bathroom, and comfy bed with lots of pillows. The hotel staff were all very courteous and friendly - When we mentioned to the front desk attendant that we would be stopping at the Museum of Science &amp; Industry on our way out of town, he gave us a pair of free passes that he happened to have that day! We found the hotel &amp; the city very accessible, with a nice, hometown feel that you don't find in places like NYC. The attached restaurant, Ada's, was also very good and reasonably priced, with great service. Try the potato pancakes! Overall an excellent experience.	
+	Jun 7 2006	A wonderful experience	We spent three nights at the Sutton Place Hotel. The location (right next to the Rush Street nightlife area, close to North Michigan Ave, only a few blocks from a Red Line subway stop) was handy. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, and all was immaculately clean. Hotel personnel were friendly and helpful. We were on the 19th floor and our room was extremely quiet. I wanted to take the shower home; it was strong, stayed at a constant temperature, and was mounted high enough that tall people (maybe not nba players) won't have to stoop. There was also a large soaking tub. I had never heard of this hotel, but I'd stay here again in a flash!	
+	Jun 13 2005	Clean and Friendly!!	Had a nice stay over Memorial Day Weekend. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the room which is extremely important to me. We were also on a non-smoking floor which was nice. Walls were a little too thin however. On Saturday night we had to listen to the cackling women in the room next door until 3:00 in the a.m. They were having a good time. I wasn't going to spoil their fun. Turn down service every night. Rooms come equipped with CD players but we didn't utilize it. Beds were extremely comfy. We were able to catch up on a lot of sleep. Location was o.k. It's about 45 minutes from O'Hare on the train. Not very convenient for sightseeing (like museums or boat tours) unless you like walking alot. There's always cabs and the red line which is about a 5 minute walk away. Hotel is directly across the street from great restaurants like Gibson's and the best margaritas in town at the Blue Agave. Oh, and the pancake house across the street has great breakfasts, but get there early. The line is out the door by 8:30. The staff, especially the doormen, were very friendly and helpful. Fresh fruit and complimentary newspapers awaited us in the lobby. It was a nice touch. I would stay here again if our itinerary included shopping on Michigan Ave and partying on Rush. However, if you're looking forward to visiting the Navy Pier, museums, and such, stay closer to the river.	
+	Jul 21 2009 	The best in Chicago	The Talbott must be the best, most convenient and comfortable hotel in Chicago!We had a kingsize room, with a huge bed with enough room for a bunch of people...The hotel style is &quot;European&quot; in an American way, which means dark colours and tartans.Not very stylish, but tres burgeois! The service was mediate, front desk could take advantage of more smiling, and snob down a little... The hotel is extremely well located, just off the Michigan Avenue with all the stylish shops and great reataurant.I would chose this hotel again!	
-	May 14 2005 	Just okay	Stayed at The Talbott for two nights with my husband and although it wasn't terrible, I expected better. The construction was a pain and made the lobby pretty smelly and dusty. Our room was okay but a looked a little battered with lots of nicks on the woodwork and scratches on the walls. Also had problems with the room temperature--it got very warm at night and the air conditioner didn't seem to work very effectively.	
-	Mar 23 2008 	Needs a Facelift	We booked a two night stay on a discount website at a great rate, so our expectations were not too high. As frequent visitors to Chicago, the location was perfect for our needs. The Tremont failed to meet our low expectations. First, there was no doorperson on duty when we arrived Friday afternoon during a spring snow storm. After entering the highly fragranced lobby (candles? potpourri? what is it hiding?), we approached the reception desk - nobody was visible. Looking over the counter, we greeted a seated person at the desk, who remained seated until we gave our name, etc., . She only stood when she requested my ID and credit card and accessed the computer. The moment she handed the cards and room keys to me, she took a bottle of hand sanitizer, squeezed it and spread it all over her hands. Lovely first impression...not helped by the container of Lysol wipes on the desk.  Believe everything you read about the elevator. It is small, slow, loud and wobbly. Any one of these alone can be overlooked, but combined creates a very unsafe feeling - especially when more than 2 people are in it.   Our room was small and relatively clean; the out of date decor made us feel like we were visiting a 70s version of a B &amp; B. The queen bed was quite firm, the sheets appeard to be clean. The headboard banged on the wall every time we sat on the bed. The outside walls were warped and uneven. The windows are poorly insulated and the one that faced the lake (yes, there was a partial view) was frosted over as a winter storm was underway. The wind howled loudly all night. I finally took the throw from the bed, rolled it up, and attempted to block the air. We had to turn the heat off in our room as the blower was so loud we couldn't sleep. And to top things off, the restaurant next door emptied their glass bottles into the dumpster around 2 am - directly below our other window.  As many others have stated, the bathroom needs updating. The tub was slow to drain and the toilet is slow to flush. Many tiles are cracked, wallpaper peeling and paint chipped. This lovely old building has great potential. I wonder why it hasn't been maintained the way it should be...	
+	Sep 16 2007 	old and charming  average hotel.	i stayed at the tremont hotel in early july a nice old english tudor hotel, it was not what i would call a three star standard hotel compared to europe hotels, a bit below, not so many amenities as listed. a bit below r what i thought it would bee,. a little worn down ,and old ,but it was a very charming old english tudor style hotel and i liked it .the rooms were nicely styled.a bit awkvard in the planning though with the toilet behind the door and telephone in bathroom etc ,still nice ,quaint..and it was ok.i thougth it would include breakfast but it didnt. but a restaurant lies right besides the hotel. the personnel a bit surly and not so overly friendly but ok anyway i liked the tremont overall a good hotel and cheap nice old english style too.john bevegard sweden stockholm.	
+	Feb 15 2007	Fabulous location!	When determining if you want to stay at this hotel, ask yourself WHY you are in Chicago. Are you in Chicago to spend most of your day out shopping, or are you there to enjoy staying in the hotel? If you want a really nice hotel and plan on spending a lot of time there, then this isn't the hotel for you. Yes, it's older and it does have some cosmetic issues. BUT, the location is awesome! Across the street is the Westin and I giggled to myself knowing what they paid for their POSH hotel, and what I paid for my average hotel. We probably have an equal amount of steps to Michigan Avenue, so location is mute. I personally go to Chicago to shop and eat out. I really don't care much about the quality of linens or the speed of the elevator. I want convenience for a low price. This is it!	
+	Apr 5 2003	Very positive surprise!!		
+	Jun 2 2008 	One of the Best SPG Property In Town!	Stayed at this lovely property during the memorial day weekend. The hotel occupency rates were low so got upgraded to a nice 1 BR Suite upon arrival. The room is spacious, clean, and comfortable.The hotel is situated right next to the river so some of the rooms will have a view of the river. The hotel has 20 floors where the top 4 floors are the executive floors where they have free Wired internet access and iMac to use in room (this is one of the coolest thing I found at this property, not even W offers that). The room features typical Westin Heavenly Bed, Heavenly Shower and 37&quot; LCD TV. The hotel has an executive lounge located on the 20th floor for guests staying at the club level. I think it is worth to stay at the club level if you are trying to save few bucks on breakfast n etc. They do have a nice selection of contiental breakfast &amp; evening cocktails and I do love the way they decorate their lounge. You can just sit there and enjoy the river view on a quiet day., very nice!The hotel has a fully equipped gym (very nice), no swimming pool (oh wells), and they have a nice japanese restaurant on site (hana lounge) where you can order it from your room as well. The check in agents were friendly and eager to help, so does bell desk and concierge desk lady provided lots ideas on where to go/eat/shop..etc. Very helpful! The hotel is 5 minutes easy walk to the nearest subway station ( Clark / Lake) and its right across from the house of blues and Harry Carrey (sp?) restaurant which serves great steak, close to the Michigan Ave for those who likes to shop. I just have too many great things to say for this property, I would definitely refer and stay at this property again when I go back to Chicago	
+	Dec 21 2005	great weekend at the westin !	Just returned from a long weekend of shopping and celebrating in Chicago. The Westin proved to be a great home base. Our room was large and comfortable and the bathroom, done in black marble, was also quite large and stylish. The hotel gym is far superior to most and never crowded. The lobby overlooks the bar area which creates a great atmosphere to have a drink/appetizer in. The staff was friendly and the location was ideal for Michigan Ave. or the loop. We would suggest taking the 2 block walk to the Mambo Grill to start an evening with their mojitos then walking 2 more blocks to Fado for a perfectly poured Guinness. Did I mention we did some celebrating ?	
+	Jul 7 2009 	Great Spot Nice Hotel Ambiance	Stayed here for three days on business and found the hotel to be very nice. I got a room at the back, end of the building, which allowed a larger , comfortable room. The staff was extremely attentive. The hotel has a very nice, older world anbaince. The bar is like a fabulous old men's club - heavy paneling, sumptuous sofas and low lighting - very, very nice place to work during the day when the bar is closed. Although it may be a personal taste thing; and older couple walked through while I was there and I heard the elderly gentleman say, &quot;This is like a funeral parlour&quot;! I certainly disagreed with him! Not much lobby, but i didn't need one. Right near the Hancock Tower, restaurants and great shopping.	
-	Dec 13 2007 	Overrated	Stayed here on business - i've been around the world and was unimpressed. The price i paid was a corporate rate and still felt it was too much for the quality of of the stay. While i realize I am paying for location - off the Magnificent Mile - the hotel was just - blah.	
+	Apr 26 2004	A quiet comfortable spot in the midst of the action.	I was surprised to see negative reviews of this hotel. We spent 3 nights in a pinnacle level guest room in April 2004 and could not have been more pleased. Yes, the rooms are not new and swanky, but ours was large and pleasantly decorated. The bed was comfortable and made up with high quality linens. Where the Whitehall excells is in the level of service. We were treated well by everyone from the doorman to the restaurant staff. They all went out of their way to be helpful and were very generous about offering substitutions at breakfast for my diabetic husband. (Continental breakfast was included for pinnacle level guests but they gave us cooked food every morning.) Waiters and bar staff not only remembered us each day, but also remembered our preferences. If you like kir, try one of Joe's delicious french martinis.	
+	Nov 2 2009 	Top notch in every sense of the word	Just returned from a brief but memorable stay at the Wit. I read the reviews and changed my reservation from the Marriott just to see what the buzz was about. I wasn't disappointed.First class check in. Professional, courteous and very friendly. Gave my sister and I the lay of the land and offered suggestions on a place to find a costume for Halloween. They were hosting an event with a $1,000 cash prize! Had drinks at the Roof. Nick our bartender couldn't have been nicer. He remembered us by first name when we went back later in the evening - how often does that happen anymore?Bellmen and doormen were the best! Huge smiles, welcomed us back every time we entered the hotel. Just an all around nice feeling.I would highly recommend treating yourself to this hotel.	
+	Jun 11 2009 	Best Hotel in Chicago one of the best in the world	Without doubt the best hotel in Chicago and one of the best hotels in the world. My wife and I were in Chicago to visit our son and decided to stay in the Trump as we had stayed in the Peninsula and Four Seasons in previous years. Our city view room was exceptional and larger than most suites that I have stayed in. There was a kitchen in our room which is vital for people living away from home for two weeks. It was ideal to have the option to eat out or just to relax in our room and have something light to eat.The gym facilities are amazing. The view from the gym is worth going there alone but when I did pretend to work out my treadmill had its own fan and iPod docking station. Simple idea but something that is not in very many gyms. Of course it was spotless and appeared to have equipment for a serious workout or a guy like me just going through the motions.When we ate breakfast at 16 (the restaurant within the hotel) we received personlized attention and exceptional service from our server (he showed us where the best views were in the foyer so that we could take better pictures of the Chicago skyline for our family to see). I normally don't eat breakfast but 16 made me break that rule every day throughout my stay.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. It is very well priced for the service and quality of hotel.	
+	Jul 11 2008 	Great hotel great location	My wife, 3 month old son, and i stayed at the Trump for 3 nights. It shouldn't make any difference, but the building is still under construction. This didn't impact the hotel at all other than the scaffolding outside the building. No noise or other inconvenience. I've stayed in only a few other really high end hotels and this was definitely the best. The staff was very friendly and greeted my son by name several times. The room was huge (600sf) and had all sorts of neat &quot;extras&quot; (42&quot; LCD tv, tv build into the bathroom mirror, fully stocked kitchenette with very nice items, Bose clock-radio with iPod dock, electric curtains), very comfortable bed. Bath products are top notch. My wife said &quot;this is the first hotel I've been where I wasn't skeeved out about the sheets and never saw a single hair in the bathroom.&quot; The only complaints, and you have to take them in reference to the hotel being 5 star, are that there were some marks on the walls as if luggage had rubbed, and the turn down service never returned one day and had to be called the 2nd day. Minor issues for sure, but if you're talking about a 5 star hotel, that's a high standard. I'd definitely recommend it, but I also have to say we got a very good price of about $300 per night. I don't think I'd pay the usual rate of $450 or more per night for ANY hotel.	
+	Jun 2 2008 	Crisp and Modern Reasuringly Nonpretentious HUGE ROOMS!	Booked a room at the Chicago Trump on Valentine's Day. The hotel hadn't officially opened yet, and so scored a great rate on the grand deluxe 1-bedroom suite. To be honest I really wanted to hate this hotel, but upon my night's stay I have to admit that it is instantly competitive with Chicagos finest five-star properties. The lobby is small and, check-in was quite pleasant. Readily available employees everywhere you look, but nonintrusive at the same time. Decor is very pleasant- very minimalist and modern, and everywhere you look there are panoramic views of the Chicago skyline, river and lake Michigan. Suite was HUGE. 1,000+ SQ feet, could have entertained 60-70 easily. Floor to ceiling windows with fabulous views (see pix) and great full kitchen with everything youd need to make five-star meal (they actually offer in-room chef service). Recommend both Sixteen and ReBar for views and food that compete with other fine dining establishments as well as hotel bars. Cant wait for Sixteens patio to open summer of 2009.	
-	Aug 15 2008 	Not the best experience but probably not representative...	My company recently added a sales office in Chicago, so I made the trip out from NY to Chicago. Our office is 1.5 blocks away from the W, so I decided to book here instead of at the Westin (the other approved hotel on the list where we get a special rate).I've had good experiences with W properties in the past (San Diego, Los Angeles, Tuscany in NY), so I expected something similar. It wasn't great.The good news is that my original trip was canceled because of that horrendous NY-area weather. My flight was canceled by air traffic control, and I ended up calling the W at the last minute and telling them my predicament. To my surprise, they waived the cancellation fee, even though it had nothing to do with them. That was a big plus in my book.The bad news is that when I made it out a week later, the only smoking room available (I smoke cigars and thought it'd be nice to be able to smoke in the room) was one with double beds. The beds were so soft that if someone told me that two elephants had sex in them the night before, I would have believed you. That was really disappointing.The condition of the room wasn't great, either--scuff marks on the walls, molding come off the base of the walls, etc.On the plus side, room service was good (the bucatini is phenomenal) and generally prompt (May, the person who brought up my food the first night, even went out of her way to give me a card with her name on it).I travel a lot for business and so I'm willing to chalk it up to a bad one-off experience, so I'll try it again in the future with the W. However, I'm staying at the Hard Rock Chicago next time to see what else is out there.	
-	Aug 25 2006 	Edgy	Walking into the W, you immediatly notice that they're going for a cool, trendy, edgy vibe. It's very different from most hotels. The lobby area, or &quot;lving room&quot; as they call it, is 2-story, dark, with techno music and constant video displays on 2 walls. I actually liked it alot, but some people at the conference I was attending did not. The staff is young and uniformly helpful and accommodating. I read some reviews on here before going which led me to believe that they would be snobby but I didn't find that to be the case at all. It's an old building from the 20s so that means it has some beautiful architectural features -- our meeting room was fabulous! But also leads to some variation in rooms. My first room was small, dark, and worst of all the air conditioning did not seem to be working so it was hot. After a couple of calls, I got moved to a much nicer room that was larger, lighter, and cooler. Many of the people at my conference were saying that their rooms were small, so watch out for that. The hallwasy are very dark, I'm not sure why. Part of the atmosphere I guess. It's light enough to see, just different from what you're used to. Very comfortable beds, bedding, nice bath products (Bliss). I thought it was kind of expensive, probably wouldn't stay here again because of that and the location, but I did like it. It's located in the financial district so mostly surrounded by office buildings. You have to walk several blocks to get to most shopping and restaurants. It is pretty close to the Art Institute. I'd rather stay on north Michigan Ave. W has another location on Lakeshore Drive, too.	
+	Feb 1 2008 	one of my fave hotels	This is one of my favorite hotels to stay at.It's right on the lake. The rooms are great - great layout, decor, amount of space.Cool bar.	
+	Aug 9 2004	Awesome hotel but pricey	This hotel was amazing. Below are my bulleted comments about the good and not so good.The Good:- The location is awesome. You can walk to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. It is a short cab ride away to all other Chicago attractions.- The zen decor was beautiful. The rooms were beautiful. We asked for and upgrade to a suite and they were kind enough to accommodate us, even on a weekend (it may have helped that I'm a Gold Starwood member, so I don't know if they do that for everyone).- The service of every single staff person was amazing.- The exercise room and pool were very nice.- The view of the lake was nice. The city view rooms aren't as great, but cheaper.- The beds are heavenly as they are in all the Westins, W's and some Sheratons.- The bath care products were Aveda and were awesome.- It has three of the hottest and swakiest bars in all of Chicago. The bar on the top floor is a see and be seen bar of Chicago. It was pretty cool to stay at such a happenin' place.The Not so Good:- I was able to use some Starwood points for the stay or else I don't know that we could have afforded the room. Everything else was very pricey (i.e., parking is $39/night, but we found this to be about the going rate at all other hotels and public parking in the area)- I can't think of anything else that wasn't good about this hotel. You just have to know going into it that it will be pricey, but it is well worth it because it is an amazing hotel.	
+	Oct 20 2009 	Designed for business travelers but nice all around	I actually stayed here for business and then stayed an extra night for leisure. The rooms are geared more towards the professional with a kind of minimalist elegance. Almost a 50s or 60s style, like you would see in the show Mad Men.It is actually located in Itasca, about a 30 minute drive into downtown, but I highly recommend taking the train into town instead of driving. It only costs like $6 for a one-way pass and on the weekends $10 gets you unlimited rides! You save so much on parking and on your hotel room by taking the train into downtown. Plus they run as late as 12:45AM, so you can still enjoy the nightlife. I actually got my shoes shined as well, and it was done well for $10 or so. The only downside is that the bar, etc close early. But you would probably be downtown anyway if you were planning on enjoying the nightlife. We happened to catch a free concert on Navy Pier; the weather was beautiful, the music free and fun; it was a good time all around!	
+	Oct 5 2006 	Great stay at the Wyndham	Just returned from a 3 night stay, attending a business seminar. Excellent service, right from arrival. Very helpful and informed staff. Early check-in allowed. No hassles. Comfortable, clean rooms, with nice views of the city skyline, or Lake Michigan. Excellent meal at the Caliterra Restaurant, with yummy martinis at the lounge. The luncheons provided for the seminar were also great. Ideal location for getting around the city. It was my first time in Chicago and I would definitely return, and stay again at the Wyndham.	
+	Sep 11 2006	Some good some bad.	Great location, close to the Mile and restaurants with outside dining. The beds are very uncomfortable!! We booked a corner king room--huge windows, very bright, nice room....Wish the beds were better.	
+	Nov 2 2009 	Good Family Hotel	It was a good experience as the Hotel was situated at the heart of Dubai and from there everything was near the market and the malls and the Breakfast of the Hotel was the USP it was lavish and multi-cuisine type will definitely go there again and stay if get a chance.	
-	May 23 2008 	Def. not a 4*	we had a few problems with this hotel- and these problems make that relaxing holiday a stressful one!transfers did not arrive, we even phoned fromt he airport, they kept saying the he was in arrivals, but checked many times (also it is difficult to miss someone dressed in bright blue). So that was complete lie, as i guess it costs them to get someone out there.on arrivals the staff, had the phone call and knew we were on our way, but check in- took an hour at the hotel. (the room was not tidy or ready).the staff were really unhelpful -asked about certain tours etc, they refused to help and look busy. They asked us to speak to the concierge every day.(every morning we waited for him at 9am!)The concierge was never there!! only got to saw him on the last day.Then he would not stop buggin us to get on the tours.staff refused to get taxis for u. Breakfast was ok. Room size was ok- bed was really UNCOMFORTABLE.Bath/shower was not the 4* standard u expect.The only plus point is that IT IS NEAR THE CITY CENTRE, WHERE U CAN ARRANGE TOURS .etc. Other wise the location is not great, taxis refuse to go there.well i have been to dubai many time, maybe the expectations are the same each time; but im starting to see a decline in the quality of service provided. But the places i would recommend are shei.Zayed road.jumeirah. and creek.this hotel is overall a 3*.	
+	Mar 31 2009 	4* hotel but 5* quality ~ a total gem in the old town	Just returned from a 7 night stay at this fabulous central hotel. We selected it on price for an early break and we were not disappointed.The rooms are really cleverly designed and made to feel spacious, the open bathroom wasn't such an issue for us being a married couple, however if you like a bit of privacy then this may not suit you. The shower and toilet are enclosed, but still not very private.Breakfast was relaxing and very substantial, the staff are very pleasant, friendly yet professional. Concierege and desk staff are a credit to the hotel (as indeed are all staff including housekeeping). We used room service a couple of evenings and the meals were really good and very reasonably priced. We celebrated birthdays whilst there and they hotel sent a delicous cake when they saw the birthday cards on display, which we thought was a lovely touch as we did not tell the hotel, about our birthdays.The sports bar does lovely meals and drinks. Prices are a bit steeper than we are used to but this is Dubai and the current exchange rate means we are paying more that we used to.The pool is not huge but considering it is a city hotel then it is adequate, the loungers are very nice, however there are not many, and whilst other reviewers have said that they never had a problem getting one, that was not the case when we visited. The gym is just beside the pool (door next to the toilets )and they have a water dispenser in there, the staff didn't seem to mind everyone helping themselves to much needed top of water bottles.We used the business centre a couple of days, one to find out a place we wanted to visit and another to check in on line for the flight home. The internet use is free of charge.Sadly the weather was a bit iffy when we stayed, and we had quite severe rain a couple of days, and even huge hailstones one night, but this didn't spoil the holiday, we just had to hit the shops and spend more money. The Dubai Mall is a sight to see, and not completely full of shops yet, but the aquariam is fabulous. It is walking distance. The tallest building the Burj Dubai is breathtaking and photos cannot do it justice. We would definately go back to Al Manzil, and probably will sometime in the future	
+	Oct 18 2008 	Weekend in Duabi - Birthday surprise by the staff	Excellent hotel, perfect location and the staff were very friendly and true assets to the property.I had travelled overnight from London Heathrow to Dubai via Doha for the weekend. The hotel allowed me to check-in early. The check-in staff member, Reva was very friendly and wished me happy birthday as she realised from the passport details. The Duty Manger came over and welcomed me to the property. I was very impressed by the room, it seemed quiet large for a 4* property as I've stayed in smaller 5* rooms. What made the room unique and large was the bath area which the right side of the room whilst the left side of the room was the bed area. This was unique as the bath was literally in the same room. It was ideal for me but not sure if it would suit couples or friends sharing a room. As the bath did not have any curtained area. Although for the shy the room did have a separate which had a frosted glass door as did the toilet area.Bath was good, big enough for two. The bath ameinty's were nice. What was nice was how the TV stand (mini-bar) revolved so I could watch CNN whilst enjoying the bubbles.The location was ideal, it was right in the middle of Old Town Burj Dubai, which is infact the new part of Dubai. The hotel is next to Dubai Mall which is due to open soon so it will be ideal for those that wish to avoid the crowds of Jumeirah. As the Atlantis- The Palm only cost 50 Dhirams to get to by taxi. Which was great as I had pre-booked the Dolphin Bay experience, which allowed me to swim with a dolphin and gave me access to the Lost Chambers and Aquaventure. On my return I decided to open my fast at the cafe in the hotel where I had a nice strawberry milkshake. On return to my room, I settled down down to watch TV. I got surprised when a I heard a knock on the door, went over to open the door where Hazel and 2 other staff members came in singing Happy Birthday and brought me a cake. Which was delicious. Have never been so impressed in my life. It was brilliant, it was my first birthday away from friends and family. They later e-mailed me the pictures.I later decided to sample the room-service menu. Ordered the watermelon juice and the Al -Manzil Burger which came with a really nice BBQ sauce. Later on in the night I had another knock on the door, the hotel had sent me a gift. Again another example of the hotel staff going over and beyond. This hotel is a true star and really deserves to be recognised as a 4* Plus property with 5* services. What I liked was the personal service by the staff which is usually not found in larger 5* properties in Dubai.	
+	Sep 16 2008 	Wow!!	Dubai is the home of bling so it's refreshing to see a hotel taking its own route! Al Manzil really stands out with a genuinely contemporary style that is imaginative, different and atmospheric.I guarantee you won't have ever stayed in a bedroom quite like it. Kind of open plan with a bathtub at the foot of your bed, flanked by various cubicles and a curvaceous TV stand full of drinkies and snacks. Very cute lighting that creates an instant mellow feel and a really beautiful vanity sink lit-up like a Moroccan lantern. It's really peachy.As a business hotel there were some issues. It is quite new so maybe they are still working it all out. Sorry to say the Dubai internet curse was in full flow. No wireless connection in the room at all during my time here. That's a serious problem. &quot;Sorry Mister Soft the wireless is down&quot;. So I decamped to the business centre, which had working internet but a non-working printer. It got fixed but the duty manager clearly had zero knowledge or training in IT support.Only after leaving did my colleague casually mention that his room wireless worked fine throughout. Hmm, it was all a lie then.Anyway aside from that an absolutely splendid and quite beautifully styled hotel that would fit the bill perfectly for a groovy young couple or romantic getaway.	
+	Jul 21 2009 	One of the best Hotels in the world	Stayed for 10 days and the hotel delivered everything we could have hoped for and then loads on top. The service was outstanding, every member of staff could not do enough to help, (and having a baby this meant a lot) The Executive club is a must extra, that is worth ever penny and the staff in the club (especially Sunny) are happy to arrange and sort every thing out for you.Food was amongst the best that I have ever had, and with 27 restaurants to choose from, every culinary delight was available.9 swimming pools to choose from, however the main pool was extremely large and most of it is only 3 feet deep, again great for the kids. Life guards are stationed every few hundred yards around the pool, so I have never felt safer with the kids.The beach was great, very clean (cleaned every night) and sea was very warm.We visited both the burj and Atlantis, but would pick Al Qasr every time. The Berj is not a family hotel and the service at the Atlantis was extremely poor.This hotel offers everything that a holiday should provide. The travel around the hotel by golf buggy or small boat, which were always ready to take you were ever you wanted to go.My only complaint would be the gym, which is a bit out dated (the weights area) the cardio machines were very good and had fans built in to keep you cool, along with the staff bringing you chilled towels to wipe yourself down.The souk was most interesting, but expensive (you are in a top 5* hotel complex) and as we had use of a car, cheaper bargains could be had at some of the other shopping malls or markets. Any one who goes to Dubai has to visit the gold souk.This hotel is as good as the Hotel de Paris in Mote Carlo for style and quality, and better on every other level. 10 out of 10.We will definitely go back.	
+	Apr 28 2008	Expensive Dubai	We holiday in Dubai twice a year normally in April &amp; October and have done so for the last five years. We have stayed at either the One &amp; Only Royal Mirage or as per this review the Al Qsar on Jumeria Beach.Although the hotel and staff are just what any 5* hotel should be the buzz around the hotel was the massive price increase on all food and drink. If it was your first time you would just think it was expensive but if you were able to compare it to a previous visit as most of the people are able to do, the price rises were past being funny. 2 kids milkshakes around the pool were £12.00 and a meal at Pai Thai for two adults and one child with two glasses of wine came to £225.00. The hotel seems to be cashing in on the customer before the alternative hotels offer any competition. Although the hotel is still a great location, save up your spending money or you may get a nasty shock!!!!	
+	Sep 25 2006 	Good Central Location	Just returned from a 2 day stay at the Arabian Courtyard.The hotel is in a great spot for exploring Deira and Bur Dubai.There is a free bus to a beach park about 10 K away. (But it costs 5 dirham to get in.)The staff where all friendly and willing. We arrived at 9am and tried to check in. We were informed that check in was not until 2pm (Which we knew from the booking) but they said as soon as a room was available we could have it. After a short walk we arrived back at 10.30 and a room was ready. The rooms are large and comfortable with quiet and effiecint air conditioning. Which was just as well as it was 40C outside. As others have said the pool area is basic and is overlooked by a construction site. But there was not any work in progress so there was no noise. The pool itself looked OK but the water was so warm and the outside temperatures so hot that there was little point in going in. The bathroom is very nice, but a little on the small side. Taxi from the airport was 42 Dirhams and took about 15 minutes in fairly heavy traffic. The return trip was only 20 as it appears that an airport tax is added on taxis from the airport.This is a perfect hotel to explore the old City and ideal for a stop over. If you are going for a beach and sun holiday then look elsewhere.	
+	Jan 19 2009 	Best service level ever	Very nice hotel and typical Las Vegas style looks. Rooms are however very, very disappointing for the very, very expensive price you pay for staying here. Restaurants and pools are fantastic and the water park is the best in the world. Hotel staff are available everywhere and the level of attentoin and service is the best and can't be beat. They really treat you very, very well everywhere reception, bell desk, security gards in the hallway, lobby, restaurant personel, life guards at the pool etc etc. We live in Thailand are are used to best service but we were still impressed with Atlantis and their attention to their guest. All prices are however too expensive and you get just a normal typical 3-4 star room. Our kids want to go back due to the waterpark - but this place is not really affordable.	
+	May 20 2009 	love the interior	very very impressive hotel made in desert with all newly listed facilities and latest decorative pieces in each and every corners. mind blowing fountains in entrance . excellent hospitality and very very co operative staff . pool side is worth seeing and if you go in upper area by lift ,you can find your self in heaven -- ocean surrounding you n tempting view.rooms were nice but little bit small but if you take view from outside your room , it looks like big cruise mine was ocean view room and i never like to miss any moment .i really appriciate that they do serve breakfast in small silver vessle in proper quantity with best quality and too amny different items . their serving style is praise worthy. their style of spreading bedsheet is different n i love that.cleanliness of all glasses of windows --- i cant explain	
+	Dec 28 2007	Burj Al Arab is really luxury WOW!!	Got a taxi to outside the 7 star Burj Al Arab Hotels (famous new hotel) security gatehouse. I managed to have lunch at Wild Wadi (theme park) before entering Burj Al Arab. I managed to escape from being splashed by the waterfall, to keep my smart clothes dry for posh Burj Al Arab!! The security guard had allowed me to go to Burj Al Arab with my afternoon tea reservation letter. I walked towards Burj Al Arab and went in - WOW, very luxury lobby! I could not believe I met the same Japanese ladies whom I met the day before, during our Sundowner Dune Dinner Safari tour!! We took photos there. We entered the Skyview Bar on the 27th floor for the afternoon tea. The bar staff were very friendly towards us! They allowed us to take photos there! Nice tea, sandwiches, pretty little fancy cakes, etc. I felt full up!! The Japanese ladies left there before 5pm. I stayed on until the dark evening for the night view of Dubai! It was really fantastic! I also took some photos of the luxury fairytale lifts corridors! I went down to the lobby - I liked the colourful carpet. I walked back to the taxi stand outside Wild Wadi (theme park). I know it was very expensive, but it was really worth visiting!	
+	Dec 31 2006 	Unbelievable so much so its ridiculous - We loved it!	Amazing hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If everyone was able to they should stay here once in their lifetime!! It is the ultimate in luxury and you can see why it is currently considered the best hotel in the world. We visited Dubai for 3 days on the way back from Mauriitus where we had just got married. It was my now Husband's dream to stay in this hotel and if you are going to pay to do this once, your honeymoon has to be it! I was actually not too keen on going just because I hate really posh hotels and restaurants - I feel really uncomfortable unlike my confident 'city boy' husband! On arrival you get picked up by a Rolls Royce offered bottled water (which can apparently cost more than petrol in Dubai!!) and offered a choice of 6 CD's of music for the journey to the hotel and then I was handed a bouquet of flowers. On arrival at the hotel you are offered fresh cold towels the minute you enter and then dates. The lobby is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! You will be photographing it at every angle when you get a chance. We were then taken to our suite on the seventh floor introduced to the concierge and butler (and that was just for the 8 or so rooms on our floor!) We were given a wedding cake, wine a ton of local delicacies to enjoy a list of newspapers from around the world we could order for our room, they had thought of everything, infact for the three days we were there we had gifts of perfume, chocolates, wine etc. given to us every day it was unbelievable! As for the suite well it has two floors and is absolutely huge with a beautiful large chandelier above the spiral staircase. There is a plasma screen tv a large seating area, dining table and desk with free internet access from the laptop computer provided. Upstairs you have a huge bed with a mirrored ceiling another big tv and a bathroom to die for!!!! The bathroom is huge and beautifully decorated with big jacuzzi bath and seperate massive shower. Both floors of the suite have floor to ceiling windows giving an amazing view. The remote opens the curtains too!! The windows are darkened so you can see out but people can't see in - except at night when you put the lights on (we did not realise this until we were outside one night).The hotel has a number of places to eat and drink, the Al Mahara restaurant probably being the most popular with its 2 minute pretend submarine ride to get to it and large aquarium. We actually chose not to dine in this restaurant because we are not big fans of seafood but at the Al Muntaha which is at the top of the Burj instead. We had an amazing meal with Wagyu beef (suppposed to be the best in the world where the Japanese actually massage the cows!). It was incredibly posh, not only do you get a wine list but you get a water list to determine which countries bottled water you wanna drink but despite my fear of all things posh I coped - it was worth it!As for everything else - you get free entry to Wild Wadi - which was great and we really enjoyed our day there, there are loads of places to shop, my tip would be to visit the Mall of the Emirates, and definetly take in a tour to learn more about Dubai itself. Taxis are available outside the hotel and are cheap. The beach next to the hotel is beautiful too. In terms of what to wear, for the hotel dress smart its expected and we came prepared for that I also went out and bought a whole new wardrobe of clothes that 'covered me up'. In Dubai because of religion I had read that pretty much you should be covered with no cleavage, or shoulders showing and no short skirts or shorts. This is true in some parts although in the shopping malls there were many female tourists walking around in shorts and vest tops. Obviuosly on the beach and in the water park you can wear bikinis although bear in mind as you leave the hotel you will need to look smart etc. you can't just put a sarong around your bikini and walk down to the beach so take a big bag so you can store your change of clothes! Having said that we were given a big burj al arab bag as a gift from the hotel so we used that.When we booked our holiday they did warn us that there will be building work going on around you. This however is not a problem. Building is going on everywhere - there are supposed to be more cranes in Dubai per square mile than anywhere else in the world! But while you can see it, it does not invade your space or ruin your holiday. Because the hotel is on an island you are distanced from it and certainly don't hear it so I would not worry if your travel agent tells you this. All in all absolutely amazing you will never stay in another hotel like it. It is expensive but for the quality it is to be expected and well worth doing it once. Even if unlike us you have a ton of money and visit expensive hotels all the time I still think this will be the best you will ever stay in!	
+	Sep 28 2004	Arabian magic		
+	Oct 27 2009 	Very good compared to other city hotels we have stayed at	We stayed here for 3 nights two weeks ago. A lovely hotel above the burjuman shopping centre. We arrived at 9am and were given a room straight away. A one bed classic apartment, very spacious. The staff were good and we were looked after.Breakfast was included in our rate at the Gallery, very modern boutique style seating area with a good selection. The kids were pleased to see they actually had kellogs coco pops.A very central location, very good for us but hated by the taxi drivers due to the traffic build up at peak timed. There is a metro station straight outside the shopping mall. Here you can take the train, for about 5-7 dirhams per person you can travel to areas like the mall of emirates which is close to the burj al arab and wild wadi. If you have children, the nearby Zabeel park is a must, lovely gardens and also a space centre (free entry) which will keep the kids occupied for a while. Coming back to the hotel, i would stay here again.	
+	Jun 5 2004	Perfect little Apartments for our stay in Dubai!	The Sofitel Apartments were more than perfect for us. We had a two bedroom, two bath, living room, kitchen area with two balconies. This was more than enough for 2 adults, two children and the maid. Very clean and spacious with modern conveniences and decor. The staff in the lobby should have been friendlier, but they weren't horrible....just stuffy. The Apartments were just like a little home away from home....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 	
+	Mar 27 2009 	Great location huge room but avoid the breakfast	I stayed here for a 3-night stopover. Id never been to Dubai before so i wanted a good location, safe (for a solo female) and clean. The location on the map is wrong - it's on Al-Muteena St (on the south or creek side), about 50 metres from the corner of and Omar Ibn al-Khattab Rd. I arrived at around 10am, and my room was ready! My studio apartment was BIG. I didn't use the kitchen facilities but I had a quick peek in the cupboards, and the main kitchen utensils were there. The bathroom was a bit small, but how big does a bathroom need to be anyway, right? The loo didn't flush properly, but the cleaning crew took care of that on the first day and there were no more problems. A hairdryer appeared in my room within 2 minutes of me requesting it. Wide screen TV with al the main channels. The quiet aircon was great. The check-in staff are friendly, and the security guys and concierges are fabulous - so helpful, and great to chat to about the cricket. I even got my 5.30am wake-up call. It's in the Indian part of town, so lots of restaurants around, and a 24hr convenience store a few doors down. It's a buzzy, lively area and I never felt unsafe, even late at night. Avoid the hotel breakfast at all costs - it took 45 mins to arrive and was cold! It's an easy 20 min walk from the main Deira souk area (Gold, Perfume, Naif etc etc). No probs getting taxis. I think it's good value for money in a very expensive city. I'd stay there again	
	+	Average hotel	The hotel was slightly older than what I was expecting. The interiors are quite dark, and there isn't a lot of light in the common areas. The staff is extremely welcoming, very helpful and kind. At my arrival I discovered my travel agent caused some problems with my reservation, but the receptionists managed to sort everything out. The room was quite spacious, had a nice decor and was provided of all main facilities. In the bathroom I found the best toilestries ever...such a fantastic fragrance!! Breakfast was ok, and I particularly appreciated the big fruit selection. The hotel restaurant isn't excellent, and I preferred to have meals in other city restaurants. After all, despite its 4 stars, this is not the luxury hotel you might be thinking of when thinking about Dubai. But at the same time, I haven't found any reason be unsatisfied.	
+	Jul 9 2009 	Fabulous!	The Crowne Plaza Hotel @ Festival City was quite lovely and the customer service was impeccable. We only stayed there for one night but if we ever return to Dubai we will stay there again. We had the King mini suite and the room and bath were gorgeous and the view was fabulous. The hotel is approximately a 15-20 minute ride from the airport and less than $10 (USD) taxi ride. I would not stay at the Crowne Plaza in old Dubai  old Dubai is seedy (we tried to stroll the gold market but the aggressive shop owners made the experience unbearable). The malls is Dubai are outstanding  but no more so than the upscale malls in the US. The mall connected to the Crowne Plaza is nice but again no more so than shopping in Manhattan or Beverly Hills.Note: I highly recommend that the first thing you do is take the SuperBus city tour (a double decker bus). It has two routes; stops at all the tourist locations and the best thing is you can get off at one of the stops and catch a later bus. They run every 30 minutes. It's a great way to see the &quot;lay of the land&quot; and is more economical than taxi or renting a car.	
+	Feb 14 2006	Fantastic hotel		
+	Jul 5 2009 	Quality location and service all first class	This was our 4th visit to the Madinat Jumeirah hotel and our 3rd time in the villas. As always the whole experience was very good from the minute we arrived to leaving. The Villas with the on hand butler service make doing anything a breeze. I agree with a previous report that the private pool service was not as good as previous years, but it was still good. Everything else was as good as before. The best bit was you were treated like a returning guest, they had done their homework and welcomed you back, which for such a large hotel was really nice.We stayed in villa 11, two minutes to the beach and we were 5 steps from patio to pool!There are 40+ places to eat, this time we decided to try all new restaurants from our previous trips. Pisces was the best, highly recommended and i would also recommend Segreto, both a reason to dress up, good quality food and wine a place for a special treat. We also dined at MJ's which was a decent steak house.The main pool was chilled which in the heat 43degs was required but th private pools were quiet and chilled out. I did a bit of both as people watching around the main pool is an interesting way to while away an hour or two!We will be back	
+	Mar 1 2006	Great stay	Really helpful, friendly staff. Helped every time we entered and departed the hotel. Yummy breakfast. Large, comfortable room. Not the newest building in Dubai but well kept. Helped us organise our trips. New Zealand.	
+	Aug 16 2009 	Not to bad!	When I stayed here it was due to close proximity to my business meetings. I read over some of the reviews here and really don't agree with some of them. This is not the one of the high end hotels where you pay a ton of money per night and not a 5 star. The service is not great and the restaurants borderline terrible (If you ever been to Thailand stay away from the Thai restaurant) but for a reasonable price in Dubai (I had a special) I got what I paid for. Location was good for me too, I enjoyed the recreation facilities (beach, tennis courts, gym). Warning though! When you come outside looking for a taxi the guy in the stand will try to get you take one of the white luxury cars. Do not do it, they are rip off artists. Wait for a regular cab or hail one just on the main road.	
+	Oct 24 2008 	Perfect stopover budget hotel	We have recently returned from our first visit to Dubai, where we spend three nights at the Nova on the recommendation of Trip Advisor contributors. We were looking for something cheap and cheerful to use as a jump point to our onward journey to Europe. The hotel staff were very pleasant and all parts of the hotel were extremely clean. Our room was massive, with a separate anti room and bathroom, however we did not have a window. This was not really a problem as we simply wanted a clean place to stay and the shower was great. Lots of hot water and pressure. We were on the third floor and at the 'back' of the hotel so everything was whisper quiet. This is a budget hotel - however it suited our needs perfectly. The bonus for me was the breakfast. This hotel is in the old part of town ( Indians rather than Arabians), and breakfast reflected this. After the first morning of having hot milk on cornflakes we opted for the Indian - naan bread and three different curries. I was in heaven. My other half had an omelete each morning - individually made with fillings of his choice. Being situated in the old part of Dubai we were able to walk everywhere and were two minutes from the textile souks and a short water taxi (A$ 1) from the gold and spice souks. The hotel is across the road ,almost, from the Dubai Museum, which is definitely worth a visit - spend 1 - 2 hours there.	
+	Apr 5 2007	A Good Experience	i arrived in Dubai for an interview and was booked into the Flora. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was allright, if somewhat expensive. It was a very clean Hotel and the room was large and well laid out. All in all, I would stay there again.	
-	Jun 10 2009 	Horrible service and not a four star hotel by any standards	I booked a room called &quot;comfy room&quot; on the 6th floor of this hotel. I choose this hotel entirely due to the good reviews on trip advisor.First the hotel is in the middle of no where and is situated in a constructin worker housing area with horrible odor of sweat in the airWhen I enterd the hotel there was no one there to take the luggage, I was asked to deposit 500 dollars US ... this seemed very high since usuaully hotels do not ask for 100 dollars or 1 night room cost in advance in case you use services after 5 minuites the bell boy came from his smoke break and took my luggage in. My arrival time was approximatly 9:00 Am. To the best of my understanding and having been to over 15 diffrent hotels across the world the normal check in time is 12:00 PM... this hotel had a 3:00 Pm check in time which meant after a 22 hour flight I could not take a shower or rest, I was told to go to the pool on the roof and take a shower their... I found this very odd and unprofessional of a so called 4 star hotel. the hotel by no means was 4 stars, especially by Dubai Standards of good hotels. I would give this hotel a 3 and thats pushing it. Now regarding the breakfast, I was charged 168 DHS for breakfast while it was actually in my reservations and paid for, I dident pay of course but it was a hassle. The food was not 4 star at all, the fruits were canned and not fresh and the meats were very cold and dry, I am not a picky person but this was very unacceptable. The room it self was good and spacious with the minor issues of bathtub and sinks being dirty. The Air conditoning which you can set your self would turn off in the middle of the night making sleeping very difficult as well. All in all i would not recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure. Before I forget the interent was free only on the lobby floor and was ridiculously slow. The room rate for the internet was the eqivilanet to 15$ per hour which was really suprising given the slow speed of 512 MB per second. I would not suggest this hotel to anyone because it is all just a big headache. I was only at the hotel for 4 days and only spend the time their eating breakfast and sleeping since I was going to business meetings everyday but all in all not a good hotel even for a few hours.	
+	Jul 14 2008 	Great business hotel	I stayed at the hotel for more than 2 weeks for business and there is hardly anything to complain about. The hotel is pretty new, the rooms are large and furnished in a modern style with a pretty large fridge which helps when staying for a longer time. You don't get great views, but if you want sea view, don't book a downtown hotel. The pool is pretty big for a rooftop pool.The gym is also very well equipped and quite large - I've seen many gyms in other hotels which resemble more a homegym, and the aircon was working without any problems now. Finally, breakfast buffet is excellent - with more than just a breakfast selection, which again is good if you are out the full day for business. The only downturn is the lack of experience and understanding of the staff sometimes (e.g. check in, visitors) - it's good to have rules, but it is also good to have some experience that not all rules can followed all the time (e.g. presentation of passport which is currently with the Immigration Department for getting a residency visa). Cleaning staff could also be a bit less noisy at weekends.I have to admit that I stayed during the summer period, which meant great value for money and a rather empty hotel. Otherwise the pool are might get a bit crowded.Internet is rather expensive - but again this is common in these kind of hotels in Dubai.	
+	Apr 11 2009 	Great Hotel good location!	My husband , 6month old baby and I travelled to Dubai for the first time. We booked our hotel based on reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not dissappointed at all. The room was lovely and very big. The location of the hotel was ideal to get to anywhere in Dubai.The staff were EXCELLENT!!!very polite and helpful- Thank you guys!!Never waited for more than a minute to get a taxi as Sheik Zayed Rd is very busy and the staff ensure the driver knows where you are going.	
+	Nov 10 2009 	Excellent value quality and service	This place is as pleasant as my fellow reviewers describe. I stayed here for a weekend in early November and it didn´t feel like soft opening any more, everything was smooth. Reception was always friendly and efficient, as was staff at the door which was always quick to flag down a cab (no problem since major road in front, which is, of course, also a downside). Breakfast was absolutely outstanding with egg station, vast choice, friendly and efficient staff.The lobbly area is well designed, brand-new and spotless (there were 2 employees cleaning when I checked in at 2 a.m.!). There is a business center with free internet. There is also a cable in the rooms (which I did not use since I didn´t bring a computer). I had a single room which wasn´t huge but adequate size. The bed and pillows were quality, as were the bathroom finishings. Large TV. Very pleasant decor (see pix). Complimentary water bottles every day, which is a nice touch.While the area is not nice, the location geographically is smack in the middle: taxi rides (at night admittedly) from and to the airport took a mere 15 minutes, to Jumeirah Beach Park 10-15 min, 15 min to Dubai Mall and I guess the same to the center (where I didn´t go).The only (minor) downsides were: the location itself is totally non-descript, dusty highway with nothing much in the vicinity except the few shops described by previous reviewers; there is absolutely no view from the rooms or the breakfast room; no complimentary shuttles were available (airport, beach, malls, but taxis in dubai are very cheap); the size of the pool. These things would have otherwise caused me to give 4 stars instead of 5, but the excellent opening-rate outweighed this. All in all, it is very good value for money and I recommend staying here.	
+	Jul 25 2007	Fantastic...	We stayed at the Golden Sands 3, while visiting the one and only 10* Dubai. There are about 9 or 10 different blocks of Golden Sands, I think 3 &amp; 5 are the main blocks for tourists.It was a pleasant surprise considering the cheap price tag per night, our room was just a studio, but surprisingly big, with its own kitchen and lounge area. Very clean and maid service every day. The staff were very helpful at reception and taxis waited outside all the time, as the heat is unbearable and you can not walk anymore than 10mins. (very cheap to grab a cab.)We found the excursions we booked were cheaper through the GS3 than a tour operator. We went on the Jeep desert safari which I would highly reccomend you to do, it was mega... All i can say is that Dubai is amazing, there is so much to see and do and if you cant afford to stay at the Burj Al Arab or Jumeriaj Beech resort, the Golden Sands is great, located close to all amenities, even if you do have to get a short cab ride, coz of the heat.Would reccomend you to make a reservation at the Burj Al Arab, it's out of this world...Have a good trip.	
+	May 7 2006	GREAT!!!	There are 11 Golden Sands Hotels all next to each other (#12 in the making) all owned by Arenco who own lots of properties &amp; Hotels in Dubai. We stayed at the Golden Sands 3, our taxi driver told us this is one of the best ones &amp; is also the most popular one. May 1st - May 5th 2006. The rooms are very nice, with sofas, a small dining table &amp; a kitchen area, where you have a fridge freezer, cooker, kettle &amp; even a washing machine. I think all the rooms have a balcony, ours was facing the street (front of the hotel) which could be noisy at times, but we did not mind. The rooms was also air con. The bathroom was small but clean &amp; all white. Also we had an iron &amp; ironing board. There is also a safe in the room in the wardrobe.There is free internet access donstairs in the lobby, there are 2 PCs in the &quot;business centre&quot; &amp; 1 just near the lifts - these can be really slow &amp; sometimes did not work.Also the hotel has an office where you can go &amp; book your tours &amp; outings, you can book the desert safari here also for half the price that you would pay if you pre-booked with Expedia. (Recommended).We only ate lunch twice at the hotel. They offer buffet breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner. We had the buffet lunch the 1st time &amp; the 2nd time we just ordered off the menu as it could get quite boring. Their salad table was pretty nice. This hotel does not have a bar &amp; does not serve any alcohol.Outside in the pool are, the pool is quite small. Not ideal for swimming, but just lazing about or cooling off. There are also sun loungers available but you have to get there pretty early. The hotel does not provide towels for the pool area. Best thing to do is take your room towels then just ask for new towels when you get back to your room.The service here is really good, the staff are always helpful &amp; eager to help, as we had a roblem with one of our excusions &amp; they really went out of their way to help.There are also taxis outide ready to take you where you want to go. A Taxi to Jumerieh Beach is under 40Dh. There are also 2 supermarkets close by (10-min walk in the heat!) Choitram &amp; Sons &amp; also Spinneys.Also would advice make reservations to the Rooftop Bar @ The One&amp;Only Royal Mirage Hotel - this was amazing! Try &amp; get there before sunset.Hope this was helpful.	
+	Oct 10 2009 	Grand Hyatt Dubai	very well decorated hotel with a large lobby and a 'forest' within the centre of the lobby. uniquely designed and comfortable guest rooms.	
+	Dec 20 2006 	Honeymoon	We stayed here for the first 4 days of our honeymoon before moving on to Mauritius for 10 days (see Beau Rivage, Mauritius).The Grand Hyatt was a great hotel. Good location, efficient service, Excellent selection of food for breakfast (ate far too much!).This hotel is geared more to business than honeymooners but I have to say it was better than the last leg of our honeymoon. The staff were efficient, the room clean and tidy everytime we came back after the day, I cannot fault anything. I would recommend it.	
+	Apr 7 2006	Really Good Hotel	We went to Dubai on the 24th of March for a break and have to say that we found this hotel to be very good, The service that we experianced went beyond that which we had expected after reading some of the reports on this site. The Hotel itself is probably the biggest in Dubai.We arrived late after a long flight and followed the instructions given to go to the desk and hand the taxi voucher to them. We were soon in a taxi and on our way to the hotel. It didnt take that long to get there but then again the traffic was light.When we got to the hotel the staff were quick to help unload the taxi and then the front desk dealt with us promptly. Up to our room and the bellboy brought our luggage soon after.The hotel is very clean and laid out internally in a superb manner. Very posh and very modern. The staff were as you would expect from a five star hotel very unobtrusive but there when ever any need was anticipated. My Wife spent time out by the pool and she stated that she had never been treated with such attention at any resort that she had been at before, cucumber for the eyes, cooling spray, nothing was too much trouble. Attracting the attention of staff was never an issue and food and drink orders were dealt with promptly.All in all it was a great hotel. We ate at the Manhattan Grill and the italian and found both of them to give good service and great food. The coffee shop had delicious ice cream and also served great coffee.Dubai was a good destination to go to and enjoyed the souks, the taxis were cheap - in fact very cheap by western standards. We did the river cruise and also went to the Basra Arab(?) for afternoon tea in the observation room - that was excellent but I have to say that I was most disappointed with the service, this was supposedly a high class resort but to recieve a cracked cup beggered belief.I would not hesitate to return to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.	
+	Oct 15 2009 	TOP DRAW	If you want a really great hotel and service at very reasonable Dubai prices, can't be beaten from my experience, I'm critical to say the least, but so few points to be unhappy with, not even worth going into. Stay there, you will not be upset.	
+	Nov 16 2006 	Absolutely Loved It	We have just returned home from a wonderful few days at the Grosvenor Hotel . We had luxury and were treated like royalty.Me and my wife have visited Dubai on numerous occasions but felt this was our best visit .Weboth enjoyed Buddas Bar and Indego was very special. We took some family friends who were blown away with the city and all its splendour.We met a very famous celebrity in Bar 44 . We all would return to Dubai tommorrow given half the chance .One of our friends had sore feet from all the walking but this did not seem to matter . Dubai marina is fab and would like to live there one day.	
+	Mar 30 2006	Fantastic!	What a fantastic place! Staff are extremly friendly and will do anything to make your stay as relaxing and memorable as possibble.There is a shuttle service to the beach (takes about 2 minutes to get there).Rooms are amazing- especially at the front overlooking the sea and it's definitely worth checking out the bar on the 44th floor.	
+	Oct 1 2009 	Overall - No Problems!	Upgraded before arrival to Club Room with sea view &amp; small balcony, room was clean, spacious and well maintained.We arrived at airport about 8am and met by hotel staff, yes two and taken direct to hotel, with commentary en-route, on arrival, as in Club Room we were in our room by 9.30am. Must say all staff were friendly, helpful and professional, a theme that was standard throughout our stay. Despite some areas in hotel looking 'tired' overall no problems with facilities, although poolside could do with a revamp... Sun beds and mattresses poor, running repairs to rickety wheels required on regular basis and availability, although we always managed to get a couple, as mentioned in previous reviews, it certainly seems the 'Early Birds' bagged the best located beds, but not used until mid-afternoon. Used the Club Lounge for breakfast, first class service, wide range of choice and quality, whilst had half-board, main restaurant was acceptable both in food choice and service, on occasions could have been better. Due to Ramadan, access was restricted until after 8pm, but this was not a problem.Visted the on site Thai/Japanese restaurant, which was very good, excellent service and food, perhaps a tadge 'expensive' but hey when you are on holiday.....Hotel is in good location and beachside, okay construction is ongoing, but at present that appears to be happening no matter where you are in Dubai.... For those requiring 'retail therapy' Hotel provided free shuttle buses to and from the major shopping malls, which were well used or taxi's a plenty.Overall, enjoyed our stay, Hotel matched our expectations, which enabled us to have a pleasant &amp; relaxing time.	
+	Apr 28 2009 	Nice location	Very good location. However indian food is not available.	
+	Nov 9 2008 	fits the bill perfectly - good hotel	We stayed at this hotel for part of our honeymoon and (recognising that most reviewers only read the first sentence of any review well cut to the chase) it was very good.For those still readingThe Hilton Dubai Creek is located on the busy Baniyas Road in the Deira district of Dubai but, despite this central location, feels relatively peaceful and almost serene. Like any hotel, it is to be judged by the quality of its staff and the employees at this place are excellent  always there with assistance, information or simply a greeting.The hotel is located a 30 minute walk along the Creek from the centre of Deira and the popular Gold Souk. Its location on the motorway-esque Baniyas Road makes it very easy to get to by taxi from anywhere else in Dubai; taxis being a very cheap and cheerful form of transport in what can be a relatively cash-hungry destination.Inside.the lobby promises much with its chrome-littered walls and marble floors. The Issimo bar on the ground floor is a must for any resident who possesses even a passing interest in good cocktails. On the first floor is THE restaurant in Dubai  Gordon Ramsays Verre. We ate there during our stay and, frankly, cannot recommend it enough.whether youre staying at the hotel or not!! A small and intimate place that is defined, firstly by the excellence of its staff, and secondly by the brilliance of the food. When we ate there the first choice to be made was between the incredibly tempting tasting menu and the extensive a la carte offerings. Either way, youll have no regrets. Needless to say, before reserving your table (which we were told should be at least two weeks in advance) you should be ready to spend in excess of £300 for a meal for two with some decent wine. Whilst convalescing from open-wallet surgery the next day you should head up the creek towards Deira and try the Creekside restaurant opposite the Radisson hotel. What a find!! Mixed kebabs for two with hummus, drinks and a sheesha for about £20  all whilst sitting in the sun beside the water!!The hidden gem for the Hilton is the roof top pool and bar. Cosy and intimate but with a quite magnificent view over the creek and upper Deira. On a clear night you can sit and enjoy your drink whilst surveying almost the entire city, all the way to the silhouettes of the skyscrapers on Sheik Zayed Road and the now-legendary Burj Al Arab hotel. A lovely setting to watch the sun set or drop in for a drink or two before dinner.The room was lovely. Just enough space to feel comfortable but not too much to encourage recklessness!! It was clean, well appointed and nicely furnished. There is an extensive room service menu and all the usual amenities you would expect (decent in-room toiletries, good safe, ample wardrobe space and TV with various UK channels).Our room was inclusive of breakfast which was served in the Glasshouse restaurant on the first floor. All the usual fare (fruit, cereals, croissants, bread...etc..) plus a choice from a variety of cooked options. We loved the Eggs Benedict!The reason for the rather protracted review is due to the number of negative reflections on this hotel on Trip Advisor (some of which concerned us greatly before we left the UK). Of course everyone can have a different experience of the same hotel but, having had an overwhelmingly positive one, we thought we should at least justify our view!!We suppose that, if were going to be pedantic, the potential negative could be price. Whilst the room tariff is reasonable, access to the internet is relatively expensive at approximately £15 for 24 hours. Having visited Thailand and The Maldives where such access is free this was bound to seem excessive but, in fairness, accords with other hotels in Dubai. On the same note, the drinks/food could be regarded as moderately expensive, but again the prices are entirely in line with other hotels/bars in Dubai. For example, expect to spend around £15-£17 on two spirits with mixers and about £4-£5 on a beer.Overall, we wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel to fellow travellers as it properly markets itself as a busy, convenient, city based, large hotel with the service and standards youd expect from a big name. To put it bluntly  it does exactly what it says on the tin.	
-	Jun 28 2008 	Some nice touches but not the best in Dubai	Interesting location - great view of the creek if you are lucky enough to get an exec suite with creek view.Some problems with lack of hot water and flooded bathroom which took a little time to resolve.Nice roof top pool with great views over Dubai.SOme staff very friendly, others have difficulty to understand english.Average exec lounge.Bit of a trek to get to Sheikh Zayet Road, Business centre and Jumeriah beach but very good for the airport.Overall - average score only.	
+	Jun 2 2008 	great stay great hotel	We stayed for just over a week on business and holiday, whilst the hotel is mainly a business hotel it is still a good base for a holiday. Taxi's very cheap and always one there. Room was massive(executive Queen) very clean and kept like that 2-3 times a day.Breakfast was loverly, cold buffet and hot cooked to order. Strange you could order just about all the ingredients of a English b/f but if you wanted all on same plate it cost 95dhs??Ate room service by the pool on roof and once in room on last night very impressive low cost and very nice. Used the laundry service a few times took a few hours and very good and cheap.The pool on roof is smallish but usable and the view is to die for!Staff are great very very helpful from the manager downwards and if you get the chance of an invite to the managers cocktail evening go....food and cocktails lovely.If you go for the executive room book an airport transfer all in with room rate and done very well, we walked out of arrivals 0040 and went to the Hilton man who grabed our bags straight out to waiting limo and in hotel in minutes! Great service.When we next go to Dubai we will be staying here again.	
+	Mar 25 2008 	Hard to beat	We booked this hotel less than 2 weeks before we were due to arrive and we think we got a good deal. (£1,200 for 7 nights in an Executive Suite on the 14th floor. We happened to see another room on a lower floor which looked considerably smaller than ours. We felt that our room was worth the extra cost, but i'm sure that all the rooms are comfortable. Our bathroom/shower was great, and I expect they are all the same). It's more of a business hotel, but this suited us. (If we went again with children we would probably stay at the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah as this is situated on the beach). The hotel runs a free daily shuttle bus to and from the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah where you can use their facilities, however, you have to book your seat in advance with reception. If you don't get a seat, there is a roof top pool which is perfectly fine for catching the sun. (Although, as it is so far up it can get very windy. This didn't do much to cool us down in May, but it did mean that we couldn't keep an umbrella up for long). There are two good shopping malls that are a short taxi ride away. Try not to leave at closing time on a Friday evening though as you will easily wait an hour or more for a taxi. We didn't make any big purchases, but if you're a girl who likes clothes and shoes you can expect to save around 25% on UK prices. The hotel food was lovely!! Due to our room type our breakfast was included and it was served until 11am (I think) which we were pleased about. There was a buffet (fresh fruit, yogurts, cereal, croissants) plus table service (bacon sandwiches, english fried breakfast, eggs benedict). There are two good restaurants (one of which Gordon Ramsey has put his name to) and they weren't too expensive. There is also a bar next to the lobby and a poolside bar which serves food. With regards to service, we couldn't fault it. All staff went out of their way to be polite and helpful.I would definitely stay at this hotel again. (We have compared every hotel that we have stayed in since, and none have matched it).	
+	Feb 4 2008 	Fantastic hotel	Stayed at this hotel for four nights from 30th of Jan, everything about it was brilliant, location was perfect away from all the building work elsewhere in Dubai, staff were very friendly and helpful, we stayed in an executive creek view room which was amazing and allowed you access to the executive lounge which served snacks all day and free drink from 6pm until 8.30 pm. Food in the hotel was very good, breakfasts were superb. Rooftop pool was very nice, small but in January not busy, hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the Hilton on Jumeirah beach and a free complementary taxi back to the airport for guests staying in the executive rooms which are well worth it. The waiter Eric who looks after everybody in the executive lounge was an absolute gem, could not do enough to make the guests stay a very memorable one.	
+	Sep 28 2005	This hotel is the business - quite literally!	Having spent four nights at the Hilton Dubai Creek (Sept 12-16) 2005 I can only say that the experience was very very refreshing. Having come from a family wedding in Karachi, Pakistan, my family decided to visit Dubai on the way back to refresh and replenish and also to find out what all the hype was about regarding Dubai having been there 10 years ago when things were much different.We chose to be picked up from the airport at 11pm when our flight landed by the hotel limousine which in this case turned out to be a Toyota people carrier - albeit a very comfortable one. The very courteous driver immediately offered us plastic containers of ice cold mineral water which was a very thoughtful touch as it was 30 degrees at that time of night. Day temperatures reached 49 degrees. The cost of this transportation is 50 dhirams each way which is about 9 pounds, how ever it should be noted that a taxi would probably charge 10 dhirams (around £2.50)On arrival the receptionist could not find a deluxe plus room that we had booked so upgraded us to an executive room which was very very nice. We had panoramic views of the Creek and the business district, this looks amazing both in the day and at night. The bathroom is awesome, our had a sunken jacuzzi bath and a separate large walk in shower. It all done in black marble with lots of mirrors giving a feeling of openess. Next to the jacuzzi was a clay pot with a candle in it which was lit every evening whilst were out and our beds were turned down, this was all part of the turn down service.The Glass House Restaurant and Gordon Ramsay's Vere seemed a bit pricey and I couldnt see the point as I could always eat in Gordon's London restaurants for the same price so didnt chose to eat there, but give it a go!Breakfast which was included in our tariff was excellent in the Glass House restaurant, the waiters are very attentive. There is a buffet of cold salamis, breads and so on, in addition you can choose from the hot menu e.g. fried eggs, bacon (surprising for a muslim country - but they cater for all) etc.In all I was very pleased with my choice of hotel in Dubai, I am glad I did not stay by the beach. I visited the Hilton Jumeirah Beach Hotel which seems excellent except for the massive amount of building work that is going on right on top of the hotel with huge skyscrapers being erected as part of the &quot;Jumeirah Residence&quot; development, the cranes being used in this work are massive and plentiful!Hilton Dubai Creek - EXCELLENT !!!!!!	
+	Jun 7 2009 	Check in nightmare	The reason why I booked this chain was it offered the best price for its brilliant location. The location was great not only because it was on Jumeriah Beach but also across the road was a street called THE WALK this had numerous restaurants which offered amazing variety and better quality food than the hotel, there is also a supermarket on the upper level. On checking in the hotel swiped my credit card for approximately £456 when I questioned this I was told it was In case I used room service&quot; as you can imagine I was livid because I had not been informed about this and this left me with no use for my credit card for the holiday, I was going to get it back when I checked out but it was the principle of the matter does the credit crunch not mean anything to the Hilton??? To make matters worse I was informed my room was not ready (this is not what you want to hear after a 7 hour flight and its 1am) I had to wait about an hour and even then I was told this was a temporary disabled room and I would be moved the following day, I was not pleased but too tired to argue because it was nearly 2AM by this time. When I eventually got to my temporary room I could not even use the shower as it was too low down and it was fixed so I went to bed feeling grotty.The next morning I went down to reception to see if my room was ready and I was told it would not be ready till after 3pm, as you can imagine I was fuming. I calmed myself down and to make matters worse they did not even offer me anything for the inconvenience so I had to ask! I asked for a free upgrade and I was told they could not do this as fully booked, so I said to staff are you not going to offer me anything? The staff I feel reluctantly gave me free dinner and soft drinks for two at their cheapest buffet restaurant. I told them I was on my honey moon &amp; disappointed in their service. Staff said they would send up a cake as a gift...this did not arrive for another two days and then it only came because I had to go and ask staff again &quot;where is my gift&quot; absolutely ridiculous. The food in their Oceana restaurant was terrible; it was a cheap luke warm buffet with not enough variety.When I eventually got to my permanent room it was of a good standard, nice spacious size, i had booked the deluxe seaview room, the balcony was of a good size and I could see the sea partially the other half of the view was the building site next door where they were bulldozing down a old building, it was noisy but bearable, when you were inside the room you could not hear any noise from the demolition because the balcony doors are soundproofed, thank goodness. The buffet breakfast was nice and had a good variety and staff provided excellent service.Despite the checking in nightmare, it is a good hotel, a bit boring, staff are very helpful and work very hard, the rooms are nice and very clean. I would recommend it to a friend.	
+	Mar 21 2009 	Very Good Hotel	Very good hotel!Very impressive all round service, friendliness, helpfulness and we needed medical assistance from the nurse - both resident nurses excellent care. Very good taxi availability and accessibility. Great advice within hotel on touring local sights.Traveller's tip on diningFood pricey but plenty and variety of nearby eating places to choose from.	
+	Nov 18 2008 	First class	Having had to move from another hotel as a result of poor conditions what a joy it was to arrive at the Hilton. The front desk manager, Damir Kartal, set the tone for our stay. We had a room on the executive floor and it was pleasure all the way. Breakfast in the executive suite, all day light refreshments, afternoon tea and scones, and free alchoholic drinks between 6 and 8 pm . Most rooms have a sea view, the pool area is well laid out there are ample beach beds and first class service is on offer everywhere. Eating is a joy, you can stay a few days and never visit the same restaurant and the food quality is very good. the view across the Jumeirah Palm is wonderful and on the landside the new shopping Mall is almost fully open. The very busy Abu Dhabi Dubai road is very near yet the hotel location is on the beach and it is impossible to hear any traffic noise. Certainly a hotel that provides stunning levels of service and must be on the &quot;we will return list&quot; for many.	
+	Aug 30 2008 	Hilton Dubai Jumeirah	i booked via hilton.co.uk and stayed i king suite its located at the bottom of jumeirah beach near dubai marina hotel has excellent facilities for kids our 4 year old loved the baby pool and kids club hotel is very clean rooms are excellent service was fantastic walk out of the hotel straight to the beach close to emirates shopping mall to try the ski dubai overall excellent stay cant fault the hotel would definetly stay there again	
-	Apr 1 2005	Lovely hotel but not the best on Jumeirah Beach	It is true to say that the overwhelming construction work which surrounds the Hilton complex is a bit of an eye-sore, and my deluxe sea-view room, was a massive disappointment, but the service here is fantastic, and the food of top quality. The hotel boasts several high quality restaurants with cusine ranging from Italian to Mexican. The Thursday night Arabian buffet is a must! Breakfast is also a real event in itself, and the skybar on the top floor is highly recommended for the view. Rooms are of a good size, and are comfortable but not luxurious. The pool and gardens leading to the beach are very pleasant, and you don't relly notice the construction work going on in the background after a while. We did enjoy our short-stay but I doubt we would return, as I am certain there are better 5 star hotels on Jumeirah beach, albeit at a more expensive rate.	
+	Dec 15 2008 	Absolutely Lovely. The staff were ever ready to please	Stayed at the hotel with a female friend from the 4th-9th Dec.We were pleased that the hotel is situated a mere 5mins walk from Mall of the Emirates. Nice design, spacious lobby and welcoming staff. The standard room was a teeny weeny cramped but the decor more than made up for the lack of space. Room service was prompt and food served was filling and delicious. We made sure we tried out most of the menu. Had a good time at the gym with very helpful personal trainers. The downside being it wasnt opened 24hrs. It wouldve been helpful to burn some calories after our midnite feasts. The Thai restaurant on the ground floor serves some seriously tasty green curry. Watch out for the chilli though. The bellboys couldnt do enough for us. Smiling through and helping with our hundredth shopping bag..all within the first day; flagging down taxis for us and generally assisting with any enquiries we may have at any time of the day. Security was pretty good too. Reception called more than twice to ascertain that we are indeed expecting guests. Our room was always very well cleaned out with fresh supplies of towels and toiletries. Ensure you put out the &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign out though, otherwise the shrill noise of the housekeeper ring is bound to rouse u rather abruptly from the warm cocoon of the comfortable bed. All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised with this 4* hotel. In our eyes, it had all 5* quality. Special thankks to Khalid at the Reception, Ken at the Concierge desk. We'll surely visit again.	
-	May 28 2008 	Pay a bit more and get a better Hotel	Stayed there recently while conducting business in Dubai.Lobby - probably 150 sq m2, very basic and not impresiive at all and there is bell serviceOver the counter - not great service but not rude eitherNightclub - one, unable to comment as it was during the month of RamadanCafe - under renovationThere are however, some shops allocated nearby, a laundry, a local coffee shop, a convenient store. Other than that surrounding were serviced apartmens, suites, and other hotels.Lift - one and only, basic and cleanCorridors - very small smell of smoke, with dark coloured carpetsRoom - small, but clean with an empty fridge, very basic not lavishly furnished, furniture still in acceptable qualityBathroom - clean, and very basicBasically did not expect too much at the price that we were paying, but we would want to pay slightly more for a better hotel next time.	
+	Aug 24 2009 	One of the Best Budget Hotels in Dubai	This is a brand new hotel (Opened November 2008), so its clean and shining.The location is great, just across the street of Deira City Center (one of the major malls in Dubai), and its just 5 minutes drive to Dubai airport.The rooms are tiny, good for two people only.Advantages:- Good if you are looking for place to sleep only- Free car parking is availableDisadvantages:- Internet is not free- There is no refrigerator in the room!!- No safe box in the room- No tea/coffe making tray	
+	Sep 28 2009 	comfortable nice and affordable hotel...	second time in dubai, my friend suggest me staying in this hotel coz its affordable.. and its true.. well as we went inside, the lobby was so quiet coz its evening already at past 10pm. the receptionist was attentive and always smiling. Cant believe it was so easy to check-in unlike some luxury hotels. Me and my wife was so tired that time and ask for room service, and unfortunately, they dont have that kind of service. Reason? no idea. Its good thing that the lobby restaurant was still open for some last minute order. Wine is fine, but I hope the staff knows if its dry bodied or medium. And my favorite mexican style beer, they cant make it nice.. Cant find the true taste of what they made. First time mexican beer with a slice of lime inside the beer. Complaint about it but still they cannot make it right when it was so simple.As we went for our room, shock coz it was so small but it was fine. Staying there for 2 nights is fine. Although there is a problem with the bathroom coz the door in the shower area was leaking and need to use a towel inside the bathroom or else u will be slipped. They should try another alternative for that soon.Rest of our stay was great i may say..	
+	Oct 21 2007 	Schrecklich altmodisches Hotel gehen dort nie mehr hin!!		
+	Apr 7 2005	Best Hotel we stayed in Dubai		
+	Sep 20 2009 	A fantastic family holiday!	We travelled to JBH in July with four children aged between 10 and 16. Having visited the hotel in 2002 without children we were slightly apprehensive about revisiting the hotel again in case it fell below our expectations. However, we needn't have worried. The hotel was still as beautiful and the service as good as it was in 2002. After careful consideration we upgraded to Ocean Premium Leisure Club rooms (booked before departure - we could get free drinks in the lounge during the day and go in for Afternoon Tea from 3-5pm. We never actually made the evening drinks at 7pm as we were completely full by then!). After a long night flight we arrrived at the hotel at around 9.00am. At check in we were escorted to the Premium Leisure Club lounge for a more personal check in and were able to help ourselves to the breakfast buffet. Only one room was available, but the view was a little disappointing so we turned it down and decided to make use of the pool and facilities while we waited for rooms to become available. The breakfast buffet selection was amazing and we never had to wait too long to be seated. Our children could not believe the range of food available and enjoyed going backwards and forwards and trying different things. After breakfast most days we took advantage of the early (free) entry to Wild Wadi Water Park. An hour or two was long enough for us to enjoy the rides before returning to the hotel pool. There were lifeguards everywhere - and they actually seemed to quite like children too!When the heat got too much for us we explored the shopping malls. Although the shops are much the same as in England the indoor ski slope and aquarium made these trips more interesting for the children. We travelled to and fro in a 6 seater taxi which we found incredibly cheap.All in all, we had an amazing holiday. Our 16 year olds never complained of being bored and completely appreciated all the small luxurious touches like Godiva chocolates on their pillows at bedtime and a plentiful supply of toiletries in the bathroom. The staff were all friendly especially the poor cleaner on our floor who had to deal with an extremely messy teenagers room. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and family and can't wait to go back there one day.	
+	Aug 23 2009 	You must stay here.	Nothing was to much trouble for the very friendly staff or this hotel. The rooms (Club Level) match or better any in 5-6 star across the globe. The facility's are exceptional and clean. The buggy pick ups and drop offs to any location across the site make for a pleasurable stay. The &quot;Wild Wadi&quot; water park next door with free access from the hotel, is not to be missed. Food at breakfast is amazing with plenty of different spots to try each day, take a room package which includes this facility. The Irish pub inside the complex is good for a late night drink. Well done to all the staff.	
+	Sep 10 2008 	dubayan	This was our second stay at this hotel and just as good as the first, the standard of customer service is second to none.Breakfasts are excellent, a superb range to choose from and all well prepared and cooked.Our son and his friend enjoyed the Segway and Wild Wadi within the hotel grounds, we also visited the Burj Al Arab which is just accross the causeway, with complimentary golf buggy transportation.If you like skiing take a look ar Ski Dubai in the Emirates Mall, great fun.The beach is excellent, again the staff look after you in exemplorary fashion, my wife enjoyed the complimentary ice lollies when the going got hot and on our last day, after checking out we had full use of the hotel facilities until late in the evening.Really excellent value, we booked through British Airways and hired a car fron National Car Hire in advance.	
+	Oct 2 2007 	So much to do at Jumeirah Beach	Brilliant experience and absolutely loved the wild wadi water park. Only here for 3 nights and we want to go back for a week!! Staff were suberp, attentive and so friendly and made so much difference, food was excellent and lots of choice which was brilliant. Many things to do besides the water park, and enjoyed early morning swims in the lap pool with noone else there. It was extremely hot and there were nice little extras like a delivery of ice lollies round the pool and the 'opportunity' to be sprayed with cold water should you wish. Excellent bus services to the local malls, really quite regular but taxis are reasonable if the bus time is not quite right.Went to the Burj al Arab for a visit which is a very worthwhile trip and even better if you manage to get there on a day when there is no haze!!!	
+	May 5 2007 	THE most spectacular location view and hotel	Stayed at this magnificent Hotel in November 2005 with my Mum on the way to Egypt from Australia. The facilities were just fantastic. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Bathroom with a bath and seperate shower. Free internet. We were lucky enough to have a room with a balcony. I recommend you request one when you book. The staff especially the conciege were always willing to assist us with tour bookings or have a chat about what we planned to do or what we had done.We had breakfast every morning at Beachcombers overlooking the white sand, the Arabian Sea and the truly magnificent Burg al Arab Hotel. Such an amazing building no matter what time of the day or night it mesmerises you. It is forever changing with the rising and going down of the sun.Swimming in the Arabian Sea under the Burg al Arab was wonderful as was swimming in the huge pool and treating ourselves to a cocktail at the swim up bar.We took a trip in the desert by 4 wheel drive with a tour and had dinner in a bedowin camp. A great night, great food and great company with tourists from all over the world. Flushing toilets too!!! The only thing I would say is that the belly dancing went on a bit long. At the end of the night they turned all the lights off and we all laid down to view the stars. Amazingly we observed a shooting star in a sky that was black with bright stars all over it! Breathtaking!I would recommend Jumeirah Beach Hotel to anyone wanting a luxurrious and special place to stay out of the heart of Dubai city but well within reach of it by cab. It is quite pricey but if you can splurge you will never regret it. Remember we only live once and this is a once in a lifetime luxury you just can't miss!Loved Dubai! Can't wait to go back.	
-	Aug 3 2009 	Not special	I had read a lot of positive reviews about Le Meridien hotel before we went so I had very high expectations. Unfortunately the hotel did not meet my expectations. A lot of the reviews mention the complimentaty transfer from airport to hotel but this has now become chargeable (even though the journey is around 2 mins). It's cheaper to take a taxi.We had arrived quite early in the morning (7am) and our rooms were not ready. The check-in staff were not overly helpful in suggesting what hotel services we could use to pass the time until our rooms were ready. I recalled from some reviews that there was a shopping centre shuttle service from the hotel and when I enquired about this I was told to wait in the lounge area and that I would be notified when the shuttle arrives. After waiting for about 1 hour (there were 2 young children with us so it wasn't easy) I went to check on the bus and was told that it had already come and gone. I wasn't very happy.Other than that, the rooms were nice and clean although the bathrooms were exceptionally small. We were supposed to get a daily newspaper but this only came on 1 of the 6 days we stayed there, even though I had requested it specifically.I would only recommend this hotel if you are using it as a stoppover for 1 night as it is so close to the airport. Otherwise, there are much nicer hotels to stay in.	
+	Jul 8 2009 	Fantastic And Friendly Service - Best Value Four Star Hotel In Dubai!	Undoubtedly the best value for money four star hotel anywhere in Dubai. A prompt air port pick-up, smooth check in with efficient and helpful reception staff immediately gave us a good feeling that here was a hotel where the entire staff really do go that extra mile to make you feel at home from the moment you walk into the foyer. The room was more than spacious enough, tastefully furnished throughout, a large bathroom with Jacuzzi type bath.in fact everything we needed, or was ever likely to need, was in place down to the smallest items. The breakfast restaurant was located on the pool side with a modern vibrant theme and the breakfast itself was excellent with a wide varied selection of hot and cold dishes, fruits, juices and a never ending supply of tea or coffeeagain the staff where ever attentive, efficient and friendly. The Greek restaurant is a must to visit, the food was superb and good value.. each time we dined there it was always busy, usually with Greek expats so the food must have been authentic!The last mention must go to the Music Room, the large down stairs live music venue which besides having one of the best rock bands wed heard in a long time, the Rock Spiders of Philippines origin, it again offers a great selection of European and Asian foods at reasonable prices. For those who like to shoot a game of pool there is a separate upper tier pool area that does not interfere with those people who wish to relax listening to the music.yet again Rajeev and his staff cannot be thanked enough for their excellent service. All in all, I can honestly say that we would not hesitate to recommend the Majestic Towers Hotel to anyone staying in Dubai. A bad choice in hotel can either make or break your holiday and without a doubt the Majestic Towers Hotel and its extra helpful and friendly staff made our stay in Dubai a memorable one and we will most certainly stay there again on our next visit to Dubai!	
+	May 14 2005	Nice	Service was great. Clean rooms. Great transport / shuttle to &amp; from popular locations. Buffet breakfast was fantastic. Walking distance to restaurants. Just becareful if you are a single female traveller, you could be mistaken for a prostitute walking the streets ... terrible but true unfortunatley.	
+	Nov 21 2009 	Serious bargain during soft launch	I stayed at the brand new Media One for 3 nights in November. The staff were very friendly and eager to please although still getting to grips with this brand new hotel. At the time of my visit only the Med Restaurant (8th floor) and lobby coffee shop were open so food choices were a little restricted but certainly not a problem for 3 nights. I believe the bar was opening on the day I departed (great timing!). The lobby is very open, light and airy with a few shops and lots of staff on hand to meet and greet. My room on the 19th floor was adequately sized for one person: by no means cramped but if you want more space, then be prepared to pay more. All brand new of course, so spotlessly clean, crisp linen and fluffy towels. Exactly what's needed when you're away from home.Flat screen TV with more than 60 channels and free wired internet (still working on the wi-fi, but it's coming).All in all, a first rate place to stay if your business is in Media City or Internet City. One tip if you're visiting in the next few weeks? Get a careful note, or print a map of the location - most airport taxi drivers don't know where it is yet!Let's just hope the prices don't become too outrageous after the soft launch is over.	
-	Nov 4 2008	Very Basic	I've actually stayed at the Metropolitan Deira a few times. Each time, I've had some sort of hassle with the staff. I'm pretty easy to please, so this is unusual. But it's one of the cheapest yet decent places in Dubai so I kept going back. Here were my problems.1. First time I checked in (11:30pm after a long flight) they said they'd &quot;misplaced&quot; my reservation. They left me sitting in the lobby for over an hour. They told me they were going to send me to their sister hotel. Then they managed to &quot;find&quot; an available room. That room was there the entire time. Never got an apology.2. The second time I stayed there I arrived a couple of hours before the official check in. I made sure I'd informed them I'd be requiring an early check in and they'd told me no problem. When I showed up, they said they'd have to charge me for an extra day. Why hadn't they told me this when I'd informed them earlier? They told me to have a seat in the lobby and they'd look into it. Finally, after an hour I asked what was happening. They said they hadn't yet looked into it! They just left me sitting there. I paid extra for the room and they sent me a complimentary fruit basket.3. The third - and final - time I stayed there was this past August. When I returned to my room from some meetings, I found that all the business receipts I'd had organized on the desk were gone. I got the housekeeper and he said he'd thrown them away - as though this was perfectly natural. I'd been traveling throughout Asia and it was all my receipts plus some warrenties for office equipment I had purchased. All of them were gone! Maybe you throw away a banana peel, but unless it's in the bin you don't throw away a guest's paperwork! I complained to management and was told if my papers were important they should have been kept in the room safe. Pretty insufficient response in my opinion. I'd like to meet the business person who locks up their receipts every night.I won't be staying there again. But if you need a cheap, clean room and don't think you'll require ANY customer service, then feel free to stay there.	
+	Sep 21 2009 	Out of this world!	The trip didn't get off to a good start - an overenthusiastic receptionist and a reservations misunderstanding resulted in us having to wait hours for our rooms. However, having reported the problem to the Duty Manager (Nicole) and Manager (Mahmoud), the problems were resolved and from then on, everything was perfect. Thank you Nicole and Mahmoud for resolving the intial issues and going above and beyond thereafter.Pros - customer service is as good as anywhere we've stayed, including 5* hotels in London, Europe, US and Asia; the rooms are great - Arabian rooms with their view of Wild Wadi and the Burj (some road noise in the night) and Ocean rooms with their view of the ocean and the Burj. Half board package gave us a choice of 4 restaurants and the food was superb. Resort is outstanding - buggies to get you around externally, abras to get you around internally. THE best gym and leisure complex. Beach has everything you need for a chill out. No building work anywhere near the hotel, unlike the rest of Dubai.Cons - not many! Drinks expensive, but it is a 5* resort and this is Dubai; sometimes difficult to get an Abra from the Mina station because it is not manned in the night, room service requests not always acted upon when they are busy.Other pointers - visit the Al Qasr next door for a buffet dinner, different atmosphere and nice change. Use your free entry to Wild Wadi - it's a lot of fun; shuttle bus to the Mall of the Emirates lets you connect with the metro, although not many stations open at present. Taxi to airport should be less than 60AED on the meter, more going the other way because of the initial 20AED airport charge. Visit the Burj in the morning and get the panoramic lift to the 27th floor, get the other panoramic lift back down and you'll have had great views of the Palm and the World.We will definitely be going back to the Mina.	
+	Jul 4 2009 	Still Good but the standard is starting to slip	Last stay was three years ago and this time we had the same room type Premiere Leisure Clubroom. Noticed that the rooms are looking a bit used with scratched tables, and walls. Also a strange smell in the room.The afternoon and evening snacks/canapes are also not the quality or the choice that they used to be. The waiting service especially from Chan was however excellent..We were amazed however to see senior managers in black suites checking everyday to see that everything was OK, but choosing to ignore the fact the the tables and storage area for the staff to put empty/dirty cutlery was absolutely dirty and covered in bird droppings. We watched them walk past it every day. The area in question is where you open the doors to go out into the outside area on the right hand side.Otherwise everything OK and still very well trained staff and lots of smiles. The hotel will however need to improve again to survive in a city where the competition is definitely not sleeping	
-	Jun 14 2009 	Great holiday but Dubai is disappointing	The Dubai area is full of building work but now has a feeling of being deserted. The hotel was half full, which is a good thing I guess, but also the service was half working most of the time.The food was sometimes exceptional and sometimes below average and one had no way of telling when it would be bad ... a little unreliable .Breakfast was superb.The rooms were very good but we felt that for the price we were paying we would be getting more spacious rooms. The view was also non existent...facing a wall with plantsWe are not really planning to return.	
+	Sep 20 2008 	5 stars location but that's about it...	This is my 4th stay at the Movenpick Hotel, as part of my biz travel. Whilst Movenpick is classified as a 5 stars hotel, the quality, room size and services are quite questionable. Sure the foyer is grand with a set of grand staircase, backed by the baby grand and grand atrium, I am afraid that's about all the grands you'd get to see. Room sizes is like pot luck - if you are lucky, you get to be placed in a reasonable size room; otherwise, it's nothing like a dog-box. Room quality is another issue - If you happened to be a smoker, congrats cos you get to be placed in the newly constructed rooms; and if you are a non-smoker, you get the old rooms. Room feature is pretty average - TV channels does not correspond to the guide; not to mention the TV signal is pretty average, hence some channel is grainy and voice are faint on othersHotel feature is below average - The pool is tiny and tastes like chlorine; I could not find the running track that the hotel promos; and the internet connection costs a bomb!; To this date, I still don't have any idea what is the purpose of the &quot;try-hard&quot; Japanese theme garden, it's dirty and covered in dirt!Services - Don't expect the reception desk to be much of a help and don't expect any smile either; having other people pushing in doesn't helpNoise - Do not stay on weekends unless you enjoy thumping music whilst you try to sleep. The music coming from the nightclub is sooooo loud that it can easily be heard through the paperthin walls. During the day, you have to put up with the construction noise...Despite all of the above-mentioned, Movenpick is located in a great location that is only 10mins from the airport and walking distance to the Wifi Mall, Ramsey Mall and the nearby restaurants	
+	Jan 30 2009 	bon hotel à côté du centre ancien		
+	Oct 1 2007 	Not your average Novotel!	I stayed at this hotel for four nights in late September. The hotel offers a free shuttle from the airport.Expecting average Novotel fayre, I was amazed to feel the luxury as soon as I walked into the foyer upon arrival. Check in was handled fast and my room preference was honoured in full (low floor, non smoking). The room was excellent, very clean and a real new feeling about it (see photo's). Only slight downside is that I did have one or two technical difficulties. Firstly the Air Conditioning broke down but it was fixed within two hours. Secondly the in-room safe also broke down and was never fixed despite me repeatedly asking. Television channels cater for just about everyone - imagine travelling all that way from the UK to watch Midsomer Murders and Londons Burning!Leisure facilities consisted of outdoor pool and indoor gym as well as steam room. All were of a high standard and maintained spotlessly clean.Breakfast was included in my deal and trust me when I say you can get just about anything - if you don't see it, just ask the chef and he'll make it.Overall, top marks to one of the very best Novotel's I have ever stayed in.	
+	Aug 17 2008	Fantastic place to stay	Stayed at the Oasis beach towers (apartments) it was great! the apartment itself was spacious with a gorgeous view of the beach. The staff friendly, and were there on time to clean the place.The rooms were big, each with big en-suites.The room service food wasnt great, but next to the apartments on the marina walk theres a shopping complex which has places like Subway which delivers 24/7 for free.Free shuttle buses are included and are bang on time.The pools were very nice, quite quiet and its spacious there too. There were 3 pools for the oasis towers and 2 for the hotel. The beach area was pleasant and big and not too crowded.The hotel itself is not close to the city centre, but with taxis and limousines waiting outside at all times it is not a hassle to get there.Would definitely recommend	
+	Jun 22 2008 	Better than we remembered	This is the second time we have stayed at the One &amp; Only and this time was just as good as the last. On arrival we got upgraged to a suite which was a fabulous surprise.I would recomend spending your days at the beach rather than round the pool. The beach is much quieter and the beds are spaced out so you do not feel you are on top of the people next you. This hotel still has the nice little touches of staff coming round the beach to fill up your water glassed, offer fresh fruit and 'clean your sunglasses'.The food was great completely faultless. I would recommend this hotel for a splash of luxury.	
+	Aug 25 2007 	First class service	This is the first time I stay in an O&amp;O hotel, until now our favourite hotels are Four Seasons. So my expectations are high and I must say that I am not disappointed.We arrive at the resort in the early morning (around 7 am), after a night flight from Seychelles. After 10 minutes of check-in formalities, we are offered the choice either to take breakfast or to go immediately to our room which is already prepared and waiting for us. What a pleasure to see that the hotel has noticed our early arrival (I use the hotel transfer service) and organised things accordingly, without us having to ask. From this very moment and until our departure 3 days later, the service always stays at the top level, with attention to every detail. All the staff we meet, no exception, are friendly and helpful. I booked a Prestige room and get a very spacious and well furnished room on the ground floor, which is quite convenient as you can walk directly from the terrace to the nearby pool and beach. Dubai is very hot in summer (35 to 41°C during my stay) so I used to go to the pool in the morning, before taking breakfast. The water in the pool is cooled down and its temperature is controlled (it is lower than the temperature of the sea, and hence quite refreshing). Pool service is impeccable, you can even ask to have your gazebo booked in advance.The only restaurant of Residence &amp; Spa, named The Dining Room, serves excellent gourmet food and we love its felted / quiet ambiance compared to other restaurants in the resort (at the Palace and the Arabian Court).My wife has tried the Givenchy Spa but she is not impressed. Myself, Im delighted with my experience at the Oriental Hammam, especially with the Royal Hammam treatment  a 80 minutes mix of bath, steam room, body scrub, body and facial wrap and massage.All in all, we are very happy with our stay in Dubai at the Residence &amp; Spa. Dubai is not properly a holiday destination, we find it more like a Singapore or Hong Kong of the Middle East. But it is a very convenient and pleasant stopover on the way back from places like Seychelles, Mauritius or Maldives. And the Residence &amp; Spa is one the rare (may be the only one ?) luxury boutique hotel in this city of all superlatives.	
+	Jan 25 2006	great hotel but what a view...	Really, really great hotel, staff, rooms and food. Excellent, superb. Better then I'd ever visited. But what a waste of the view from the beach. Do not expect to have a nice long strech of horizon. Because right in front of you a Palm island is being constructed. Although the building does not affect you in anyway, the view is terribly spoiled.	
+	Jul 9 2005	No Complaints	I stayed in the palm beach rotana hotel for 2 nights in early july 05. Taxi from airport cost 40 diram(less than 10 euro) but on arrival i was a little surprised to find a nightclub next to the hotel and another one inside. I was taken aback at the popularity of these night clubs on a thursday night and it wasn't till the next day i figured out thursday night in islamic countries is a bit like saturday night in the west. Our ensuite room was clean and spacious and had a TV and Irish/English type plug sockets. The hotel faces onto Kalid Bin Walid street which is locally known as the computer street and there was some noise coming in from outside. Our stay cost 456diram in total which worked out at about 27 euro per person per night. Overall it was satisfactory and i have no complaints	
+	Jan 27 2009 	Surprisingly special; classy Dubai hotel	This was not one of the 'recommended' hotels that my well travelled friends suggested but we stayed here anyhow as we were just 'passing by' Dubai and didn't feel like splurging on the more expensive hotels there. Moreover, we find that the Park Hyatt's achieve a nice balance between offering a consistently good-looking hotel without being dull, and for those who like staying at 5-star hotels, it's relatively affordable.Even though we had a very short stay (just 2 days), this hotel definitely 'surprised on the upside' with some points worth pointing out.- The food is fabulous, even for Dubai standards, which already features excellent food. We ate only at Cafe Arabesque -- for breakfast and lunch -- and they are able to offer a wide range of food, all done extremely well. We also ate at Michelin star restaurants at other hotels but our favorite is still this hotel 'coffee shop,' amazingly.- The hotel is very tastefully done, if this is what you care for -- and in Dubai, you definitely get a range of styles -- we also visited the Atlantis, which was quite a (shocking) eye-opener. The Park Hyatt is like an oasis within a city -- like the Sukhothai in Bangkok.- The staff is really very friendly and somehow, and for what's it's worth, the housekeeping is very meticulous and tidy. (I'm just noticing this as we're at the W Hotel Maldives right now with housekeeping that doesn't bother to wipe the crumbs off our coffee tables and forget to re-fill toilet paper.)The main shortcoming: the hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport but 20-30 minutes from the main parts of the city, where most of the 'action' is -- so this may or may not be what you are looking for.	
+	Aug 3 2008 	Fantastic Hyatt on the creek	A great 5 star hotel. On of the nicest hotels and location in Dubai.Sits on the creek and aside the Creek Golf course..a lovely courseGreat rooms, views and easy access to everything. Good restaurants in the hotel and no end of good restaurants all across Dubai.	
+	Sep 15 2005	Enjoyed our stay	Had a pleasant stay at the apartment. The apartment was spacious, kept clean, service was excellent and accessible to all sites. Good value for money.	
+	Sep 21 2008 	Excellent Hotel	A wonderful hotel in the heart of Dubai. The Radisson SAS hotel was absolutely fantastic. The staff are wonderful and the facilities are great. It is located in the heart of the Diera district, with great connections to the Souks and Bur Dubai. The rooms were spacious, clean and with great views of the creek. The restaurants are also fantastic. The Italian and Chinese/Thai were by far the best!If you're looking for a hotel in the city with some personality and good facilities....I'd definitely recommend it!	
+	Oct 26 2009 	Decent stay	Accompanied husband on his business trip and stayed at The Radisson Residence on Dubai Marina for 7 nights. Upon check-in, we were kindly upgraded from a studio to a one-bedroom apartment which was really nice for a week-long trip. The room interior is generally modern with 2 LCDs and comfortable sofa and chairs. The room temperature was perfect for a boiling day as well as throughout the night. The kitchen area was handy as we prepared our own breakfast since we figured that the 70 AED hotel breakfast was not worth it. The bathroom was fine, floor always got a little wet and messy though after shower and there wasn't much space around the sink for me to lay my bottles. Internet was complimentary throughout the stay but connection was rather on a slow side. We had mixed feelings about service here. Some staff were extremely friendly and helpful but some other times, we were served by some very cold and pretentious ones. When I asked for directions, they simply said &quot;we don't know&quot; and when I wanted to find out about something, they just gave me a phone to dial myself and said &quot;sorry we're busy&quot;. I found that totally unacceptable and not something I would expect in a hotel of this class. Other than that, I particularly liked the shuttle bus service provided by the hotel so I can hop on and off the malls, although the pick up time wasn't terribly convenient. For a serviced apartment standard, the Radisson certainly lived up to my expectation. Facilities wise, nothing to write home about - tiny pool and gym areas for ladies and there was only one Thai restaurant in a whole building. Marina walk does provide plenty of eateries, so we weren't out of choice. If you want somewhere to stay near the Internet City, Media City, Marina and not fussed about facilities and service, this is a suitable accommodation. However, if you are after a full-scale beach holiday with four or five restaurants and gigantic outdoor pool, this is definitely not a place to book. With an upgrade, we had quite a value for money stay.	
+	Jul 4 2006	Nice hotel - shame about the staff	We had prepaid accommodation in two triple rooms/one twin including return airport transfers. Airport transfer on arrival was fine but when we came to leave the Front Desk staff tried to charge us. After much battling, they finally backed down albeit reluctantly. Ended up with three twin rooms which meant the two extra children had to share a bed with the adults. Not too ugly as they were small kids and the beds were king size but we had booked triples...English Pub in the hotel does excellent meals which are enormous and great value. Remember if in Dubai on a Friday nothing opens before 1600hours - which we did not know. Easy to get around and good location. Pool was small but sufficient but very hot - not particularly refreshing but the kids didn't mind. Small but sufficient gym. Front Desk Staff need a lesson in manners. Breakfast was excellent.	
+	Apr 23 2007 	Ideal Place	First of all ,first things first. In reply to all those negative comments and moans from previous posters, all i can suggest is that you dig a bit deeper in your pocket and spend some more money if it,s a top class hotel your looking for.Spent a week here in April and although it,s only a 3 star it makes up for it in 5 star service.From the bell boys to the hotel taxi drivers, they couldn,t be more helpful (can organize trips etc. for a decent price ).Right beside the beach which has police presence/life guard on duty and sunbed rental, there are also 2 refreshment kiosks, yes it it close to dubai dock area but not too distracting.(Go other side of promenade)Location of hotel means that a taxi to city sights i.e. gold souks / markets / sail on the creek etc. work out about 3 pounds sterling each way, opposite direction takes you straight down the beach road to other attractions (wild wadi / mall of emirates / madinet etc. ) work out a price with your driver, maybe 5 pounds .Hotel itself very clean and tidy , room cleaned every day, b/fast bar ok (omlettes made to order) internet access in reception and airport pick up can be organised. (our flight was over 1 hr late got in around 11.30 p.m. &amp; still got welcomed with smiling face by driver.) Eating in the hotel could be quite expensive but only in line with other hotel eateries.Various shopping malls within 5-10 min. walk all with big range of cafes.one of the best is Tony,s New York Deli in the Village mall. Also McDonald,s right across the road for those on a bad diet.Could ramble on but can,t say enough good things about this place .For those not too bothered about 5 star hotels , suggest you try here ,unlikely to be disappointed.	
+	Apr 26 2009 	Good Hotel	It is good hotel, centrally located in Karama (Dubai) approx 30 min from airport. They provide visa services, i.e. if you book room, via email they get us visa within 4-5 working days and they charge on credt card. Its so flexible to get UAE visa sitting in on your own office. They provide airport pickup &amp; drop. There are two bars and two restaurants. Rooms are comfortable, need to buy internet connection. Breakfast - Indian veg. options are available in this hotel. It is near to a big shopping mall and they do have city site seening service every day in the morning.Across the road and behind the hotel, there are several good quality Indian restaurants (walking distance) in addition to hotel food option. Per night it was about 500 Dirhams, which might have gone down in this downturn. For visa service, they take 700 Dirhams per person.	
+	Oct 7 2008 	Does what it says on the tin	Visited the Rimal Rotana for just one night after staying at the Grand Hyatt. The RR was clean and functional and the staff were very friendly and efficient. It is a good value for money place to stay in Dubai and situated conveniently in Deira and very close to the airport and souks.The rooms are large with small kitchen area and modestly decorated as befits the price you pay.Certainly to be recommended for a cost effective stay.	
+	May 10 2006 	Very comfortable		
+	Mar 25 2006	Friendly convenient Rolla	Our stay in February, 2006 at the Rolla Residence, Bur Dubai, was made very pleasant by the very friendly and helpful staff,they were well trained and well presented. Our studio apartment was well appointed, clean and very well serviced.The residence is well postioned for shopping, restaurants and places of interest.Public transport clean, air-conditioned and inexpensive.	
+	May 13 2009	Rose Garden Hotel Apartments Barsha Dubai	The location is great, 5 minutes from the Mall of the Emirates. The hotel is clean, facilities are good and the staff are friendly. The rooftop swimming pool was out of order at the start of our stay but is now open again. The only downside to this great place is the construction behind the hotel! The workers have set up camp below the balconies and in the morning (7am), start loading scaffolding onto trucks. Then the hammerdrills start! There is no soundproofing, the noise shakes the room. We tried to move rooms but couldn't get away from the noise unless you took an internal room next to the lifts. Once the construction ends this will be a fantastic hotel, until then, unless you're an early riser I'd be cautious.	
-	Feb 28 2006	Good Price but a bit out of the action	There was a compulsory airport 'meet and greet' fee for this hotel. I was met inside the arrivals hall and handed welcome pack and a map of the terminal with a line indicating the route I should take, a bit like a treasure hunt with all the clues. The map wasn't really necessary because airport was very well laid out, but welcome anyway. I was welcomed again as soon as I arrived at the tour desk, and immediately escorted to a car where I was the only passenger and taken straight to the hotel, which was a big relief. Reception was impeccable, even though I arrived quite early in the morning, and I was taken straight to my room, although it was several hours before check in. The staff generally were a bit stiff and over formal for my taste but very, very polite. The tour company used by the hotel also provided a representative in the hotel lounge later that day who was very helpful giving information about various tours, she also telephoned another hotel to tie up the details of my booking for afternoon tea.The room was excellent, spacious, overlooking the roundabout with two double beds massive wardrobe plenty of storage space, tv cabinet with doors over the tv and tea making. The bathroom was spacious and well appointed too, with good toiletries including comb, repair kit etc. The only drawback was that they didnt supply milk on the tea tray, only cream - but hey! isnt that what room service is for?I wasnt too happy with the catering. The buffet breakfast was OK but below average for choice. As a single traveller I found the large tour groups a bit daunting, and found myself feeling very daunted and isolated each morning sharing a table with a group of people non of whom spoke English and grabbed all the service. I found it very difficult to get more tea, and noticed that other English tourists were having the same problem. I waited so long for a refill that a member of staff came over to enquire whether I was all right. I only had one other meal in the hotel, which was room service. It looked OK but wasnt cooked enough.It is worth exploring the area around the hotel which didnt seem very touristy. There are lots of shops and restaurants, including a very nice looking vegetarian restaurant quite close by. There were always taxis to be had outside the hotel which were inexpensive and plentiful if you want to explore further afield. The only drawback is, if you only have a short time in Dubai, and you want to explore the old city, then the traffic and jams can be horrendous something like trying to travel from Chiswick to Hyde Park Corner in the rush hour. I would stay in this hotel again, but another time I would prefer to stay in or around the old city and tourist areas. It would be a good area for business travellers.	
+	Mar 2 2008	Cheap and Cheerful	Not one of the most luxurious hotels in dubai but it does provide cheap accommodation.The hotel is mainly for russians and i'm not sure if the breakfast was centred on this or it was more of a local cuisne, it was pretty strange nevertheless!The room was clean and comfortable enough and the air conditioning worked a treat. You need to put the water heater on before you want to have a shower though, i had a cold shower because i hadn't realised straightaway.The pool area is on the roof and is pretty small. There are only 4 sun beds. We managed to get one every day evenutally but not many people were using the pool during our stay. The water is freezing!An importnant note inline with the other reviews, don't underestimate the problems you will face getting a cab! I had read the other reviews but didnt think it would be much of a problem because i have been to dubai before and been followed down the road by cabs. Apparently it is a real problem though, cab drivers dont want to pick people up in busy areas. We aited an hour for a cab the first night, we actually flagged down 5 or 6 and they said no. Then on the last day we actually ordered a cab to the airport and it still took an hour to come to the hotel. We heard on the radio that they are starting a new thing where you can call a number and report cabbies that refuse to take you and they get banned for 10 days so it may not be a problem for much longer	
+	Sep 5 2005	Outstanding Hotel!!!	We stayed at this hotel for three nights and it was EXCELLENT!. The service was outstanding and the hotel was spotless. As the other reviews state it is under the flight path but we were on the first floor and could not really hear them fly over. The pool however was on the rooftop and there was no escaping the noise there. The location is only a few minutes away from the gold souks which was great. If you are looking to stay on the Diera side and want a good five star hotel then you can't go past this one. I would stay here again without a doubt. The service was that great I wanted to tip all the staff..	
-	Oct 23 2008 	forget this hotel	my first problem is that the hotel didn't have the room i'd booked (sea view towers room). instead they could only offer a cheaper room with a view of the building site at the side of the hotel and not a &quot;towers&quot; room. they had no real explanation why - in truth they probably over sell, expecting some cancellations. I wasn't too happy, since I have a starwood platinum card and expect at least to get the room I book (if not an upgrade), not a DOWNGRADE !!The room itself was quite bare with furniture and really noisy - both from the room above and from the corridor. You could hear everyone walk past and furniture being moved upstairs. The hotel is located at the end of the beach street, and thanks to all the road works and one-way system you must travel the whole length of the street, behind cars doing 7km/h. once I reached the hotel the car park was full on both nights so I could not park it myself. On the second night they moved me to the room i'd booked, it was bigger but really bare with furniture and quite a small window (if a sea view from it). noise problems remained. Thanks to this poor treatment I shortened my stay from 10 days to 2 days and moved to radisson residence about 1km away. for the same price I got a one bedroom flat that was a haven of silence.	
-	Apr 29 2009 	decent hotel in an indecent area	very garrish interiors of the rooms..howevr the service n food r really good..the area wher the hotel is located isnt great either but u hve lots of fastfood options if u want to step out also ther r money changers just next door...all in all its a decent but not a fabulous place to stay	
-	Mar 10 2006	Not great for business travellers	We chose this hotel because it was a relatively less expensive option than other hotels in Dubai. The staff were accommodating and nice, and the rooms are large and pleasant. The hotel is relatively central, meaning that it is a quick journey to nearby services, shopping malls, etc.However, we had chosen it on the basis that it advertised internet access. One huge drawback is that there is no internet access in the rooms. There is also no wireless connection in the hotel. There are two computers in the business center which offer high speed internet access.Also, the hotel is &quot;dry&quot; (no alcohol is sold on the premises, including their excellent Indian restaurant).	
+	Jul 21 2009 	Beautiful hotel 	Beautiful hotel...and pool. They bring you icy cold towels at the pool area.	
-	Sep 25 2009 	Great location good service but corporate	I have been staying there now several times and decided to write a review about it now.The hotel itself is in a great location when it comes to do business... right on Sheikh Said Road. The hotel offers spacious rooms with state of the art equipment and modern entertainment facilities, spacious bathrooms and a working desk. I got upgraded on a seperate check in desk as I am Member of Fairmonts Presidents Club, which membership is by the way free and well worth it. The service is great, food is good quality too... the 2 pools they offer, one on each side of the hotel is OK but small considering the size of the property. If it is on business occasion I would not stay anywhere else, but when it comes to leisure purposes I believe the hotel is a little to corporate and not unique enough. I'd rather go to the Raffles	
+	Apr 23 2009 	Blissful stay with outstanding service	We recently stayed for 10 days at this hotel and were delighted with our choice. Just before we came out we nearly changed to go with another hotel and I'm so glad we didn't. From the moment we arrived we were so impressed with the staff. We arrived 6AM and got early check in which was just what we needed. The room was nice, not huge but a good size for a standard rm.The beds are so comfortable, lovely feather pillows and nice linen. The bathrooms are really spacious, separate shower (really big cabin) bath and lots of nice amenities.We had a room on the corner so we could see both Sheikh Zayed Rd and up to Jumeriah and the Burq which was quite spectacular at night. The staff were the best thing about this hotel, nothing was any trouble and they were always so friendly and professional, especially the pool staff and the breakfast staff. The breakfast, by the way, is amazing so much choice and chefs ready to prepare omlettes, pancakes etc to order.	
+	May 22 2007 	A Wonderful Week!	Have just returned from a week at The Palace. We have eaten here before but this was our first stay. A great amount of thought and trouble is taken to make you feel special. The rooms are excellent and the staff wonderful. The grounds and beach are all you hope for. There is building work on nearby sites but these had no effect on our enjoyment. Truly 5 Star!	
+	Nov 16 2004	Would be excellent if it were not for the problems with restaurant reservations		
+	Jun 6 2005	Towers Rotana Hotel		
+	Aug 28 2009 	Heavenly bedHeaveny hotelHeavenly stay!	My partner and i stayed here for 8 nights &amp; i will try summarise everything to give people a good idea what to expect..Here goes...Check in: I can understand the review which is entitle &quot;mixed feelings&quot; because our check in was a bit like hers. We arrived very early after a very pleasant flight with virgin atlantic.I had emailed ahead to request a check in at 8.30am but when we arrived at the hotel it was all go at reception. There was only 2 people manning the reception desk and they were swamped. We waited 10 minutes before being greeted by a very nice receptionist called Moses, no cold face clothe or cool juice which we are used to receiving in hotels in Dubai (Kempinski &amp; Palm Tree court both had a much better check in more appropriate for a 5 star hotel in Dubai!!) I think the explanation for this is purely due to the early arrival &amp; business of the receptionists because we passed by reception a few times later in the evening and saw people checking in,being served juice etc.. No big deal though &amp; Moses escorted us to the breakfast room &amp; informed us that as we were leaving early on our last day we could take our breakfast on arrival instead. We really appreciated this &amp; though they were full the night previous they very kindly got us checked in 2 hours later.Breakfast: One word EXCELLENT.Its served in Blue Orange which is the best buffet I have seen in a hotel yet.Great choice both for breakfast and dinner.Dinners: We ate in Hunters which is excellent. I dont eat meat but there are fish &amp; vegetarian options.Its expensive.We spent about 150.00 for 2 starters,2 mains &amp; 2 desserts,1 g&amp;t &amp; 2 soft drinks.Service impeccable &amp; the waiter proudly informed us that it was voted the best steakhouse in Dubai by time out mag.Only sorry we didnt have the time for a return trip. Bussola also very good (genuine Italian) but the pizzaria was closed :( Never mind we had pizza in Cirros Pmodoro over in the sister hotel the Le Meridien.Great cheap and cheerful! The asian in the hotel was also excellent but could have done with a bit more variety.Also expensive.We drank most nights in the Atrium and loved the big comfy sofas and cakes &amp; fresh juice.Reasonable value too. The poolside bar lacked atmosphere and always had ants crawling on the counters which put me off it.I know its outdoors but needed to be cleaned waay more frequently. Room service incidently is alot better than other hotels Ive tried.Its food from blue orange &amp; arrives quickly.Yum.Beach: Lovely and quiet.Never too busy.We spent all our time here rather than the pools which were busier &amp; 2 of them closed for maintainance. The main pool is huge and well tended.Towels provided &amp; all the staff at the pools/beach very warm &amp; welcoming.Spa: Small &amp; expensive but very intimate &amp; luxurious surrondings &amp; i had the best massage of my life..called the butterfly effect &amp; it certainly was worth the price. I got a card for a 40% discount which meant i only paid about 75.00. Look out for these off staff!In conclusion I had an excellent stay &amp; on check out we ordered a taxi &amp; were asked would we prefer a hotel car or regular taxi which was good to have the option. There are buses to the malls etc..and taxis are cheap. We would both recommend this hotel strongly. The surrondings are beautiful &amp; central,right next door to the royal mirage and with views of the atlantis and Burj. There is building going on around but it never intrudes on the beach or in you room. We stayed in a seview delux room and it was a joy to wake up and sit on the balcony. The hotel rooms are excellent by even the fussiest persons standards. The hotels new so everything is new &amp; all the rooms have large kingsized beds and are large in size with all the mod cons.The cleaners will clean the rooms any time &amp; always are around working hard but they all have time to greet you &amp; smile which makes the difference in a hotel. I would urge anyone thinking of staying in Dubai to stay here particularly if its your 1st visit. It will not disappoint!! In terms of location &amp; amenities it would be hard to beat! We are already planning our return.Thanks to all the staff who made it such an enjoyable 4th visit to Dubai!	
+	Dec 17 2008 	Luxury but at a price	The Westin is an impressive and luxurious place to stay if in Dubai for business or pleasure. Entrance and public areas are designed in a contemporary style and have a feel of real quality.Rooms are also very comfortable - in this case executive rooms - with a nice view of the hotel pools, beach and the palm mushrooming additional accommodation (can a palm mushroom?).Food in the hotel was excellent standard but pretty expensive all things considered.In Room internet access excellent.Staff friendly and efficient but not overly welcoming.One slight complaint was that some of the corridors felt out of keeping with the rest of the hotel - just not up to the same standards but nothing that would interfere significantly with the overall experience.	
+	May 30 2005	Another Nice Low End Las Vegas Hotel	This was the final stop in my four hotel odeyssy this last week. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the suite. It is actually two rooms made into one room. So you have a front and back door. Nice size bathroom. The room was a tad musty but for the age of the renovation it was not bad for the money. Some of the downside issues. There was tons of mildew in the tub. The light would not shut off (this was a first for me), and a guy tried to sell me a fake rolex in the parking lot. But hey, this is Las Vegas. If you are in a pinch this is an average place to stay at average cost	
+	Apr 1 2007	Lovely sexy place	Had a lovely stay, the staff was very courteous and helpful, particularly Malorie and Ashley Hyde. Loved the artwork, the food was very good, the room was beautiful. Thanks to all, would love to stay again.	
+	Jan 25 2006	Great Escape from Typical Vegas	My girlfriend and I were looking for something in Las Vegas slightly different from the norm. She's really into upscale decor and unique atmospheres. I personally hate crowds and gambling, but I love places like Red Rock Canyon and Mount Charleston. We stumbled upon the Artisan and it satisfied both of our desires. We were off the strip (which I loved) but close enough to get there whenever we needed to. The ambience is different from anything I've ever seen before. You can spend hours checking out all of the artwork. The bar was my favorite place...they had outstanding food and I was able to have some drinks while watching football. We're coming back to Vegas in June and I can't wait to get to use the pool (it looks cool, but it's FREEZING in January). Overall, it's a really cool place that's a great alternative to typical Las Vegas.	
+	Aug 19 2007 	Good affordable place to stay	I was very skeptical about the place when i made the reservation but still decided to give it a shot. Upon arrival the Front desk staff was very helpful and the room was very clean and comfortable. I would definately come here again.	
-	Mar 11 2005	Horrible!		
+	Apr 25 2009 	Older hotelbut great rooms and service	We checked in at 3 in the morning,expecting to get into the Classic Room that we had booked.The lady at the desk asked if we would like a Suite for the first 3 nights.Of course we said yes.It was beautiful!IThe suite had a whirlpool tub,sauna room,2 bathrooms,king size bed,wraparound bar and an amazing view.All this for no extra charge.Not bad since we didn't even ask for an upgrade.I have only great things to say about Bally's,fantastic service and very nice staff.I would'nt have any trouble booking a room at Bally's again.	
+	Mar 4 2009 	Great value for the Strip	We stayed one night on a fluke. Our plane was cancelled and had to find last minute accomadations for the night- and Bally's was the cheapest with availability on the Strip. Since we were there for only one ngiht, they bumped us up to a large suite. The room was gigantic - could have been three rooms put together. Had a full bar/kitchenette area, powder room, large living room with 3 couches, dining area, and then a completely seperate large bedroom with two closets, and a grand bathroom (his and hers sinks, toilet, bidet, tub, and seperate shower.) The decor was very old, from the early 80s with no upgrades since. But it was very large and better than sleeping at the airport terminal!	
+	Aug 26 2009 	Elegant hotel great location	I stayed for 2 nights in March for a work meeting. I also stayed there in 2007. The rooms are very nice and clean, and the lakefront rooms offer fantastic views of the fountain show. Pool area is beautiful, while the poker room offers a lot of action and wide array of games. I would certainly stay there again.	
+	Aug 25 2009 	Dated	We stayed at the Bellagio from August 5th -14th. It was a special stay for us as we were getting married. The Lady on check in was miserable, we asked for complementary upgrade, she was stern and said no!On entering the hotel it was huge and beautiful, once in the room is was old and dated. Yes you could tell it was classy but it is in need of a refurb. The room was also very dark at all times of the day. The hotel was beautiful and a lovely place to stay, though we had paid a lot of money to stay here. I am not slating the hotel in any way we really liked it though it was not worth the money we had paid for it.When we go back to Vegas we will stay somewhere else, I love the Bellagio and looking around the shop and casino area is more appealing to me than staying in one of their rooms. I am glad were stayed there though next time it will be somewhere else for us. The location is great, especially for first timers, as you are central to everything. A lovely hotel, though like I say a bit dated.	
-	Jan 8 2009 	We were robbed!	We have stayed at Best Western hotel from Dec 16 to 21. On Dec 16, thieves broke into our car and took our video equipments worth $4000. They have tried to break the lock and take the car first. At last they finally broke the glass and took our cloths and video equipments. There is no necessary security available in the hotel. We have heard similar stories from other people who have stayed in the same hotel. On the second day, we woke up in the midnight after hearing some guys talking aloud outside. We were scared. They have left after some time.We have decided to leave the next day, and they said they wont refund the amount. Since we have booked our room through hotels.com, it was a mess talking to both of them to find a solution. None of them helped. Finally we have decided to stay back in case if we can get our stuff back. The hotel gave us some voucher for food and moved to a room close to the office.Unless the hotel increases the security, there is no safety. Even the thieves can take your car away.	
-	Feb 21 2006	OK If You REALLY Can't Afford To Stay On The Strip	My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights over Valentines weekend for his brothers wedding (the bride and groom wisely chose to stay at the Bellagio!)We on the other hand were on a strict budget and for that reason booked into the Mardi Gras.Service and staff helpfulness varied drastically. Depending on who was managing the front desk we were either pleasantly suprised or left open-mouthed at the incomptetence and rudeness of some staff members.After an 19 hour trip we arrived to find they'd booked us a double room with only 1 bed. My friend and I are close, but not that close! We rang down to the front desk who were polite but insistant that that's what we'd booked - we hadn't. After a miserable night (with me on the sofa)we were allocated a more suitable room - the one we had initially booked and profound apologies. The domestic staff were extremley helpful taking our bags to the new room and providing us with various toiletries which we'd forgotten to bring with us.The rooms themselves are surprisingly spacious, although the same cannot be said for the bathrooms. Basic, average and no-frills are a fair description.Location-wise you're fairly out of it here. The Strip is a 20-30 minute walk away. Although cabs vary from 7-11 dollars and the mono rail is 5 mins walk away.However, the hotel does provide a courtesy shuttle bus to Ballys on The Strip and to the airport, which is useful.Food-wise, you're best off heading on to The Strip for all meals where you'll get a better deal for you're money. That said we had breakfast at the Mardi Gras a couple of times and it certainly wasn't terrible.All in all it's fine if you just want somewhere to lay your head but by the time you've added cab fares/mono rail tickets to the price of your trip you're probably better off taking time to search for something a bit more interesting and well located on The Strip.	
+	Nov 28 2004	Up to expectations.	The staff was especially friendly. The room was very spacious and well designed. Most of the fixtures were new or well maintained.Bathroom was above average. Landscaping was nice. Large courtyard and pool/spa. Las Vegas monorail is still not running/broken, so rent a car.	
+	Nov 8 2009 	Love this place!	It had been several years since we stayed at Bill's - back when it was The Barbary Coast Hotel. We liked it then and now that it has been renovated, it is even more cozy.It has the best spot on the strip - right in the middle of everything - and nice, large rooms. We like the separate shower/toilet combinations and the views of the strip, including the Bellagio fountains. There are no gimmicks here - just a nice clean place to stay with several great restaurants on site. (we were a little chargrined at having to pay more - $20. per night - upon arrival for &quot;a room with a view&quot; - that did not happen previously)We were there for five nights this trip and will definitely return when our next trip to Vegas looms. You cannot beat this place for comfort and reasonable prices (even though we had to pay for a view!). The staff was cordial and we felt well taken care of and safe.	
+	Jul 20 2009 	A great room for a nice price	A good location in the middle of the strip.The room was very clean, quiet and large. I liked the old style. The hotel is more &quot;familial&quot; and cosy than the others. The only thing is you have to pay for internet but for 45$... The Bill's Gambling has a free parking too.	
+	Jan 28 2009 	Great Place to stay!	Dont get me wrong, I love the Vegas super resorts, they are outstanding and have their place. But these days, one of my big pet peeves with respect to Vegas it that it takes allot of time to do anything. Traffic and endless walking to your car/room/etc, cuts into your valuable limited Vegas time. So, what if you could stay in a clean, comfortable, older but nice room at a great price, and literally be 2 minutes from everything? Well, that is Bills. Again, the room is pretty basic, except for the 42 plasma TV on the wall, but the Stripside room views are amazing and you are 2 minutes from the lobby, 2 minutes from the parking garage 2 minutes from the casino, 2 minutes from restaurants and 2 minutes from the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd. And, the location is the absolute center of the strip, so you can easily walk to most of the big strip hotels.Another thing, no pool, but you can use the one at the flamingo. And, I would wager that the elevator ride/walk from your room at bills is shorter than that from many of the rooms within the Flamingo.So, if you are looking for fancy and new, look elsewhere. But if you come to Vegas for getting out and enjoying the action, consider Bills.	
+	Jan 7 2009 	One Night In A Mini-Suite	I love trying out new places especially downtown so I booked Binions for 1 night out of what turned out to be a 9 night stay due to snow. I only wanted to stay 1 night just in case it lived up to it's reputation! The registration gentleman could not have been nicer. He originally gave me a room on the second floor so I asked him if it was in the newly remodeled tower which he replied that the remodeling had not begun but will start in 2009. I must have looked disappointed because he looked in the computer again and said he had a mini suite available on the 12th floor, super! Well, it was not what I had envisioned. I probably would not have liked the regular rooms because the furnishings in the mini suite were old and worn. The carpet did look new, the bed was very comfortable but the bathroom was very small and the sink was so low that I couldn't imagine anyone over 5 feet being comfortable standing over the sink. As stated in a lot of the reviews, the windows were so filthy dirty that I could not get anything but a fuzzy picture of the view of the FSE. There was also a coffee maker in the room which is always a plus for me.All in all my stay at Binions was enjoyable and would not rule out staying there again but would be careful of the choice of rooms given.	
-	Oct 29 2009 	Beautiful hotel too big for me!	This hotel is in a convenient spot on the strip which is nice. The grounds are beautiful. We arrived to our room not being ready so we had to wait for a few hours, unless we wanted to pay for an upgrade. finally, when we got to our room, it was a very basic and older hotel room, we were not impressed, this is a 5 star hotel! after much complaining to management they moved our party of 2 rooms to another tower with nicer room for free. These rooms were beautiful, had comfy beds, flat screen tvs and a big bathroom. I guess this was the type of room they wanted us to upgrade to. The housekeeping staff were great. The one thing about this hotel is it is huge. It took 15 minutes to get to our hotel room from the front desk! The casino is massive. The forum mall is great to have so close by, and go to the cheesecake factory!Although this is a beautiful hotel, i wasn't impressed with the front desk service, and honestly this hotel is so big, it takes forever to get anywhere, not sure if i would stay here again.	
-	Sep 28 2009 	Great hotel fantastic location pity about the service	If you're staying in Vegas then Caesar's is probably in one of the best locations, roughly in the middle of the strip. While there is a bus service that stops at all of the casino's on the strip its often quicker to walk, which made Caesar's a winner in that regard.The rooms were well kept, even had a little TV in the bathroom! Very spacious and a massive bed. The pool was amazing, with a true Roman feel and plenty of places to just relax and unwind. The hotel itself is very grand and the internal architecture is quite impressive.However, you should forget about using the internet to check your emails etc unless you're happy to fork out $0.50/min.Unfortunately we found the service at Caesar's to be almost non-existant. If you want to speak to the concierge expect to wait on average 20 minutes, and in all instances but once they were far from helpful. How a hotel the size of Caesar's can only have 1 concierge is beyond me!After our room key malfuntioned it took approx 40mins to eventually get into the room after waiting at the front desk and then waiting for security - a process that would take most hotels no more than 10 mins....	
-	Apr 2 2009 	What a disappointment.	I was shocked about how bad my experience was at this hotel. I was really looking forward to staying and playing here for the weekend. Some of my friends were staying at other hotels. I thought that this hotel would be much more fun and comforable for everyone to gamble and hang out at. I was so wrong. We all felt very uncomfortable and scared with the crowd hanging out in the casino. I am sure that there was security all over the hotel but visible security, no where to be found. When entering the women's restroom, I was embarassed thinking I entered the men's mistakenly. That was not the case. There was a group of guy's in the women's restroom hitting on girls. Yes, hitting on girls in the restroom. When I made a comment about them being in the restroom they responded to me that the men's restroom was broken. These were loud and huge ghetto looking guys. The only thing that may have helped calm me down was the contact high I got from them. I was so uncomfortable that I did not stay any longer to play at this hotel. What was even more disappointing about my stay was that I paid to upgrade my room. I wish that I could have had something positive to report on my hotel stay. I did stay at another Harrah's property which I had a good experience at.	
+	Mar 31 2004	Overall good but there are major problems		
-	Oct 28 2009 	Sub Average...	We spent six nights at the hotel. We stayed because the price was one of the cheapest. But you get what you pay for. We had a long line to wait in for check in on a Monday evening when we arrived. When we finally were checked in, we discovered you can't just use a bell cart to bring things from the car lot to your hotel room, which is at least a 10-15 minute walk depending on where your room is. You have to use the bell person and they expect tips. So we did the work ourselves. Then we found that we only had a few TV channels, no cable, or HBO free. No internet free, anywhere, you have to use a credit card or pay for it, this is true almost all the places on the Vegas strip. Food is not cheap like it used to be. Buffet's are anywhere from $8-12 a plate. McDonalds are everywhere, including in the Circus Circus hotel. We checked in, and walked around the hotel, only to find that the Adventuredome and pools close at 6pm. So entertainment in the evening at this hotel consists of bars, or the casino. Even the midway trapeeze/circus acts end early. The pools are small, and lacking compared to the other hotels in the area. They are right next to the road so you get to view the traffic. We upgraded our room from the most basic to the tower for $5 more a night, but they were not upgraded yet, so the bed was very uncomfortable, you could feel every spring in the bed. We called for extra pillows and the housekeeping said they had a restriction on pillows because they were running low. The next day we went to the Adventuredome only to find out that the water log ride was closed for repairs. It remained closed the rest of the trip. For the price it was a room and bed to sleep in. We spent most the remainder of the trip elsewhere on the strip.	
+	Jun 9 2007 	Wonderful Cliffs	Second visit in three years to the Cliffs (RCI Points) and will not be our last.Wonderful stay, Rooms as before clean and very spacious, and LOVE the fact that you have your own wahing machines There is no need to hire a car as you are very near to shops and restaurants, recommend Egg Works, best breakfast, and the Italian (can't remember the name).Use the shuttle to go in and out of Vegas, and its so nice to come back and jump in the hot tub.Already making plans to return in 2008.	
+	Jan 16 2007 	Very Pleasant Experience	Apartment was very clean and well appointed. Staff extremely helpful, &amp; courteous. A couple of minor problems were attended to immediately and with a smile. Directions and recommendations for shopping, sights to see, &amp; resturants were spot on. Free computer room for guests offering hi-speed internet w/printer a definite plus. Location was excellent - close enough to get downtown rapidly, but far enough away for quiet relaxation. Full size washer &amp; dryer in unit another plus.	
+	Sep 20 2009 	suprising really great hotel near the strip quiet and family friendly	If your are smart enough the stay there ask for Autumn, Very polite with the southern hospitality.She was helpful with travel arrangments, places to eat and all sorts of cool ideas when it comes to making it to the strip, &quot;the best Ways around traffic and eazing through the city. She the best look her up!!!!!!	
+	Apr 11 2007 	Nice and Roomy	We sat in on another timeshare and got a 3-days 2-nights at the Desert Paradise. We had to pay extra for booking the stay during a weekend. We had a 2 bedroom unit. It was large and roomy. That's one advantage it had over a hotel room, lots of space. It was typically funished and had a separate room for the washer and dryer. The only problem was the thin walls. We can hear the people in the unit above us. The plumbing was also loud. And it takes a long time for the water to get hot. They have a security gate that is closed after 8pm. Only guests with the gate code can get in. I've read in earlier posts about getting things stolen, but we didn't have any problems.	
+	Sep 29 2009 	Excellent!	My wife and I stayed here in a recent trip to Las Vegas. As a traveling couple the room actually exceeded our needs for an overnight stay. Very roomy, clean, comfortable, TVs in the main room and bedroom, a full kitchen, and a wall-safe to leave our valuables while out. Adequate parking, elevators, and a security gate. The front desk staff were superb! There might be better values for the same amount of money (as I said, the room was more than we needed) but we would not hesitate to return.	
+	Sep 29 2009 	Great place to stay close to the Strip. Clean and Friendly.	The hotel was clean and friendly. Very close to all the attractions of the Vegas strip. This would be a great place for Families to stay as the rooms have all you need to not have to go out and eat at the expensive restaurants. If you use the Shuttle from and to the airport they drop you off right at the door.	
+	May 8 2007 	Whatta Deal!	What a pleasant surprise! Our first vacation in 12 years, and we came to town for a big convention. While our friends were spending $200 a night on the Strip, my wife booked us online - round-trip flights from Denver and three nights @ the ElCo for less than $190.00 each. Do the math!We didn't do much except sleep &amp; shower here, but it was great place to base out of. 5th-floor tower rooms had a great view south to the Strip... the lights were beautiful. The beds were VERY comfortable, shower was fine, free valet parking across the street was very nice (and got an extra tip at the end of the week).We walked to Fremont St Exp a couple of times and always felt completely safe. Only got quietly panhandled once, and that was in the daytime. My wife said she enjoyed Fremont more than the Strip, because the Strip was overwhelming... too much to see. Plenty of cheap souveniers downtown, too ;-)Only real annoyance... $12 dollar a day wireless Internet, and I always had problems getting online.Condo construction across the street, currently remodeling the porte cochere entrance to the hotel, and Fremont St in front of the casino was being repaved/rebuilt... you could occasionally hear the construction, but it was NEVER a problem for either of us.We've told lots of friends what a great deal we got... we'd stay here again in a heartbeat... thank, ElCo, for a great stay!	
+	Nov 30 2006	Surprised	I was a little leary coming to this hotel after some of the reviews I read, and honestly only picked this place because I wanted my Hilton Honor Points. When I pulled up to the hotel, I was even more leary.....the exterior is quite &quot;70's&quot; and I was afraid the interior would be as well. I was pleasantly surprised to see the place has been completely remodeled. New furniture, carpet, and granite countertops to boot! My room was a spacious two room suite with a kitchenette. The other benefit was they have their own parking lot, so I didn't have to walk three blocks or valet park to get to the hotel. Free drinks at the evening reception were a plus as well. This great place to stay if you don't mind being a little ways off the strip!	
+	Jun 17 2009 	Good value quieter than on Strip and great staff. Shuttle to strip and airport.	Embassy suites are always good value as you get two rooms and a good breakfast included in the price. This hotel was away from the strip (which is what we wanted) and so was much quieter than hotels with a casino. All staff, receiption, waiters, cooks or cleaners were very friendly and efficient. The breakfast was very good - plenty of choice of cereals, bread, cakes, fruit and drinks - and the freshly cooked omelettes were excellent. The hotel runs a free shuttle to the strip between 7.00 and 10.00 am and between 4.00 and 7.00 pm. - and also to the airport. Shuttle drivers were helpful and polite. I feel it would probably be better for guests if the shuttle to the strip ran between 9 and 12 noon as most people don't want to miss breakfast or have to get up so early on holiday. The decor in this hotel on Swenson Street was a little 'tired' - but not scruffy and it was immaculate. We felt a little sorry for the chefs and waiters as hardly anybody ate in the hotel in the evening - I suppost some people used room service. We ate there twice when we were too tired to go out again - the service was fine and the food was good though not gourmet ! It was fun to see Elvis and Priscilla the two swans who live in the pool in the atrium - they seemed very happy to be there. Our one complaint was that whilst we were there a group of teenage girl basket ball players were staying - and they were very noisy - leaning over the balconies and calling to each other - in typical giggly l4 year old manner. We felt the staff should have asked them to consider other guests. Once in our room we did not hear any outside or room to room noise. As the hotel is family friendly there are often a lot of children staying. The swimming pool outside was very pleasant. All in all a very reasonably priced hotel with great staff. Oh and there is also a business centre with two computers for you to check in online or check your emails - rooms are also set up for wi-fi if you have your laptop with you.	
+	Jul 14 2009 	the best family trip ever	Our family stayed at the Emerald Suites on Las Vegas Blvd last month for a two week stay.We chose this hotel because it had kitchens and it wasnt right in the middle of the craziness on the strip.We were able to go to the store and grocery shop just like we were at home! We saved a bundle cooking our own meals!We had a two bedroom suite, so our son had his own bedroom and we had the privacy of our own bedroom-both bedrooms had king sized beds!Our room-actually suite-was pretty large and we even had a TV in our bedroom.Our son enjoyed swimming in the pool everyday and my husband was able to do his regular exercise routine in the fitness center at the hotel.I didnt have to find a laundry mat-the hotel has two!This hotel is one of the best family hotels we have stayed at in Vegas! It is clean and quite and the price we paid was great!	
-	Sep 9 2009 	BEWARE OF BLATANT UPSELLS 	Steve Wynn apparently has his first failure on his hands. Why else would he authorize his entire front desk staff to use cheesy laminated photographs of his hotel rooms  strategically shot to showcase views  and encourage them to blatantly lie and enhance the truth in an attempt to squeeze hotel guests for $25 or more extra per night beyond the rate they agreed to pay? Outside of Las Vegas, we call this BAIT &amp; SWITCH. At Encore, they'll tell you that the non-smoking room you reserved is not available, but for an UPCHARGE, you can not only have the non-carcinogenic space that you reserved and have a right to, but a better view. Or, they'll tell you that their nightclubs are VERY LOUD. How loud? So loud that the room you booked will be thumping until 4AM. So . . . for a minor UPCHARGE, you can have a room on a higher floor (with a better view!) and save yourself the misery of being kept awake half the night.Did Wynn really build his new hotel with paper thin windows and walls? And if he did, does the music really need to be so loud? Are nightclub guests more coveted than hotel guests?The poor management of this property has infuriated numerous guests to the point that they will not return. Short sighted attempts to squeeze $25 more per night out of guests who fall for the trickery is unethical at best and illegal at worst.It's a sad, sad day that someone of Mr. Wynn's status - and such a beautiful property as Encore - has stooped so low. This reviewer will never return to this immoral property and encourages all readers to stay at one of Mr. Wynn's former properties, now owned and operated by MGM Mirage, including Bellagio or The Mirage, or one of the three hotels at Mandalay Bay.DON'T GET RIPPED OFF!	
-	May 30 2009 	Not up to Par	A quick two night visit to the Encore over the Memorial Day weekend had some positives &amp; negatives. Checking in on the Sunday of the weekend around 4pm, I was greeted with dizzying lines at check-in &amp; despite a confirmed, pre-paid reservation, no rooms were available for immediate check-in. Some people in line were absolutely brutal to the staff, but this was a 5-star, 5-diamond hotel that was telling people like myself that we'd have to leave our bags with the valet &amp; come back in a couple of hours when there was availabillity. Not being a huge gambler, I went to the pool. The European pool was just what I needed. Cold cocktails, fun music, lots of Memorial weekend party-ers drinking, NBA playoffs on TVs, high limit poolside gambling, photo posing... many lovely ladies topless. A delightful diversion from reality! A couple hours later, a room was available. Unfortunately, it was a king bed room, not the two double beds that my reservation had requested. A roll-out bed was delivered... with the same top quality linens the room beds are fitted with. No issues with my stay until check-out. The automated system for in room check-outs was down causing extra long lines &amp; delays in the reception area. Once again, I heard some truly rude &amp; nasty tirades from my fellow guests over their Encore experience. I do not envy their customer service staff!I was somewhat surprised that there were no &quot;comps&quot; made for my inconveniece at the commencement of my trip... but I guess even Steve Wynn is feeling the recession. In closing, the Encore is a beautiful property. The rooms are beyond comfortable. The Encore experience can be quite sinful if you hang out at the pool or at their XS nightclub. All that said, I don't believe this is worthy of 5-stars/diamonds. In the future, I might visit the Encore again but if I had the option of the theHotel at the Mandalay, the Palazzo or Bellagio, I'd choose them first.	
-	Oct 3 2009 	The Excaliber has Become a Larger Motel 6	My wife and I checked into the Excaliber and the desk person immediately showed us the &quot;upgrade list&quot;. Why should you have to upgrade when you already have a reservation? We were given keys to a room on the fifith floor overlooking the pool. A fairly clean room that was well worn and used. Not the cleanest but not the dirtiest! The bedspread was torn, the sheets were threadbare, and they also had a hole in them and the bathroom towels were worn and smelled like they were burnt. The hallways were never cleaned in the three days that we stayed there. People bring drinks up from the casino and them put them in front of their room doors where the same four glasses remained throughout our stay. I called housekeeping and alerted them to no avail. The buffet was running a special $25.00 dollars for food all day that they were open, what a deal. OK food but nothing to rave about, if you are a big eater or traveliong with a family what a bargain, three squares and all of the snacks you could want. Bring baggies like everyone else did, Overall a good place for families on a budget, great location, good shows lots of noise and lots of kids running!	
+	Apr 11 2008 	good value	This was my first stay at the Fitz and my first stay in the Fremont St. area. My room was fine, and the maid service was good. Unlike others, I had no elevator problems. The buffet the first nite was adequate, and I had clipped a coupon in my arrival book which made the price better. Motel staff was corteous to me. I did find the casino to be a bit smokey, but I find many to be that way, as I am a non-smoking asthmatic. They did provide me with a non-smoking room. I think Atlantic City will soon be totally smoke free, and I can't wait for that to happen nationwide. If you are expecting total luxury accomodations, this isn't it, but you are not paying for it, either. On the other hands, the rooms compare to any standard motel and are a good value....I had all that I needed, including hairdryer and iron/ironing board......the room was clean, comfortable, and I had a nice view. I like the whole Fremont street thing....old Vegas....the gambling (and everything) is cheaper, you can get around very fast, etc.....I actually think you get a more &quot;down home/down to earth&quot; feeling there than the extravagance of the strip. I would go back to the Fitz, and as long as Fremont Street is offering better deals, there is a good chance I will stay there again.	
+	May 1 2006	No problems at the Fritz.	We stayed at the Fritz April 24-28 of 2006. The was our first time staying downtown and found it to be great. Every casino and shopping is just a short walk, not like on the strip where you have to walk long distances to see everything. We found the hotel to be very clean and the staff was very friendly. We had some concerns from others that left reviews on the Fritz, but wanted to find out for ourselfs. The rooms had everything that was needed including extra pillows and the AC worked just fine. The elevators were quick with very little waiting time. We ate at all the buffets downtown and all were decent but found the Golden Nugget to be the best downtown. On our next trip we will stay at the Fitzgeralds again.	
+	Apr 12 2004	Clean and Reasonable	Recently stayed at the Fitzgerald's downtown Las Vegas, April 1-4, 2004 with two other friends. Room was comfortable, bathroom roomy. Staff friendly. Russell at the Daquari Bar was not the most pleasant bartendar. Go to the free Elvis show. Lots of fun. I would stay at the Fitzgerald's again.	
-	Nov 14 2009 	With all the great deals in Vegas nowadays stay elsewhere	I recently stayed there for five days with my extended family, including two elderly people. We were looking for a fun holiday and had contacted this hotel directly receiving great rates and promise of some nice rooms. Told reservationists about the limitations of the older guests and was told they would be well looked after.Upon arrival, no such thing existed. Waited about 30 minutes to check in. I seem to know more about the hotel than our front desk clerk. He wanted to put us first in a handicap room and told us neither of the rooms would have any view whatsoever. That is how the encountered started. We said our biggest concern was two have the elderly guests near an elevator. We had mentioned that to both the reservationist and the front desk clerk. I stay in hotels over 100 nights a year and have never stayed as far away from the elevator as our original rooms were. The front desk agent was right about one thing: the view was horrible. That wouldn't have been okay, if the room wasn't filthy, dingy and dark. The in room phone did not work. I had to call the front desk on my cell phone. There were black marks over the wall. The bathroom contained no soap or shampoo. The room was non-smoking, but wreaked of smoke. The next day, after several calls, we were moved. The new rooms were clean and located near an elevator. The manager we finally dealt with was professional and kind. All the other employees we dealt could have cared less. And with each call, we had to start the entire story again.The second room was smaller, but clean. Our TV remote didn't work; the room had only one working outlet and very little light. At least you could see out of these windows. The second room had been removed since the first rooms. Of the four rooms were were in during our week, we never saw a &quot;deluxe room&quot; that looked like the one pictured on the hotel website.Ate at two restaurants while there: both were fine. Service was good, but the food was pretty bland. The casino is cramped; one of the waitress scolded one of our guests. She was waiting for someone to come and get her winnings out of a broken slot machine. She asked the waitress for a drink and was told &quot;you need to put some money in first&quot;With all the great deals going on in Las Vegas right now, I would not make this same mistake again. I was seduced by a friendly reservationist promising nice rooms, great service and a low rate. I only got the low rate. I wish I would have shopped around more and had a much better time. Can't imagine ever going back to the Flamingo.	
+	Jul 13 2009 	Excellent Stay	Second stay at Four Queens--it will not be my last. Outstanding customer service. (One snippy person the whole week all over the city, and it happened to be the players' club redemption lady who waited on me!) Clean, comfortable hotel. I like the fact that Four Queens has coffeemakers in the rooms. I had not tried Binion's pool before this trip, and I liked it. Four Queens doesn't have a pool, so they have made arrangements to use Binion's. It is a small pool, but not at all crowded, and it really wasn't too much of a hassle to walk across the street--it's still less walking than one would have to do at any Strip hotel. As always, Magnolia's food was excellent. Slots were good. Drink service was good. The service everywhere in Las Vegas was excellent this trip--I think the economy has changed some attitudes. Anyway, book the Four Queens with confidence that you will have a nice stay.	
+	Mar 17 2009 	A beautiful haven away from the crowds	We toured the other hotels on the strip and went to shows, etc... but just LOVED being able to get away from it all when it came time to rest and go to sleep. The hotel is beautiful and serene. There were NO crowds whatsoever. Check in was a breeze, lots of room at the pool, very comfortable rooms, service was friendly and helpful. The spa is georgeous and one of the best I've been to (and I love going to spas). They also don't charge extra for things like gym use, DVD player, pool use, etc.. Really great place to stay. Only thing to be cautious of is some of the rooms face the airport and you might be bothered by plane traffic if you're a light sleeper (we asked for a room away from the airport and it was very quiet).	
+	Nov 16 2004	Get Away From the Casino Noise	The Four Seasons is a great hotel for those who don't like the noise and crowds of hotels with casinos. For those who do want a casino in their hotel, the Four Seasons is still the place - just take the elevator down to the Mandalay Bay casino. Since the Four Seasons has a separate entrance from Mandalay, it is a quiet respit from the casino.Though their standard rooms seem somewhat small for a Four Seasons, the amenities and service are excellent. L'Occitane de Provence bathroom products are a bonus, including a lavender linen spray should you need to iron! One note about the Four Seasons Spa: use the spa at Mandalay Bay instead, the facilities are much better.It was too chilly to use the pool, but it looked very nice. Guests may also use the huge pool facilities at Mandalay, but the Mandalay guests may not use the Four Seasons pool. The Verandah restaurant is excellent.Although the hotel is at the end of the Strip, there is a tram going from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and Excalibur. You still have to walk to other hotels from the Excalibur tram station, but it does get you a bit closer.	
+	Jul 12 2004	The Best Hotel In Las Vegas	This is the letter that I wrote to the GM of the hotelDear Four Seasons,I would like to begin this letter on point, before going into full detail about our stay. You should be proud to know that we feel that you run &quot;the&quot; best hotel in the city of Las Vegas. We have been to Vegas five times, and out hotels have included The Bellagio, MGM Grand, and Venetian. Everything from the lobby to the pool rivals that of those hotels stated. We were greeted with a beautiful room that was ready upon our arrival, as per a request for early check-in. And enjoyed a wonderful lunch by the pool, during our stay our servers included Katie, Chaz and Leslie. Leslie was wonderful, she treated our family with such care and love, and should certainly be looked upon as the best of your staff. Everyone at the pool was magnificent, we were given such personal attention, towards the end of our stay we were even greeted by name, before even checking in. Pool attendants included Steve, Margaret, Vivian, James and Moses. And at the porte cochere Gerry the valet was wonderful, always greeting us with a pleasant smile every evening. Those however are just a handful of names that we remember, but we cannot say that we had a single less then standard attendant, they were all magnificent. On the last day of our stay, after checking out, our daughter Ashli became very ill, almost immediately James, Leslie, and Moses, were on the phone with the front desk, and within minutes we had a room for a few hours so she could rest away from the blazing heat. This is service that goes above and beyond what anyone else would do, and truly sets the Four Seasons apart from all others. Every single inch of the hotel exudes a level of service is bar none of anything we have ever experienced. I was truly amazed. Although nothing is perfect, the Four Seasons is close, and to help you get there I would like to offer you some suggestion. Compared to the other hotels in Las Vegas, your housekeeping, or turndown service is extremely below standard. Robes and slippers should be placed near the bed, and something should be offered such as bottled water fruit or chocolate. With the exception of that area, please keep up the excellent work. We have spoken about next years trip, and even with all of the new hotels opening, the Four Seasons Las Vegas will be the only hotel that the we will stay at forever more.	
+	Feb 6 2009 	Always A Good Experience	Just returned from a stay lasting from February 1st through the 5th. Hit a little bump with the agreed-on price but it was corrected without any problem. Recommend you make notes and get names when you get confirmation numbers. Also dates of conversations. We made reservations on the 31st of December at $64 per room. Then I found on their site at $56, called and had it confirmed. And then, for like a day, they had a price at $36, which was confirmed. The problem is that you are talking to a central booking person, not the desk person! Another bump was the new TGIF. They haven't gotten their act together yet and the service is okay but it takes forever to get the food out. Since this is the only restaurant for breakfast you're kind of a captive audience. We used to eat only at the Courtyard Cafe but its only open from 1AM to 6AM. This is when we started using the buffet. The problem with me is that its all so good that I eat too much and have a problem leaning over the craps table. We checked in for two rooms, my 90 year old mother-in-law too, with no problem about 12 noon. Tables were evil and lost more than I wanted, as usual. Dealers and pit personnel were great, as usual. Ate at the buffet a couple of times on a slot special for age 50+. Had a great dinner at the Cortez Steak Restaurant and also had tickets to see KA at the MGM(great show). All-in-all a pleasent time by all. My son and his girl friend also came in for a couple of days and my sister-in-law and her husband came over from the Paris Hotel for a visit for dinner and gambling. This is probably our 8th visit to the GC, and 15th overall visit to LV, and we have never been disappointed. Yes, its a mile from the Strip. Yes, its mostly older couples and locals. Yes, the bathroom is small(except for the newly remodeled premium rooms). Yes, there's not a lot of bling and bright sparkle. But, knowing this going in, you should not be disappointed and you will enjoy your stay at a very resonable price. If its your first visit to Las Vegas, I would not recommend it as your first experience. But, if you've been here a number of times then I do recommend you give it a try.	
+	Jul 1 2007 	Good value decent rooms	A high school buddy and I recently stayed at the Gold Coast (June 25-27th). The casino delivers a clean, decent room at a very reasonable price, details follow: -The room was of a very good size with reasonable wooden, &quot;block&quot; furniture. To the extent it would look like a dorm room, there is surprisingly tasteful paintings and lamps as well as a terrific flat screen TV. The bathroom is extremely small, however. I was in room 765. It was very quiet. -The casino offers the full assortment of games and table minimums are very low. There is also a bingo parlor, which was of notable size and is fun to play in with the small computer terminals they give you. -There is a gigantic bowling alley, which is very modern and has a well appointed lounge that looks like it was very recently completed. The pool, however, is very small. -Casino workers were friendly and approachable while the crowd at the casino seemed generally nice. -We did not eat at the restaurants other than a hotdog (for around $1) at the stand in the sportsbook, which was good. -The casino is near the Rio and Palms, which offer greater dining choices. -The shuttle to the strip was very convenient.	
+	Nov 16 2003	Great place	This was a great place. Although it was off the strip the free shuttle bus makes up for it. It was relatively cheap and had a great buffet.	
+	Nov 22 2009 	economico e basta		
+	May 4 2009 	Very pleasant stay. The best downtown	Clean, relaxing, great food, pool, rooms and loungesworth the extra dollars. Great fun	
-	Jun 21 2009 	Don't Do the Timeshare Presentation!!!	When we got there, check-in was a breeze. The talked us into listening to &quot;a 90 minute presentation about the property and some of the projects that were going on.&quot; The next morning we did the presentation. We told the person we were assigned to right away that we weren't interested in buying a timeshare, we were just doing it for show tickets. She said, &quot;So you are just here to waste my time?&quot; I thought that was a little rude. The presentation was also to include a free &quot;breakfast.&quot; Turns out it was donuts, muffins, coffee, and lemonade. Not even milk or juice. Two and half hours later the &quot;manager&quot; was giving us his &quot;final&quot; offer and when we declined it and said we just weren't interested in buying at the moment, he said, &quot;Okay, whats the real reason you aren't buying?&quot; Again I thought that was rude and Im not quite sure what he was implying. THREE HOURS later we got our discount Cirque du Soleil tickets and were able to leave. I wish I would have never agreed to do it because it really aggrivated me!!! Anyways, the rooms were nice and clean. The walls were a little thin but we must have had pretty quiet neighbors because we didn't hear them too much. The pool area was very nice, a little cold, but never overly crowded. The only other thing I can complain about was that we ran out of toilet paper one day and called to the front desk to get some. We left, and 10 hours later we got back and still had no toilet paper. My husband called up to the front desk and ripped them apart a little bit. About 15 minutes later we finally got some t.p. Overall, the hotel was nice, a good value, but don't do the timeshare presentation unless you are interested in buying one. Also NOT ENOUGH PARKING!!!	
+	Oct 16 2008 	Nice Place	This was a very nice comfortable place to stay, especially if you plan on being in Vegas for a week or more. We had all of the comforts of home. It was nice that the bedroom is private from the rest of the condo since we had our daughter with us. There was a pull-out sofa bed in the living room, a full-sized kitchen, a dining room, and a laundry area! The pool area was very pretty but they use salt to keep the water clean and it looked a little dirty. My only complaint was regarding the hotel's itenerary of activities going on... it states that some of them are free and some cost. I decided to try out the &quot;complimentary facials&quot; one day and was severely disappointed when I was ushered into a Mary Kay party! There was no turning back once I got in there. The sales lady was extremely pushy and I felt jipped. I thought that was false advertising and very unprofessional for them to call it a &quot;complimentary facial&quot;. Just be aware that nothing is free there! Not even the game room. It costs 75 cents to play any of the games. Othere than that it was a nice place and the casino next door is nice too.	
+	Apr 9 2006	Beautiful but noisy!	The Grandview is beautiful. We stayed in a 2 bedroom lockout unit which gave us two one bedroom units each with its own kitchen, jacuzzi, washer &amp; dryer and living room. The 1600 sq feet for the two rooms was more than enough.The furniture and decor is gorgeous and perfectly fitting to the desert location. There are tile floors and area rugs in the living room and dining room while the bedroom has wall-to-wall carpet. The jacuzzi tubs could easily fit two people.The pools were simply beautiful. There were two pools and one large jacuzzi. One of the pools has a free form rock formation complete with waterfall. Music is piped into the pool area adding to the peaceful environment.We requested a handicapped room at time of booking but even though they had it in the notes they had not saved one for us. We checked in on Sunday and had to wait until Tuesday to get the handicapped room. That was both inconvenient and hard on our handicapped person. The day we switched rooms they tried to get us to vacate the room we were in before the other one was ready. We, of course, refused.While there is no on site restaurant, the South Coast Casino is next door and has several restaurants including a breakfast at the cafe for less than two bucks if you go before 7 a.m..The location is 5 miles from the start of the mega resorts on the strip. They offer a free shuttle but if you don't mind driving a rental car it seems to be a better option since valet parking is free at every hotel. However, beware that you may have to park very far away from your buildings entrance (not good for if you returning late at night). The parking lot design was not done very wisely and handicapped parking is very limited.The insulation between the rooms does not seem to exist. You can hear everything! Thanks to reading previous reviews some of our party came prepared with enough ear plugs for the entire party. It really was weird how loud everything was at this property.The decor is and layout is very upscale. The noise, if you are prepared, is easily managed. Even with the negatives, we really enjoyed our stay here and would come again.	
-	Jun 3 2004	not so good.....	The hotel was in an awful area, and the outside looked even worse! Very disappointed, but the chapel is pretty......	
+	Aug 20 2005	did us right	The airline put us up here after cancelling our flight. Both shuttle drivers were extremely courteous and friendly, and so were the bartenders. Check-in smooth, even tho we asked for a smoking room and got a nonsmoking, they had us switched literally within a couple of minutes. Roomy room, a little worn, but clean and adequate. Good drinks. Not much happening in the immediate neighborhood.	
+	Nov 25 2009 	Super fun	Awsome pools, lazy river, hot tubs, and hot tubs!!!	
+	Nov 4 2009 	the beast that is the priest THX Hard Rock!	We booked this trip primarily to see Judas Priest at Thomas and Mack arena. What better place than the Hard Rock to stay . RIGHT? Location! short easy walk.The beast that is the Priest was AWSOME! Best show ever! The Vegas fans were great!all the people at the arena were nice, and the Hard rock also delivered! Our check in was very easy, we got a great room in the old edition on the sixth floor near the middle,GREAT view of the strip and pool area, and the doors open up to let in the sights, sounds and energy of vegas like NO OTHER Hotel Casino in Vegas can! The room was clean,maid service top notch! Everyone we encountered there was VERY nice!But having that french balcony was incredible! The pool was fun but not quite what I expected.(We had very high expectations) But the Barmaids and drinks made up for it.We booked an extra day so we could experiance Rehab! Did not dissapoint. Soddem and gamorra.whether at the pool or watching from our balcony from above, what a party!We also got tickets to the WEC fight that night at The Joint. WOW! Hard Rock knows how to pull off any event with style.Had a great time, all 4 days. We will be back when all the construction is done. But not to stay at the new towers, nothing could compare to the french balcony's open air exciement and energy	
+	Jun 20 2006	Special meal deal	We did not stay at the Hard Rock Las Vegas but we did manage to walk to the hotel and eat their 777 special meal deal. The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was fulfilling and the ambiance throughout the casino was great and had a nice young feeling. Great memorabilia throughout the 1st floor of the establishment. Its off the beaten path but theres always a taxi cab to take us where we wanted to go.	
+	Jan 25 2006 	Gotta love the Hard Rock.	Granted, I usually stay at the Hard Rock mid-week for business so I rarely spend more than $120 for my room. I always find it to be a good value. The rooms are stylish and spacious. The staff is good. There is an abundance of nice restaurants and the hotel is so easy to get in and out of. Request a strip view room.	
+	May 20 2009 	GREAT STAY!!!!!	We stayed at Harrahs on 5-15-09 to 5-18-09. I got a great deal and took a chance on an older property. I was a winner with this gamble. Not only is the location great but the property is to. The staff was very friendly. I work in the industry so I always look for great guest service. I am not one of those unrealistic people that look for more then what I pay for. But I got what I paid for and much more. If you are looking for the glitz and glamour there are many properties that you can chose from but you are going to pay for it like you should. If you are looking for a place that takes pride in its property and the guests that stay with them you need to stay at Harrahs. Harrahs has every thing you need from food to night life. The piano bar was great and carnival court was fun if you like that kind of night club. The only thing I didnt like was the fact that they allow people to solicit out side. I became very tired of the line of people outside clicking cards for call girls. But its all up and down the strip so just get used to it. As this was our first trip to Vegas I want to give first timers some tips. #1 dont think you have to see everything the first day. You will kill yourself and be sore and tired the rest of your stay. #2 the monorail is a great way to get around. You can buy a 24hr pass for around $13 and it saves a whole lot of walking, I wish I had figured this out the first day lol. #3 you dont have to break the bank to go to vagas. I had a budget and came home with much more money then I thought I would, it just depends on what you what to do and see. Over all we hade a great trip and will stay at Harrahs next time.	
+	Oct 16 2008 	Fantastic as usual!!	My husband and I stayed at Harrahs 10/7-10/14. We had booked a limo again for pick up as we did last year. Our driver was right there at baggage claim. The cost of $48.00 was worth it to us, as we were helped with our luggage, and were treated like royality as per usual Harrahs! Check in was easy. They did not have a room ready with a king bed, but did have 2 queens available. It was only 10:30 am, but we opted to take it as we had been travelling for many hours. We had room 2345, in the Carnaval Tower. There was a nice view of the Mirage, as well as part of Caesers Palace, part of Venetian, and Treasure Island. The air conditioning is sensor controlled, but can be easily bypassed if you just look at it and set it right. Everyone was friendly as usual. Housekeeping was exceptional. I do suggest that anytime anyone has a problem, just contact them. We always leave $5.00 per day tip. We had room service many times, and although we were told it would be 45 minutes, it usually came within 20. Video Poker was wonderful to both myself and my husband. We won several thousand dollars playing 25cents at max credits. Cocktail service was wonderful as usual. The beds are glorious! Perfect mattresses, and plenty of pillows. We also charged back to our room visits to Toby Keiths, PepperRose, and Margaritaville. We had $5.00 off of flavors buffet, and gladly spent the full price the second time around for breakfast. Hubby tipped prior to seating, and was tended to constantly. There isn't a bad thing to say here. No noise from other rooms, or the hallway. When departing, our limo driver was waiting for us (we were 5 minutes early). Again, very cordial. I wish everyone a wonderful stay as we had at Harrahs!!!	
+	Apr 7 2008 	Great Service	I didn't stay at the hotel because my friends booked the wrong hotel. But the registration manager went out of his way to call the other property and got us a room for the same price, for a hotel with better location. It was so nice for him to do that. I will highly recommend this hotel.	
+	Jul 11 2007 	Would go back any day	Our first time in Vegas, and can't say enough about a GREAT place to great stay ! Middle of the strip (had a rented van, but never used it during our 4 days there) with PEACEFUL gardens &amp; spacious room to relax . Hotel shares tropical garden &amp; pools &amp; water slides / falls with the Flamingo; alot happening there, but nice to come back to the peace of this hotel. Great staff, clean rooms, easy access to room, workout room, small deli with good breakfast sandwhiches. Went with our 3 kids (ages 14 - 22) to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, and everyone loved being able to spread out in the room, even my reluctant outdoorman husband.From here headed to Grand Canyon, Sedona, Mesa Verde and S. Utah national parks after; Vegas is a great start and stop point.	
+	Jun 21 2007 	Great location Great staff Great place	My wife and I stayed here for a week recently. This was one of the best experiences I have ever had. We flew to Las Vegas and took a limo to the property. The lack of a car was not a problem for a few reasons. First, the property is located right on the strip behind the Flamingo hotel. You are within comfortable walking distance of Paris, Bally's, Caeser's Palace and Harrah's. It is also a short walk to the Mirage, the Venetian and Treasure Island. There is a monorail station directly behind the Grand Vacations Club. You do have to enter through the Flamingo. But being so close to a station is a major convenience. It is so easy to hop on go to the MGM Grand, the Las Vegas Hilton or Sahara.The room we had was a two bedroom. It came complete with two hot tubs, a full size kitchen and dining and living areas. The beds and all furnitue were comfortable. Because all rooms face the strip, all rooms have terrific views. We were on the top floor. From our room we had a perfect view of the fountain show at the Bellagio.The staff of the hotel was flawless. Whether it was checking in and out, getting a cab, tickets to a show or a dinner reservation. The staff were so willing to help. Top notch.Last and certainly not least was the grounds of the property. The Grand Vacations Club shares space with the Flamingo. This includes the pool, tennis courts and the gardens. The Flamingo gardens are gorgeous. There are penguins, turtles and of course, flamingos. Very romantic spot for an evening stroll.	
+	Oct 23 2009 	HGVC's new resort in Las Vegas	We loved the fact that this HGVC resort had room service! Beautiful accommodations, most comfortable bed I've ever slept in outside of my home, helpful staff &amp; a Starbucks on site :) It is a bit out of the way if you are wanting to spend time at Mandalay Bay, Mirage, etc... but cabs are plentiful. I would like to see a bigger &amp; better staffed restaurant at the pool, the food was very good but the service was far too slow. The only other change we'd make is to put flat screen tv's in all rooms..don't make us choose between a Jacuzzi or a flat screen tv... most of us have both at home and expect them when we travel.	
+	Aug 23 2008 	Nicely Appointed Suites	The rooms are nicely appointed and equipped. Ours had a washer/dryer as well as the full kitchen. The living room was nicely done with a comfortable sofa to watch the flat screen TV. There was a full dining room set, also. Beds are very comfortable with good linens and the bath had a separate jacuzzi as well as shower and marble sink. The pool area is very nice and is well used. We will be going back soon.	
+	Oct 31 2006 	Loved this resort!	This is a beautiful resort right on the end of the strip (before the Stratosphere). It is new and beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The staff are warm and friendly. We are HGVC members already, and bought another week while we were there. It is really close to all of the major casinos but there is not a casino at this resort. That was very nice as it gives a nice break from all the hustle and bustle and smoke, yet you are still very close to all of the action. We will definitely stay here again.	
+	Aug 25 2006 	Would make this my "regular" hotel in Vegas	This is a great hotel for non-gaming adults. You will enjoy the flat screen TV, mini kitchen and granite countertops. It is in a pretty good location - on the north end of the strip between Circus and Stratosphere. You will avoid the noise, kids (although there were families) and 2 mile hike through the lobby that many of the other hotels on the strip offer. FULL DISCLOSURE OF NEGATIVE IMPRESSIONS:There are 1 1/2 restaurants. One by the pool (which is very nice, btw) and a convenience store type restaurant downstairs. There are no fine dining options and/or a lot of variety in dining. This is the 1 true negative of the hotel. For me, this meant that you could not &quot;live&quot; in this hotel. You were compelled to venture out.Self-park can be limited - forcing you to pay the daily valet charge ($6). I did not personally experience this, but it is clear that the rooms outnumber the parking spaces. Still, I thought this was a great hotel at a good price and I only observed a couple of alternative hotels that would tempt me away.	
+	Mar 24 2008 	Best stay on our trip	March 20-22, 2008After traveling around for 10 days, we arrived at the HI Express. We were pleasantly surprised at how easily we found the hotel and were even more pleased with our room. We were greeted quickly and checked in right away. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and after driving from the Grand Canyon, they were very welcome. We were far enough off the road to have a quiet room but close enough that if you wanted to, walk to the Strip. (several blocks away), but why, when there is a convenient shuttle to take you to the MGM or the Mandalay Bay Hotels.Breakfast was a bit above average and filling. It was busy, so we kept having to ask when the muffins or juice were going to be refilled. There was a bit of a wait, since they had only 1 person staffing the breakfast. It was good and filling, a lot of variety.My only complaint is that there was trouble with the internet, which did get corrected and the front desk offered to print out our boarding passes if we needed.The AC in the room was a bit loud, but was efficient, if my son didn't keep messing with it.	
+	Mar 6 2007 	Good  but..	Having stayed at Holiday Inn Express in Detroit and Solvang, California, I knew that the one in Las Vegas would be a pretty safe bet. But I must say I'm a bit surprised that Tripadvisor members rate this as the 3. best hotel/value in Vegas. The rooms are perfectly fine, and the staff is friendly and efficent. I agree with most of the positive comments about the hotel, but here's why I can't give this hotel more than three points:1. Some advisors say that the noise from the airport isn't that loud. All I can say is that that depends on in whitch direction the planes are taking off. If they take off over the hotel the noise is quite bothersome.2. The AC - at least in my room - was very loud.3. In a time when many budget hotels in Vegas offer 42&quot; flat screen TVs, HIE still has old school TV's. And the reseption on mine was pretty bad on several channels. 4. The location. I desided to stay at this hotel because I wanted to stay off the Strip. But the area is dull, you can't walk to the strip, so you do need a car. Unless you want to spend money on taxis, or wait around for the shutle that runs to Mandaly Bay every half hour until midnight that is. 5. The price is good, but not great, compared to other great off strip deals like The Orleans or South Point. However there is one thing the others can't beat HIE on - the beds. I'm a regular visitor to Las Vegas and have stayed at more than 10 different hotels. Only at Paris have I been as comfortable in bed as I was here. And a room at Paris cost twice as much.The Holiday Inn Express is a safe bet for an off strip hotel. But be aware that everything is not as perfect as some advisors seems to think. Have a nice trip to Vegas - and good luck.	
	+	Good choice off the strip	Stayed in a two bedroom suit with four adults total. Each room had its own bathroom. There were nice 32 flat screen TVS in each bedroom and one in the living room. Room were clean and looked nice and modern. Hotel staff was helpful and friendly. The free continental breakfast was good. Hotels location was good if you have a car. It is only about a Mile to the strip and there are a lot of choices for dinning and shopping within a mile of the hotel. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel.	
-	May 23 2008 	Ok for the Price	My boyfriend and I stayed at Hooters and we were basically willing to accept anything for the awesome price. The price was good and we figured it was just a room that we slept in while we aere there. The problems seem to outweight the good and I am a pretty easy going person. The AC in Hooters was sooo loud and clanky. It kept both of us up all night. Secondly, no one is ever winning at the slots. Thirdly, the carpet is absolutely horrible in the rooms and the hallways. At times there was even the smell of vomit. YuckService at Dan Marinos and Hooters sucks! The food was great, but, each time we waited at least 10 minutes at our table before we even got acknowledged. The Owl Card- Wow....what a joke! For some reason they are never really able to tell you what you can get for comps as far as points go. Their was an earn 20 points and get 10 in cash reward. We did this and they cashed us out without telling us that we loose all our accumulated points to get an owl and other perks. They even have a 100.00 slot play that they advertise all over the place. The problem is that they have an area roped off and you are restricted to playing there with the 100.00. Their are about 8 machines and not a one ever paid out while we were there. We did see comidian Bobby Slaton which was awesome and our Owl cards paid for the show. Watch out for the drink prices though! We ordered 1 captain and diet and a second one as a double. The price.......27.00! Needless to say, we spent a lot of time at the MGM which is right across the street and very fun! I would say this hotel really needs to work on customer satisfaction. I most likely will not be back.	
-	Jan 18 2008 	I wouldn't recommend	Was not pleased with this property. We were here on business and had to pick a place close to our event. All around this area were wedding chapels and people walking. It was kind of scary. Everything here was small. The bathroom, you were barely able to get into and the one queen we had was almost at the dresser at the end of the bed. I just felt cramped in this room and wouldn't really recommend unless you have no choice.	
-	Jan 15 2008	Beware the jet noise	When the wind shifts the hotel is directly under the departing flight pattern for way to close McCarran Airport. At midnight we decided to give it a count, 6 flights taking off directly over our hotel in just 10 minutes. The rooms depicted on the hotel's website are a generic representation of an average room in the Hyatt Place chain, not an actual room at the Las Vegas hotel. The rooms in Las Vegas, rather than having a screen separate the two portions of the room had a 4'X5', floor to ceiling divider that housed the in room air conditioner (loud) which also made the area around king bed much smaller.This place does not deserve the Hyatt name and is no where up to the standards of Marriott's Residence Inn, Fairfield or Courtyard chains. Okay, the large LCD television rocks, but it did not makeup for the rest of the issues.	
	-	Cheap rate good location nothing more.	Booked IP for a quick one-night stay at a very low rate. Wasn't expecting much, but still disappointed. Probably the most uncomfortable bed I've every experienced. The room, hallways, and casino were worn and dirty. Front desk staff and casino personnel all seemed fairly competent. But I would've been miserable here for an extended stay. Tip: If you stay here, request a room far away from the Rockhouse Bar, otherwise you'll be hearing thumping bass until early morning.	
-	Nov 13 2009 	my daughter;s wedding	the place is a joke they trea ted my daughter and her new husband with the most disrepect. From a maid going into their room when a do not enter sign is on the door. topeople going in and breaking their belongs. And being escorted out like criminal. Don'tget me started on some one stealing money from one of guest, valet leaving the door toanother guest car ajar running down the battery and then threaitng them with having their car towed to bath tubs broke and other guest putting do not enter and staff going in any way if they can't read english send them back across the border.	
-	Oct 22 2009 	Read for a true review - Stay away	A request for a room close to the elevators for a handicapped guest who has difficulty walking leads to a room assignment of the LAST room at the end of the hallway- the furthest away from the bank of elevators. Wallpaper peeling off the wall Dirty carpets Worn furniture and bedding A bathroom sink so worn the enamel is almost none existent A bathroom tub that takes almost an hour to drain after a shower A bathroom tub that drains to well from the floor above into a guest room across the hallway at 4:30 A.M. - check your records on 10/13 - creating a disturbance to all guest as shop vacs and workers endeavored to clean up the mess ! The later explanation given by one of your supervisors (according to his name tag) was that the Oriental people use the bathtubs to do laundry and that they left the water running. Hence the name Imperial Palace I guess !Noise...Noise...Noise...Noise.Only 4 elevators that run about as fast as dirt - leading to guests waiting 25 to 30 abreast and 10 to 12 deep and pushing and shoving when a car finally arrives at the casino level. People wedging open fire doors to stairways with room towels rather than waiting for these elevatorsA blinking message light on the phone in the room leads to a message stating that there are no messages in your Meridian voicemail . There were however 18 long stem roses for an 80th birthday celebration that were never delivered-that this message was supposed to refer to. Only when the sender called and asked about his gift, were we made aware that your staff had tossed a package clearly marked FTD live flowers into the back room and they would send someone to look for it.A parking garage that requires a GPS system to reach...up...down elevators and escalators and a 5 minute hike...ridiculous !Being propositioned by hookers in your shopping areaWatching your security guards escort one of these ladies off the premises as another one -tossed out not 15 minutes before walks right past them and back into the hotel !!! Check your security log at 6 A.M on 10/15	
-	Jul 31 2009 	NEVER AGAIN !	Our first time to Las Vegas.. Expecting something wonderful from the reviews that had been previously read on this site.. Couldn't have been more wrong!The whole Casino-Hotel needs a facelift.. Lifts slow and often out of order.. Ice machines aways empty as with no mini fridge's in room (unless you pay an extra $10 a nite) ppl bring their eskies and fill them up with the ice..leaving no more ice !!! Food avail in the Hotel limited..No buffet breakfast,, Staff tired and overworked..Wallpaper comming off the walls, skirting boards kicked in with no attention to repair.. Pool area small and over-crowded no cover from the intense heat of July.. Perfect for young ppl who don't care about a little comfort.. As for us, and everyone I spoke to while staying there.. We will never stay here again..and I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone ..	
+	Jan 15 2009 	A Room with a View	I was a little skeptical about the reviews I had read prior to booking my stay at the Jockey Club but decided to go for it anyway due to the low cost. Some friends and I share birthdays in February and decided to meet up in Vegas for a little get together. The Jockey Club is next door to the Bellagio and across the street from Planet Hollywood - excellent location! After checking in we arrived to the room which was supposed to be a one bedroom and ended up with a two bedroom suite with a kitchen, dining room, living room with pull out sofabed and two bathrooms. To top that off the rooms were facing the dancing fountains at the Bellagio. Awesome! Although the furniture is a little dated, the accomodations were still very nice and clean. I was able to peek into the rooms across the hall and they were more modern but they did not have the view that we had from that side of the building. This property is basically for time share owners however they do accomodate other clientele. There is a pool and fitness area, also you can go downstairs and rent DVD's if you just want to relax. We ended up staying in one night as a friend had to much to drink and instead of leaving her we stayed in and watched movies. Since we were there for a week we knew we had time to go out on other nights. We took in some shows - Zumanity -erotic show (Cirque Du Soleil), Queens of Las Vegas (longest running drag show in Vegas and Mystere (Cirque Du Soliel), don't forget Madame Tussauds Wax Museum next to the Venetian. Also the Forum Shops At Caesars, the M &amp; M factory for the kids and the Harley Davidson Store where you can pick up some cool biker t-shirts are in walking distance from Jockey Club. Since I believe the City Center has now been erected, the construction next to the Jockey Club should be less. Although some people complained about the construction noise in the other reviews, we barely heard anything. We all enjoyed our stay.	
-	Jan 19 2007 	Beware	If you are trading a 5 star timeshare for a week at the Jockey Club beware. This is just a hotel room with a kitchen and bedroom...what I would consider a Jr Suite at most hotels.We traded a Westgate 3 bedroom for a 1 bedroom (they claimed it was all they had).  Although the hotel claims it is non smoking the smell of smoke is all over. They do construction 21 hours a day right outside your bedroom window. Taxi's refuse to come thereWe ran out of toilet paper and had to call 3 times to get more	
+	Nov 17 2006 	Incomparable view and super comfortable suite!	We are timeshare owners with Interval International Exchange and we traded our beachfront Florida unit for a week, November 7-14, 2006, at the Las Vegas Jockey Club. We knew to request a one bedroom suite on the Bellagio side and had to wait a few extra hours to move in, but - my-oh-my - we had a view from the 10th floor that was AMAZING!! We could watch the Bellagio fountain shows, and even hear the music, as often as we wanted! We also could see the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel from our comfy king-sized bed each night! The full kitchen was equipped with everything you could possibly want and there was a dining table already set when we arrived!There were two large TV's, 2 DVD players, a nice stereo system, great climate control, a nice bathroom with tub/shower and everything was kept in spotless condition. Maid service was available every day. We were so very comfortable and enjoyed every minute of our week's stay! We could walk to just about everything on the strip (and we did!) We even walked one morning down to the famous 'Welcome to Las Vegas' sign south of the Mandalay Bay Resort. Or we could catch the bus at a stop right at the entrance to the Jockey Club. The staff was very friendly and helpful and we were not bothered by the construction noise from the massive mega-projects - Cosmopolitan and City center - being built to the south and west as we were in the front (Ascot) tower facing north and on the second to highest floor. We loved our oasis from the hustle and bustle on the Vegas strip and would highly recommend a stay at the Jockey Club. In fact, we liked it SO MUCH that we are currently negotiating to purchase a week of timeshare from a private owner. This is DEEDED property right in the heart of the Las Vegas strip on Las Vegas Blvd. Sounds great to us!	
-	Jan 1 2009 	Nicer than Strip Hotels but too far from Las Vegas Blvd	While visiting family in Las Vegas, my boyfriend decided that we would try something a little further than the strip as opposed to other years where we usually stay at Bellagio, Venetian, MGM. Our room was defintely more aesthetically pleasing and more elegant than our relatives rooms at the Bellagio and New York-New York. The bathroom was HUGE with a jacuzzi tub, amazing shower and the bed was soooooo comfortable! The room also was very nicely decorated(which may or may not affect others when choosing a resort). We also opted for prepaying Breakfast Buffet for 2 every morning and it was definitely worth it! Although breakfast buffet closes as 11am(which is hard to make if you party all night) the food is very good and the prepay price is way cheaper than it would be paying at the time of order!HERE ARE MY COMPLAINTS:All travel websites state that High-Speed Internet Access is Free and it is not. It is $9.99/day. They pitch you at the front desk to purchase a &quot;Resort Fee Package&quot; which includes 1 bucket of golf balls per day, Internet , and one pass/person to the fitness center and spa; all for $25/day. Also, if you plan on spending time on the strip and getting home late this hotel is about 12 miles driving distance from the strip and traffic from the hotel to the strip is horrendous! It states that the hotel is only 5 miles from the strip which may be true distance wise but driving there is 12.2 miles on the freeway and you're stuck in traffic most of the time(aside from the hours of 12pm and 7am).All in all it is a nice hotel but next year we will be staying on the strip so it is more convenient. If you aren't planning on visiting the strip very often then I would definitely recommend this hotel!	
+	Sep 3 2008 	Nicest Hotel I have Ever Stayed At!	I am a Marriott employee, so I have had to luxury to travel to amazing destinations at a discounted rate. For the last two years I have created a grading system based upon the JW Marriott, Renaissance and Marriott's. Hands down, this is the nicest hotel that I have ever stayed at! It was truly amazing! The rooms were incredible with the jacuzzi style tubs, rain fall shower head, ceiling fan, french doors and private patio.	
+	Nov 13 2007 	Not one bad thing to say	I have nothing negative to report about the JW Marriott. Everything from check in to check out was just great. Quiet area of Vegas, which we liked. We can visit the strip and return here away from the crowds, ect. If you like the Strip action this is not the place for you.	
-	Jan 11 2008 	Harshmy ladyfriends first night in Vegas..	Thought we got a deal with a good rate..but sometimes you don't get what you pay for. Room had a musty odor,carpets were stained..ceilings also.We were awakened by the kids hanging around the pool area at 3 A.M to the sound of profuse vomiting.Fortunatley we were only staying one night..We stayed at Treasure Island for the next 6 nights..what a night and day difference. T.I. was wonderful!	
+	Dec 22 2003	Great room	For $78 on a Saturday night, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I plan on staying here again next time I visit Vegas, even though it isn't located on the strip. The room was lovely, very clean with a fridge, wardrobe, jacuzzi tub, coffee maker. (Starbucks right across the street though lol) Great value overall.	
+	Nov 6 2003	Great place to stay in Vegas!!!	I booked a last minute trip to Las Vegas to celebrate my friend's birthday. Well, I initially told him I couldn't make it because I couldn't afford the weekend rates hotels charge on the strip. But then, after a little bit of internet research, I found the Las Vegas Club Hotel, located right on the Fremont Experience!! $27 for a Saturday night, $19/night for Sunday and Monday! I couldn't believe it! One thing I liked about the place was that it was easy to find my way out, not like the maze that the larger hotels tend to have to intentionally keep people from leaving.	
	+	Excellent hotel	The pyramid was the most awesome experience. The &quot;Inclinators&quot; are an experience every one should try at least once. The decor is awesome and the clubs and restaurants are 5 star. The shopping is wonderful, especially if you are into Egyptian art and artifacts.	
+	Sep 1 2009 	Wonderful stay	My husband and I recently came back from Vegas staying at the Luxor, this is the first time we have stayed here and I loved it. I have stayed at the Imperial Palace, Excalibur and New York New York but the Luxor was very impressive, especially the lobby and registration area. The machines and tables are placed well apart from each other, not crammed together like the other hotels. Even though the Luxor is at the southern end of the strip it is no problem to walk the connecting bridges to the other casinos or catch The Duece down the strip to the others. I found that there is quite a variety of eateries to suit all pockets, we especially liked the Pyramid Cafe for breakfast. I found the staff helpfull and the machines were kind to us. I would recommend this hotel to others, we will be coming back next year. I can't wait..	
+	Feb 6 2008	Good value hotel	Recently, my wife and I stayed at this hotel during the month of January 2008 since it offered a very affordable rate and we enjoy the casual gaming atmosphere of Downtown, Las Vegas. Would definitely stay here again.Pros:· Great location to get on &amp; off of the freeway (I-15 &amp; 93/95)· The room was clean, very affordable and the offering of oatmeal face soap in the rooms bathroom was a nice touch.· Garden Court buffet is an excellent value.· Triple 777 Brewery has excellent food, I recommend the onion rings, deep fried mushrooms and the ribs. If ordering oysters then make sure that its fresh· Cocktail server in the casino will take about eight (8) minutes to return with your drink order. In my opinion, 8 minutes is not a long· Free viewing of the Berlin Wall although it is located in the mens bathroom holding up the urinals or beside the urinals.Cons:· The noise coming from the freeway and trains can be a bit load at times, especially if you are a light-sleeper. Being that I was so tired, it did not bother me one bit.· The omelet station at the buffet will often have a long wait time of approximately 7 - 10 minutes.· For those slot &amp; vp players, the wait for a scratch card will take in excess of 5 minutes to obtain and the wait times are even longer in the early morning hours. Yes, it is worth the wait since the casino claims that a $5,000 scratch card does exist.· Did not see an elevator in the self parking lot though there may have been one so I had to use the stairs.	
+	Oct 9 2009 	Great pool area for whole family.	We chose the Mandalay Bay for the pools. The wave pool is great for toddlers since it has a shallow area for wading. Preschool on up can enjoy floating on the lazt river for hours. The hot tubs are fun for all ages too. Bring your own innertube so you don't need to spend money on renting or buying one at the hotel.The only downside of the hotel is the prices for food. Quite expensive to feed a family of 4 but it is the same at all the nice Vegas hotels. We bought some snacks and beverages at the local drugstore to save money.	
-	May 15 2009 	understaffed inconsistent quality overpriced food and drink	this beautiful facility is a true mixed-bag. the rooms are very comfortable and clean, but details let them down. the beds are wonderful, but the lamps are cheap and flimsy. the bathrooms are large, but the towels are sandpaper-like and smell unclean. the casino is way understaffed, with few change or service people. some of the slot machines are faded and filthy. the restaurants are no better than your average chain, but the prices are 2 or 3 times higher than you might expect to pay for the same food at your local eatery. still, the mandalay bay is a beautiful building, and the staff are friendly and helpful. the problems are all indicative of the economy and the cost-cutting efforts of the hotel. just don't expect very much, and you won't be disappointed.	
-	Apr 11 2006 	Mixed bag		
-	Jul 27 2009 	Not so great	It is off the Strip and is a little old. The restaurant has limited items and the waitress who served us was bordering on rude, but the food was very good. While most of the breakfast was good, when I reached for a doughnut I found fruit flies climbing in or out of it. While the layout of the room was great, the tile in the shower was cracked and broken in one place. As a platinum member, I was asked if I wanted the space of a lower floor suite or a suite with a view on a higher floor. I chose the view and ended up with a suite that faced away from the Strip. For what I paid, I was expecting much more. Just a little disappointed I guess. I think this would be a great place to stay in if you are visiting Vegas on business.	
-	Jun 4 2007 	never stay here	We have just arrived from las Vegas.If you are travelling for visit never stay here. First it is really like 4 blocks from the strip. Street is lonely, near low category hotels and many solicitors. I have stayed in many marriotts (fort laud. aruba, cancun, miami, orlando etc.) This is the worth.We stayed for 7 nights and our room was not clean up three times. The first time I called they said the privacy card was outside, (not true) We went out about 11:30 am. The second time it was very late, I called the manager. He was so rude. So next day I called customer service at marriott and they talked with the manager who call us to talk with us. We explain this lady what happened. You wont believe it that night when we came back (our last night) the didnt clean the room. AMAZING!!!!!The pool is really smalll, we never use it. At night when the dinning room was close.It is near the elevators it really smells bad like food or grease.Only one person at reception,No bell manThis hotel really was a disaster for us!!!!!	
+	Jun 24 2008 	Thrilled to find the Meridian!	Compared to other upscale resorts we've enjoyed, the Meridian is truly the best for overall value and accomodations. The staff was wonderful and the security is excellent. The two bedroom suite was gorgeous, immaculate and it exceeded our expectations. The grounds are beautiful and we loved the 24 hour pool. We'll definitely stay again.	
+	Apr 11 2008 	Luxurious and Hidden	This property is a luxury resort with the convenience of condo living. This does not feel like a hotel at all. More like an upscale condo resort with gated manned security, underground parking, fully furnished suites (with everything you could ask for), and an absolutely lovely tropical pool/spa area. The security guard at the gate was wearing a tux and white gloves when we arrived. The check-in area is a small office and very personal service is given ( not the lines like in the big casinos). The suites are very large with tall ceilings. We stayed in the two bedroom unit which had a washer and dryer in it. Stainless steel appliances, leather sofas, upscale bedroom furnishings, granite, private entrance, private deck, two bathrooms, elegant chandelier, large plasma TV, and more. I have stayed at almost every large Casino on the Strip and although this property is one block off, it is the ONLY place I will stay in future.	
+	Oct 8 2007 	Lovely apartment	This was by far the most luxurious and the cheapest accomodation we had stayed in throughout our holiday/vacation. We booked a 2 bed Platinum Suite for 3 adults and it was swish!! Leather sofas, plasma TVs, mirrored walls in lounge, huge fridge/freezer and cooker. You could easily cater for yourself here on the odd night. I made use off the washer and dryer as we were halfway though our vacation. They even left us small packets of soap powder. However, it was dusty and our balcony furniture was particularly dusty but we wiped it over ourselves even though reception offered to send someone.For me I hate elevators and high rise, so this was PERFECT! It was a good 20 minute walk to the Strip but I liked the fact we were off strip and it was a secure, gated community. I used the pool - not crowded at all, plenty of loungers. The Staff were happy to phone for taxis and when we were stood up by a taxi driver on the one night we had show tickets, the Manager even offered to drop us off to the Mirage himself. When I offered a tip to the desk guys - they refused! They certainly have plans for this place and I would definately go back without hesitation.	
-	Nov 20 2009	old and cheap	MGM Grand is an imposing structure in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. This was my first time staying there, and the hotel and casino is less than impressive. The room was clean enough, with a large bathroom. I did not add a credit card to the room at check in, and was unable to do that at any point later during my stay - the lines at the front desk were very long, and the hotel does not allow to do that over the phone. However, the TV is old beyond belief, small screen with very poor picture. There are approximately 5 channels, many of which show Vegas advertisement. The lighting in the room is too much for a romantic low-light, and not enough if one wanted to read, or work, or even comfortably try on clothes. The only mirror available is in the bathroom. Light fixtures are also old and ugly, and plug in into equally old electrical outlets, in near-desperate need of repair. The radio-alarm clock rivaled ancient specimen typically found in the middle-of-nowhere motels. Enough about the room, lets talk about the hotel itself. The lions are impressive, the lobby is huge, and the buffet looks like your typical elementary-school cafeteria. Dance club Studio 54 looks like its ambiance hasn't been updated since 54 years ago, although the DJs were doing a great job. Sparkling water could only be found at one bar, plain wanter available at others. The Italian restaurant with the desert decor (there is no desert in Italy) had some interesting items on the wine list. Getting service took forever, the food was unspectacular and not worth the prices. The casino is middle-of-the-road - some spots have more smoke than others, some dealers are nicer than others. Slot machines	
+	Aug 25 2009 	Great location on the strip comfy simple room	We stayed at the West Wing on the mgm and loved it! Lemme just say these rooms arent for everyone. They are not as spacious as the regular mgm rooms and not for everyone. The deco inside is very hip and modern and appeals to the younger vegas crowd I think. I loved the room and felt very comfy there. The bed was comfortable and big. The shades in the room left absolutely no light in. TV was flat screen with dvd player and I loved that the mirror in the bathroom had a tv screen in it which I enjoyed watching while getting ready. Like I said these rooms wont appeal to everyone so if you're looking for bigger rooms , go elsewhere. These rooms while hip and modern are still VERY functional and nice! The West Wing also offered a lobby bar that was also swank and low lit with an easy exit to the strip that makes it just a few feet away from it! Also had a Starbucks next to it. I would definitely book in the West Wing for another stay because of the value, comfort, and location!	
+	Oct 9 2009 	Vegas Baby!	The staff at the Mirage were always very helpful and curteous. The food at the restuarants was wonderful as well.We enjoyed seeing the volcano &quot;come to life&quot; at night and really enjoyed Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden exhibit. The pool at the hotel was beautiful. Overall, we had an excellent trip.	
+	Oct 3 2009 	Las Vegas is Fabulous!!!	My friend and I visited during the weekend of the Meriweather fight. It was a Moms' Getaway/Birthday Weekend and we had an awesome time! We really didn't want to be around a bunch of Cancun/Spring Break-types, but we did want to have a lot of adult fun! The hotel is very nice; fancy without the atmosphere being snobby. The atrium and aquarium gives it a very tropical feel. It complimented the overall ambiance of the hotel. They need to have someone cleaning the entrance glass doors throughout the day. All of the smudges can throw off your first impression. I just love the fact that Vegas never sleeps! Definitely a playground for grown-ups! Check-in took about 20 minutes. I asked for an upgrade and was told that it would be $15/night extra. It would have been nice if it would have been complimentary considering it was our first time in Vegas. We did get comp. tickets to Secret Garden/Dolphin Habitat by booking online through the hotel. I wouldn't spend full price for that either, but it was enjoyable. We also got a $40 food credit that we used our first night for dinner. I wouldn't suggest Cravings Buffet if paying full-price. The food was tasty, but I thought there would be a bit more choices in food. My favorites: spring rolls, prime rib, cannoli. It was fun people-watching! The Carnegie was just too overpriced! Go to Fashion Show Mall and eat lunch at the food court.We loved the room! We were on 23rd floor facing Treasure Island. It would have been great to view the Strip, but the view of the mountains every morning was beautiful! Housekeeping was ok; the room was straightened up and I had to ask for extra towels and wash clothes. We saw the volcano the first night - very entertaining, but how many times can you watch it and still be amazed! Hang around about 15 minutes before the show starts to get a nice spot by the railing. It was on our to-do list and enjoyed it. It would have been nice if the internet service was cheaper! The charge was $14/day! Needless to say, we didn't get it. If you have it on your cellphone, use that. I loved that security is posted by the elevators in the evenings and ask to see your room key before letting you through.The casino was just that and the stale, smokey smell took some getting used to. Most of the casinos smelled like that so don't hold it against them. I loved the slots! The drink ladies take forever to come back after you get your first drink (free of course). You have to be at the tables betting your life away to get steady drinks. The pool was very lush! The pool staff needs to work on customer service and act like they're not being disturbed during their side conversation. They are young kids - summer job thing so don't expect much from them besides where to get a towel. The pool area could use some music. The waterfall was beautiful. It felt like a resort pool.We weren't thrilled with Jet nightclub. It was our last night and we got downstairs about 20 minutes after the complimentary entry time of 12:30a. We didn't know that they offered that and were pretty snooty about not letting us in even though we were patrons of the hotel. Rude! Tao at the Venetian was fun!Walk around and browse the stores, the atrium and the grounds in general. The night time is beautiful and taking in the hotel sights is a nice way to slow down for a moment. Take the tram that connects Mirage and TI; it'll save you some steps on the way to the mall. Walgreens is across the street at the Venetian - great for cash back (ATM fee at Mirage is $4.99), souvenirs, basic necessities, snacks. I would definitely recommend this hotel for atmosphere, cost, location (further south on the Strip look a little bummy).Make sure you call service for shuttle pick-up to the airport the night before your departure. Also, don't forget to get your cash from Walgreens the night before. We used Grayline bus shuttle ($6.50).	
+	Aug 13 2009 	Great Time @ Mirage	Stayed there in June had a great stay kids loved the gardens and the animals and the Mirage is so central to all Vegas has to offer.Highly Recommend the Mirage to young and old !	
+	Aug 7 2009 	20 somethings on a budget - good fit!	The Mirage is in a great location and for a group of friends traveling for a bachelorette party it was perfect. However, there are much fancier places out there on the strip. If you are looking for a sleek, sexy, modern hotel, then this probably would not be your first choice. But if you are looking for a decent value, great pool, and a starting place for all your Vegas adventures, this is a great choice. Notes- - The pool is great, with pretty good service for drinks and food. Lots of young, fun people to hang out with. People crash the Mirage pool from other hotels (even though you need your room card to get in to the pool area) so get there early if you want chairs. Have a Miami Vice - you will not be sorry and you'll enjoy your little &quot;nap&quot; by hte pool afterwards!- The staff are very helpful and accomodating. We booked a bunch of rooms and one suite on the same floor (for 15 girls) and all of them smelled like an ashtray, and they could not move us to a non-smoking floor (I can't belive I forgot to indicate non-smoking when I reserved the rooms!). But the janitor and security people we encountered while trying to get everything fixed were really accomodating, and they fumigated the room, so it smelled like Febreeze instead of smoke, which was only slightly better. It was my fault I forgot to reserve non-smoking rooms so I can't get mad, and they really did try to help. The $10 tip to the janitor was like giving him a $100. Really nice guy.- The Spa was beautiful, again, really nice people, but the treatment (facial) was just so-so. It was so relaxing, however, it was hard for me to get pumped up to go out that night. Guess I wont be visiting a spa in Vegas again.- The best clubs are not in this hotel so you will have to walk a bit to get to them, but the Venetian and Tao are right across the street. You can cab it or walk in flats to the other good spots.- The casino here is fine, it is not as pretty as the Wynn (so gorgeous!), fancy as the Venetian, or as modern as MGM Grand or Planet Hollywood, but the minimums are lower than some of the pricey hotels. I would go gaming somewhere else so you can experience another hotel's vibe, and play here only if I had some leftover cash I didn't mind parting with while killing some time.- The Italian restaurant here is tucked away in a corner and is really beautiful, would be a great place to retreat from all the noise, etc. Food was quite good as well. We loved our meal at LAVO in the Venetian, though. - The breakfast place outside the pool entrance is a walk-up coffe counter and bagel place. It was always super packed and super slow, probably the low point of the trip. But the Mirage is close to the mall where there is a decent food court (with a good Greek gyro place) so you can always go there. Or pay a little estra for breakfast by the pool, it is probably worth the extra $10 for your meal when you don't have to wait in line for 25 minutes. We did not do the buffet, probably a good option but more expensive, and eats in to your pool time.- We did not have updated rooms so the decor was just average. The bathroom was nice, though. I would make sure you know what kind of room you are getting and double check it so you get what you want.I have stayed here and at Treasure Island, and I would definitely recommend this over TI. I would go back if with a group of friends, but for a more romantic getaway, I would do a nicer place. Also, if I went with family, this would be a so-so choice. There might be more places that cater a bit more to young kids. Mirage had a very 20-something traveling on a budget feel to it. it would be nice for couples on a budget as well.	
+	Jul 5 2009 	Great stay at the Mirage	First time staying at the Mirage, room was real clean, great location. Staff was friendly and helpful. Sorry did not take any pictures but no complaints. If you want a great sandwich at the deli do recommend it for sure. Buffet was unreal pricey but delicious.As far as the rest of Vegas goes all depends on what you make of it, every time I go I am making plans for next my next trip there. I hear lots of people saying how pricey Vegas is, for water, drinks and food ect. there are so many deals out there so do you homework before you go. I would stay here again no question just want to check out the other hotels just to do so. We went last weekend of Nov seemed to be a bit of slow time for Vegas and not a lot of huge lines ect. compared to the busy months.	
-	Jul 1 2009 	Not all that	The location of this hotel is good. The rooms were small.The only poor service i would elaborate on was the hair dryer had stopped working and someone came to replace a new one on the wall (at a bad time). They were to come back and never did. So the remainder of the visit I had the dryer sittin on the counter. The room was plain as jane. The bathroom fixtures were old. There was nothing elaborate about the room. You had to pay for the internet and local calls. The money taken in of this place is spent in the casino and making it look appealing on the outside. I wouldn't stay here again.	
-	May 17 2009 	Why can't drunks stay home	This was the 2nd time I stayed at Monte Carlo. Very nice hotel, however, my party and I were on the 13th floor and unfortunately next to several rooms of partiers that shouted obscenities all night - drank, talked very loud - slammed doors and pretty much were very wild. I believe it was a fraternity or sorority group. I called to complain after 1 pm one night as I feel you can have a good time without waking up other guests, without shouting obscenities, etc. Our final night was awful as the same loud group came upstairs around 3am swearing and making loud noises. When we left our rooms around 4 am to catch our plane, we noticed the wall hangings on the walls were ripped down and broken on the ground. Maybe Monte Carlo needs to have better security to silence these folks that think Vegas is only about drinking and being rude.As for the rest - the buffet was very good - the Brand Steak house was good - but pricey. Nice DJ pool party - only the pool closed at 6pm - what's up with that?	
-	Mar 31 2009	Stay somewhere else!	A beautiful hotel, great location and large rooms are the pluses for this hotel, but if you're willing to pay for a less than clean, noisy room, dim lighting, $15.00 a day internet connection, and no coffee pot for those who 'gotta have it!', then do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else!	
+	Mar 11 2009	Darn good value	Two couples (over 50, but hip) spent a week in Vegas in February. We have stayed at the Monte Carlo before and were confident in doing so again. We were not disappointed since it proved to be the same value as in years past. The rooms were clean and while not the Ritz Carlton, they were just fine. The lobby is very pretty and we got some great deals on stuff at the gift shop. Look for the 50% off shelves. Our only gripe was the construction noise. There is a HUGE project going on at the rear of the hotel and those guys start really early. On check-in, be sure to ask for a room on the east side of the hotel. Be specific about wanting to be away from the noise. We felt that odd numbered rooms on any floor would not be directly adjacent to the racket. All in all, we had a great time and would stay there again.	
+	Feb 27 2009 	Great deal	Spent 2 days of rest and relaxation at the MC. Got a great special that included drinks, fitness center, and buffet all included. Room was fine nothing special. I will say that construction starts early in the morning. Really wasn't that bad I had asked a room away from the construction. I will say that I did have a good time in the casino, the cocktail remember my drink each night which is like old Vegas! Table games were not over priced even on Friday night, played Let it Ride for $5. Check out was great no wait did via TV. I would highly suggest the MC for a quick stay!	
+	Nov 14 2009 	Great hotel and even greater with a players club card!!!	I have been to Vegas many times and this time I took my wife. We checked in around midnight so check in was fast. They didn't have the room we requested at the time of check in but i called down in the morning and we were upgraded that afternoon to a room on the 21st floor. It faced the MGM and was great. We heard nothing at all even with the people next door living it up!! so I am not to sure what people are saying abou the thin walls. This was the 5th time I have stayed at the NYNY as with the players club card that give me great rates weekdays and weekends. The one thing I am dissapointed about is no buffett BUT a short walk over to the monte carlo and the buffett there is GREAT!!! I have stayed at many a hotel buy NYNY has earned my loyalty. The pool was not to bad but when we went down around 1-2 it was pretty busy but hey it is a 2-3000 room hotel so it was expected.	
+	Oct 8 2009 	Fun place with lots to do!	I took a trip here with some friends for a friend's 40th birthday bash. We had a great time! This was our 2nd time here, and we were not disappointed. Room was very nice, with a great view of the strip. The only drawback was it was a bit of a hike from the elevator. Very nice casino, and some great restaurants and bars in house. Coyote Ugly was a blast!! It was a great choice for a &quot;homebase&quot; for our Las Vegas stay.	
+	Jul 4 2009 	Amazing hotel but could be better	This was my third trip to Las Vegas and I wanted something a little different from the same old, same old hotel, mainly because I was taking a friend who had never been to Vegas before. So, of all the hotel/casino's on the strip, the only one that really stands out is NY-NY!Check in was relatively painless, but then I had already booked one of the best rooms in advanced. The room was fantastic, with a large LCD TV, two huge queen sized beds, a large bathroom with shower, safe and limited cupboard space. The room was attractively decorated in neutral colours and the beds comfortable.The hotel/casino it self is amazing, with a cut down version of New York, with loads of fast food outlets, a few bars (Time Sq is probably the best) and restaurants. However, as the ceiling is painted black, the lighting low and with crazy coloured carpet, it can feel a bit depressing and will make you want to get out and go to another casino after a short time.As NY-NY is at the southern edge of the strip, it is a bit of a walk to get to places such as the Bellagio, but fairly easy at the right time of year.All in all it's not a bad hotel, would recommend it, but don't ask the desk to do anything more than just checking in or checking out, especially if you lose something.	
+	Jul 1 2009 	Turn back time	I usually don't write Trip Advisor reviews for chain or generally well-known hotels since I doubt I can contribute much that hasn't been said, but am reviewing the NY NY in order to note that it appears to have gone slightly downhill in the last few years. I stayed in the NY NY once in 2003 and it was great - exactly on par with the Paris - one of Vegas's really fun &quot;theme&quot; hotel/casinos. I stayed again in 2009 only to find best part of the casino area had been completely ripped out (the Central Park themed bridge and trees) and replaced with abstract gaudy neon swirls and a pit of slot machines. The New York theme was pretty much lost as a result (though once you venture out of the casino area into the restaurant section, the theme becomes evident again with the tenement style buildings, delis, pizzarias, etc.). The rooms are spotless but haven't been updated (e.g., projection TVs). However, the price did reflect this decline (at $79, the room was about $40 cheaper per night than the Paris).As an aside, it seems like Vegas, generally, is moving away from theme hotels/casinos like the NY NY, Paris, Venetian, etc. to just super-luxury (the Wynn, etc) and the action is moving further north on the Strip.The bottom line is the NY NY was a great value (very clean with good location and fair pricing), but it's a bit disappointing to see it starting to decline, even if the price has been adjusted accordingly. By all means, stay there for the value and gamble elsewhere in a more fun/luxurious environment.	
+	Apr 5 2009 	Clean Tidy and well located	Stayed here for 3 nights in July '08. Would recommend. It was clean tidy and very safe. The room was of a very high quality. Perhaps not the most expensive hotel on the strip but we weren't looking for that and we got more in the room then we were expecting. The staff were extremely helpful especially the front desk who provided us with anything we need.	
+	Mar 8 2009	Follow up to	A very nice rep from New York New York read my review and took the time to find me. I received a email so I called. She was very sorry this happened and said she would make sure that the clerk and Manager would be address and this would be brought up in meeting to work on Customer Service. She offered a comp room for my next trip and asked that it be offer to a guess at random. I just wanted to be heard.Thank you.	
+	Mar 13 2009 	Just needed place to stay for night ended up loving Palace Station!	I was coming back into Vegas after vacationing there the week before and heading out to Utah. I had a flight the next morning and just needed a basic place to stay and relax for the night. I looked on several hotel sites and couldn't resist booking Palace Station for under $20. I was aware of a $10.85 amenities fee which included the use of the pools, fitness facility and high speed internet. I was okay with that because I did want to work out and use the internet, which would have cost me double or triple that amount in other hotels. I booked a courtyard room which was not a part of the towers. They require a little walking to get to. I didn't expect much but I felt the room far exceeded my expectations. In the entryway of the room is about an 8 foot section of tile. This is an area to keep bags if you would like. Off to the right is the bathroom. The bathroom is of average size, with a shower only. The showerhead was one of those really large rainfall type deals which was really pleasant for me. The bed was comfortable. The TV was a flatscreen, not the wall mountable type, but large and with a quality picture nonetheless. My room overlooked one of the pool areas. My room was on the second floor, and since I had a lot of stuff and there was no elevator in the courtyard rooms I asked a bellman for help. He carried all of my stuff, had straps going every way possible in order to carry everything. He was such a nice guy. Infact everyone at the property was extremely nice. I had a coupon for 25% off room service so I gave it a try. Room service prices were surprisingly high for this property. The food was just average and it took a while to get, so I can't suggest ordering room service. Overall the rooms were nice and clean and just what I needed for the night. I was so impressed with the property that I plan to stay there on my next trip. Their rewards program for gambling is very generous, so I would like to mostly play there in the future. This property is off the strip, so it is not an ideal destination for those without cars or those experiencing Vegas for the first time. The shuttle they used to provide for free to the strip apparently costs $5 each way. This just happened to be ideal for me because I had a rental car and am a frequent visitor.	
+	Oct 22 2007	We were very happy	Flew in with a family group for a wedding. Palace Station has its own shuttle service so we were taken directly to the front of the hotel without any stops along the way. The shuttle driver pointed out places of interest and gave passengers advice on getting around the city also answering questions. Check in seemed slow considering very few people in line at that time however all employees were helpful and pleasant. Our rooms were in a block on one end of the 6th floor Tower section. Everything very clean and welcoming. Some of the rooms looked out towards the strip and the mountains but the rooms on the other side had a view right into the parking garage. One member of our group had a medical emergency in the night and we were promptly attended to by security who assisted with transfer to a hospital. Housekeeping was excellent. We ate at the various restaurants in the hotel and enjoyed the Grand Cafe the most. They also have a Starbucks and a Burger King just off the casino area. Did have a longer wait on Saturday evening to get taxi service. This was a nice low-key hotel not as hectic as some of the bigger casinos but we were more than satisfied with everything.	
-	Apr 24 2007 	Very expensive for what you get	My husband and I stayed at the Palace Station for the weekend April 20-22, 2007. We booked a King bed, non-smoking suite. We paid extra for the suite, but when we checked in and went to the room, it was a standard room, double beds and smoking. I called the front desk to ask for a King room, but I was told none were available. My husband then got on the phone (with the same person) and all of a sudden they had a King room available. We did pay extra for a suite and the first room was just a standard room. Both rooms were smoking as no non-smoking were available and both rooms were really smelly. I used to be a smoker so I can deal with some of the smell but these were bad.I have to say, the second room was larger and had a whirlpool bath, but I feel the hotel tried to &quot;dupe&quot; us with the first room. Of course that experience left a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak.The casino restaurants and buffet were all excellent and great value for money, but for a nicer and cheaper room off the strip stay at the Orleans.	
+	Mar 6 2007 	A nice Suprise	Date: March 6 2007Reviewer: Chicago visitorJust got back from a four day stay at the Palace Station. I felt I needed to report on my stay as before I went I read some pretty bad reviews.Went with my mother and brother and sister-in-law for our annual Vegas trip. We all had courtyard rooms, which though small were very clean and more than adequate for the time one spends in their room in Vegas. Since we all slept like rocks, I do not believe there was any noise issue. My brother and his wife are both over 6 feet tall and had no problem with the shower heads that many complained about. The halls were always clean, no room service trays blocking the floors like two years ago at the MGM. The staff was very friendly and helpful. In fact when my mother ordered oatmeal for a very late breakfast the waitress advised against it as it was late and the oatmeal would be several hours old. We ate several meals at the cafe and they were all very good. Myself I did not think the buffet was that great, but I tend to not like buffets anyways. The food was fresh and there was plenty of variety and the prices were great. However I would rate it as typical rather than spectacular.We took the shuttle only to the Airport when we left and again, no problems.All in all I would stay there again; we had a very good experience.	
-	Oct 3 2003	Okay but some problems	Just came back after staying at Palace Station Oct 1 and 2/03 Definitely will not be going back! Pluses - great price $20.00 - Buffet - average, Cafe was OK - quick check in and out - shuttle available Negatives - extremely smoky interiors - corridors are a bit dark and dank - insides show age, wear and tear in the courtyard rooms - air conditioner and bathroom fan very very noisy due to their age - air pollution due to heavy smoke	
-	Nov 4 2009 	BED BUGS	Checkin on sep609 at 7pm to celebrate my 40th birthday.Woke up sep0709 with an itch which became worse as the day progresses and developed in to a red rash.Decided to seek medical atten on sep0809.The clinic which was recommended by the hotel wanted to charge appx. usd350.00 pp.We spoke to pharmacist located in the clinic who adved it looed like bedbug bites.Return to hotel and adved above and requested assistance with medical bill.They refused but decided to change room because 'it would make us feel better&quot;.We had to seek our own medical assistance even though the trained EMT the hotel sent to our room also said it looked like possible begbug bites.We decied to deptart las on sep0909 because of the terrible pain and itch and the embarresment of scratching in public.The hotel decided to still bill us for the entire stay.The lack of assistance and help and the lack of customer service was appalling.	
-	Sep 19 2009 	Do not stay at Paris Las vegas!	We came to Paris Las Vegas on our anniversary and have been so disappointed from the begining. The key from the King Luxury room we booked in advance we never got. After walking around for 3 hours, we came back at 9pm and the room still wasn't ready and we got just a stardant room with a pool view. (We think the room was clean but somehow they didn't want to give it to us). I came down 3 times to get my King Luxury room keys and the lady worked that night talked to me so depreciatingly, started argue with me. She even ask me if I have a problem with a standart room? Yes, of course I did. All my plans I had that night went out and only one nice thing to remember about this stay is because we went to Ceasars Palace. Was beautiful!We do not understand how staff can work at the places like this without any smile, talk to us so unrespectable. We are coming to Las Vegas to rest and have fun after flights all day long and expecting a liitle bit more attention. If your staff can't do it, then it's a time to review your enployees.I really got hurt by a lady worked that night. I'll never ever come to this place again!I'm living in this beautiful country, but this experience I wish to forget because of the some person not care about doing a job well.	
-	Jul 8 2009 	Very Tired Hotel with a crappy spa	We checked in late and had to wait as we had supposedly already checked in, got upgraded to a suite which we thought would be nice, but room was not clean, very dusty. Had room service one day and dishes stayed for two days. The spa is the biggest rip off, if you want to waste your money, try the slots, at least you may walk away satisfied.	
+	Nov 19 2009 	Great - but	Nice hotel, dined in Koi restaurant which was stunning but very expensive, access to Miracle Mile shopping centre very convenient, and also Bellagio, Paris, Caesars Palace Hotels etc just a few minutes away. Also great shopping at fashion Plaze about 10 minutes walk down the strip. Only downside was hotel rooms very dark - literally needed a torch to see, but extra compfy beds	
-	Sep 3 2009 	An absolute disgrace.	This hotel was absolutely horrible. My mom and I decided to go as a belated sixteenth birthday present for me. We were staying on the eighteenth floor in a Hollywood Hip Room. The room was extremely dark. The sink did not drain properly and one of the lamps did not work. Maitenance promised to send someone at 1:00 pm the next day. We got up, got ready, cleaned our stuff up, and went out. We returned that night and discovered that the lamp still did not work and the sink was not draining properly. We also found that the bathtub had not been cleaned (I had used it the night before), and none of the tables had been dusted. My mom called again and they said they would fix it in the morning. The next morning, we were upgraded to a resort room with a strip view. The room was much bigger, brighter, had two vanities in the bathroom and was much nicer. The next morning, we slept in and took our time getting ready. We placed the do not disturb sign while we were asleep. We changed the sign to the housekeeping one before we left. We came back at about 4:00 and discovered that the room had not been cleaned. We received a message from housekeeping asking us if we wanted the room clean. The person my mom spoke to was extremely rude. They said someone would be sent up shortly. We left for dinner and came back at about 10:45. The room was still not made. My mom called again and a maid was sent up. She was extremely nice and was apologetic, yet she trash-talked the employee my mom had spoken to on the phone. An absolute no-no in a professional environment. Because of this, my mom asked for a late checkout. The next morning, we decided to order room service. My meal was good, although extremely large. My mom ordered a breakfast that included pancakes. The pancakes were disgusting. They were cold and hard. We called downstairs and were greeted by rude people. We were disgusted by the way we were being treated so my mom demanded that we have the internet fee removed and the room service fee removed. We got those and we got a Starbucks credit. This hotel was a big disappointment. It was dark, old (even with the renovations), expensive and had terrible customer service. First time to Vegas, but definitely my last time to Planet Hollywood.	
-	Sep 2 2009 	loud and noisy not for the over 40s	if you like loud music 24/7 this is your place .young girl on reception talks like minnie mouse ,booked a fountains view room when we arrived minnie bluntly told us none avalable sink blocked in allocated room for two days would not recomend	
-	Jul 22 2009 	Not the best dark rooms a lot of miserable staff and crappy pool area!	We stayed here from July 12 to 16 and here's my comments on the place, from start to finish. Check in was quick, nobody there but us at 10:30 pm at night. Nice big room, but like everyone says, very dark! The beds were cozy and the curtains made the room super dark. Only two drawers in room and they are obstructed by the bed, so you can't fully pull them out. Closet space is a bare minimum. Not the friendliest of staff, everyone in every part of the hotel seemed miserable..... Drinks at the pool were over $8.00, take your own drinks to the pool, they say you can take only one in, but if you fill your water bottles with your own stuff they don't care, no glass allowed in though. If you don't get to the pool when it opens, you won't get a lounger, they have a big deck that's like a parking lot that you just bake on, then you have to walk on the hot concrete about half a block to get near the upstairs pool.... Maid service was good, my friends two doors down though didn't get any room service for the first couple of days because the maid told them they thought the room was empty!! Check out was fast you could do it through the phone, no seats in the lobby or anywhere for that matter unless you sat in the casino at a table or machine. It was 112 degrees outside and they told us to go and sit out there to wait for our shuttle bus, I tell ya!!! Beware of the timeshare people in red just inside the doors to the casino, they get you every time you walk in and out. Construction area going to be starting out front to the left, lots of garbage being thrown in this area. Spice Market Buffet was good, but pricey! You make you're own fun, so have a good trip and for a nice pool try MGM Grand or Flamingo.	
+	Jul 16 2009 	Amazing hotel 10 out of 10!	We booked our trip through Thomas Cook and flew with Virgin Atlantic. The flights were brilliant (excellent times!) and cabin crew were spot on with everything. We got a taxi from the airport which cost about $15 (plus tip) and check in at the hotel was quite quick (about ten minutes). Because we had booked with Virgin we were automatically upgraded to a better room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. Unfortunately, my hair staighteners didnt work when i tried to use them but the concierge located in the lobby did everything he could to try to fix mine and when that didnt work, he found me another pair i could use. the hotel has a funky, grown up feel to it. we saw very few children and the staff are all very helpful. You will get used to the time share people- just say no thankyou and they leave you alone. we booked a trip to the Grand Canyon with Pink jeep tours and it was amazing. we were picked up on time and the guide was very very funny, helpful and full of information!we ate in Planet Dailies a couple of times (ok prices). the Earl of Sandwich and the spice market buffet for breakfast ($14.99)- all located in the hotel. however, we discovered that the Bellagio breakfast buffet was $14.50 and just across the road so we ate there more often as the choice of food was amazing!!! we also tried the mgm grand buffet but that wasnt very good. it had a poor selection of food and the queues were huge! we visited many attractions when in vegas- Ka at mgm was amazing, the dolphins and tigers at the Mirage are nice, shark reef at Mandalay bay is great, tournament of kings in Excalibur made us say 'huzzah!', madame tussauds at the Venetian where i got 'married' to george clooney- to name a few! we also watched half of the sirens show at ti- only half because it was soooo awful. we made the decision to walk from our hotel to the las vegas sign too, which considering it was very hot that day was not the best idea as it is quite far. however, it is worth it! there are people there who will take your photo for you but of course you have to tip them. id recommend just getting the next person in the queue to take your photo and you do the same for them. we ate at the cheesecake factory in caesars palace which was excellent and well priced, Planet Hollywood restaurant in Caesars was also good, but the best place we ate was the dinner buffet at the Bellagio- such an amazing choice of food and it wasnt that busy!overall, planet hollywood is an amazing hotel, we were very lucky with the room we had. there is also the miracle mile shops below the hotel which are open till late. visit the abc shops for anything you need- i often sent my boyfriend to get snacks such as milkshakes, twinkies and fresh melon!this hotel is also fantastic because of its location- smack bang in the middle of the strip. you can easily walk to mgm, new york, luxor without realising how far you have walked. to walk as far as wynn takes a bit longer but there is always the choice of the monorail which is great when its really really hot, particularly at night!	
-	Jun 21 2008 	Amazing Facility Terrible Staff (Read On...)	Frankly, this would have been the best hotel I have ever stayed in. And that's saying a lot, as I've traveled 9 months a year for the last 7 years. The rooms are amazing, really huge and comfortable with all the amenities you could ask for: jacuzzi tubs, washer/dryer, full kitchen, all great stuff. All this for around $100, it's really hard to believe. The location is decent, you can walk to the Monorail and the Strip, but you're far enough back no tot have to deal with the traffic and headaches.I think the &quot;valet parking only&quot; idea is crap, frankly, I am more than capable of parking a car, even in &quot;one a dem parkin geerages.&quot; But hey, they have limited space and I don't think they charge for the service.Now, here's the big 'ol problem. It's bad enough that I would probably not recommend the place to anyone else. A group of us traveling on business booked six rooms. One of our group doesn't travel much, so his company credit card gets used only once or twice a year. Within a day of checking out of the Platinum, the only place where he used the card in the past nine months, fraudulent charges start popping up--online purchases delivered to PO Boxes. Another member of our group was mysteriously charged an extra $150. Another guest had his rate changed at checkout time without any explanation. Me, I had a $14 charge show up with no explanation either, after I checked out. Four out of six of us having to call either the hotel or the police due to activity related to the hotel seems to be more than a minor problem, it seems systemic and perhaps even sanctioned. It seems hard to believe they can't be aware of the problems.If you stay, you may want to try this instead: use a website where you pre-pay your room, and provide a cash deposit upon arrival. The bonus upside is that when you leave Vegas, you'll at least go home with your deposit!	
+	Oct 22 2007 	Excellent value and great service.	My wife and I stayed at The Platinum for 3 nights in early October.This was our first time in Las Vegas,and the recommendations to avoid booking accomodation on ` The Strip ` proved to be well founded !! The Platinum is one block off the centre of the strip.It takes no more than a five minute walk to the front of The Bellagio,Caesars Palace or Ballys.We booked a one bedroomed suite which for two people was more than adequate.The suite had a full kitchen , Whirlpool / spa bath, lounge / living room ,two LCD televisions and a balcony with the most stunning view of Las Vegas you could imagine.(we were on the 16th floor !)The staff from the front desk ,the car valet guys and the restaurant and bar staff were exceptional .Nothing was to much trouble, even to rhe extent of a waiter coming to our room to open a bottle of wine for us as the cutlery tray was missing a corkscrew.The pool area is on the fifth floor and after some serious sightseeing and shopping it was a relaxing area to unwind at the end of the day,before hitting the nightlife of `Sin City`.The sunbeds were fully matressed,with a further selection of other reclining chairs and sofas on which to enjoy a drink from the discreet poolside bar.The restaurant stands comparison with most four star hotels.The food is excellent and seriously well presented but be prepared to pay that bit more for it along with the service.The bar staff were absolutely brilliant not only at creating some wonderful cocktails but giving us the inside information of how to have fun in Vegas.Overall I cannot rate this place highly enough.It may be a block off the strip but is actually closer than if you were staying in the further reaches of somewhere like Caesars Palace or The MGM Grand,	
+	Oct 10 2007 	Family-Friendly Awesome Rooms Perfect Staff... A+	One minor thing I'd suggest up front if you stay here and you sleep lightly -- try to get a room that doesn't face Flamingo Ave. The windows are double-paned, but even from the 9th floor, ambulances and &quot;loud pipes&quot; did wake me up a few times the first night.I never would have considered this off-the-strip hotel if not for its rating here on TripAdvisor, and boy am I glad we checked with TripAdvisor, because this was the best hotel I've stayed in for this price (and for considerably more). First, it's a suites-only timeshare. Before you stop reading, this is not a sales-pitch for a free stay kind of time share -- the units are already owned, and they're rented out like a regular hotel. Except the rooms are very spacious, they have full-size refrigerators, a small dishwasher (which housekeeping runs for you if you use any dishes), real hair dryers and irons... almost like home. We stayed in the smallest of their suites, the Solitaire. It was quite ample for me, my wife, and our four-year-old son, who slept on the pull-out sofa. You can check out the Solitair floorplan on the Platinum's Web site [---]The staff is the friendliest I've experienced, and the on-site restaurant is excellent. We arrived Sunday night about 12 hours ahead of our bags, so when we showed up at the restaurants in rumpled clothing (me in a Tee Shirt), I didn't expect to be greeted with smiles and the most gracious and friendly service of our whole stay in Vegas. The food was marvelous, and we took our &quot;doggie bags&quot; upstairs to the fridge for a late-night snack.The hotel is very close the the strip, but given the crazy Vegas traffic I was glad we had the rental car so we didn't have to manage crossing the intersections on foot. The hotel has valet-only parking, but they were always quick and courteous.Anyway, we had a marvelous vacation and it was in no small part due to the Platinum and its great staff.	
+	Jun 30 2008 	Great stay at the Plaza	I booked this hotel for $28.00, I booked a petite suite, but upon check in they offered me an upgrade to the Penthouse Suite!! The room was huge, 2 queens beds, a Bar, living area and a sizable bathroom. The room did show it's age, the furniture was chipped / scratched, but very clean. I recall the carpet was light pink and so thick you stepped into it! This was my second stay at the Plaza and I would have no problem going back.	
+	Oct 12 2006 	GREAT TIMESHARE IN VEGAS!	This was my first visit to my timeshare at Polo Towers ( as I'd bought it over the internet) and I was very nervous after reading some of the reviews. I needn't have worried, my timeshare was on the 16th floor with a great strip view and was fabulous. The 2 bed unit was very big and very clean. The staff were very helpful and I had no problems, or cause for complaint, throughout my 10 day stay. Also, the pool was very nice and, again, very clean. I have stayed in most of the strip hotels over the years and it compares very well with the Luxor, Flamingo Hilton and Caesars Palace, except at Polo Towers you also have the added advantage of a full kitchen.I can't wait for my next visit.	
+	Dec 30 2008 	Gigantic and Fancy	This hotel is great. All in all it was an incredibly luxurious experience. It's fancy, clean, nice furniture, nice nature picture decorations. We stayed on the 10th floor-got a free upgrade to a bigger room. It was huge and clean. It had an enormous bath tub and a tv to watch while you are soaking in your bath salts. The view was amazing. It was a strip view-at night, the lights from the strip made a great backdrop. Housekeeping was very thorough. The people at the front desk were friendly and answered all my questions. If I wanted to, I didn't need to leave the hotel-swimming pool, bowling, food court, gambling, bars, restaurants, spa etc...but my husband and I really wanted to go to red rocks park to climb. It was very close to the hotel-easy to go back and forth from. The second night we went to the strip. Driving to it was easy and we found free parking right away. Only two things annoyed me-1. the free shuttle to the strip stops shuttling pretty early at night, so it is not something to take if you want a night out on the town. But if you have a car, it seemed easy to park on the strip so it worked out okay.2. The casino owns everything, of course. So when I tried to be cheap and get breakfast from the Starbucks in the hotel with my gift card, I found out that the Starbucks does not take gift cards or Starbucks credit cards. They want all your money!I would definitely stay here again for my combo night on the town/climbing all day experience. I got the hotel for 90/night not including lots more money for the casino tax and resort fee-i think the total was 250 for 2 nights.	
+	Aug 4 2008 	Rockin' It Like a Rockstar at Red Rock!	My first time stay at the Red Rock Resort for two nights was awesome. Modern and tastefully designed property with all of the amenities you could ask for at this chic off strip hotel &amp; spa. The place is huge, a world within itself without the cheesiness that permeates Las Vegas. The room was super clean and quiet, beds comfortable and the views of the strip were amazing. I requested a quiet room and was promptly accommodated on the 17th floor (did I mention that the view was fantastic through an entire wall of floor to ceiling windows? The spacious room included a a large flat screen TV, deep soaking tub with a second, smaller flat screen in the marbled bathroom. Service is there when you need them to be and respectful when you want privacy. Food options abound, ranging from an inexpensive food court, two buffets and high end sushi and steak house. Several stylish bars, a night club and of course, the casino were all equally welcoming. If gambling is not your focus, the Red Rock offers a 14-plex movie theater, bowling lanes and an arcade for the younger family members. I was incredibly impressed with the pool scene. Good music, colorful towels, lounge chairs and cabanas were all arranged in a circle around the main pool, sporting numerous additional pools throughout. The spa has its own pool and lough area, which makes it nice for those who want a little distance from families with children. There is a bar complete with misting to keep you hydrated while sipping a wide variety of cocktails offered on the menu. The casino and hotel are both easily accessed from the centrally located pool area.The hotel spa was impressive and you automatically gain access through your resort fee of $20 a day, which gives you the opportunity to not schedule a treatment but still use the spa.Red Rock Resort offers free, prompt shuttle service (it's actually a small bus) to and from the Airport every two hours. A cab will cost you $55, depending on time of day and traffic. My wake up call was right on time and the bellhop, front desk and concierge staff were all friendly and helpful. You can arrange to go for hikes, bike rides and kayaking a short distance away in the Red Rock National Park area. I didn't get to take advantage of this so I can't review the activities.You can't go wrong staying here. A few things to keep in mind though: The pool closes at 7 or 8 PM and staffs security who will oust you from the area if you are there after hours. I would like to see the resort offer an area where you can sit outside and chill, AWAY from the casino in the evening. Also, the mini bar and snack tray have electronic sensors. As is typical in Vegas, you touch, you pay.Red Rock Resort is a fantastic alternative to saying on the strip!Go Rock it!	
+	Feb 5 2008 	Wonderful modern hotel..	Because it's Las Vegas, this Renaissance was a Marriott category 5 and cost me 46,000 points! Ouch. If you book the hotel with points, I'm pretty sure the confirmation page states that you get access to the Conceirge Level, so make sure you print that page out! (The email confirmation does not mention Conceirge Level). The room was very modern and clean. The flat screen tv was smallish, but sufficient. The bathroom was big, the tub small, but we loved the clear glass shower. I'm attaching photos.We rented a car and there was free self parking at the hotel. Getting around (driving) is not that convenient, coz you can only turn left out of the hotel (concrete barriers). We had to take back roads to get back onto the strip.	
-	May 27 2005	Not worth the money	My husband and I just got back from Las Vegas and were less than impressed with the hotel. The first night we got there we had to move to 3 different rooms before we got the right one. And dealing with that late at night after a long flight is not something you want to do. This is after we had called earlier in the week confirming our reservation and room. The next day, we ventured off to the strip to come back to our door to our room opened and all our belongings missing. After 45 minutes of complete chaos, the hotel realized they accidently checked us out and the cleaning staff took our belongings when the cleaned our room. The secuirty, though, was more than helpful with the entire situation. We did get all our belongings back with nothing missing. One day during our 4 day stay there, they never cleaned our room. It was near 5:00 and we had to find a cleaning staff on our floor to get fresh towels. The pool is very small. And by 1:30, it's in complete shade. Needless to say, we will never stay there again. We expected much more for the money we spent.	
-	Apr 17 2009 	Very Disappointed	As I'm typing this I'm on hold to get a receipt (25+ mins). I'm not one normally to write a review about bad hotel experiences, I usually just let it go but this cannot go ignored. I travel 5-10 times per year and this hotel had the rudest staff I had ever encountered, the room was not very up-to-date, the TV's color faded in and out, I had charges to my room that I now have to dispute, and my room was not cleaned one of the nights I stayed. Other than that the trip was okay. :-)	
+	Oct 7 2007 	Wonderful hotel--too bad it's not on the strip	My husband and I just got home from a weekend at the RIo. We occasionally get offers/free rooms from Harrah's hotels and the Rio had the best deal for the timeframe of our trip. It's been 10 years since we've stayed here and I think the property's changed for the better. We were on the 16th floor of the Ipanema tower in a newly renovated room. I loved this room (not a suite, however much the hotel chooses to call their rooms suites). You first walk into a small marble foyer with a refrigerator/coffeemaker nook then straight into the large room that held a large corduroy covered sofa, a very comfortable easy chair, a marble topped coffee table and a good sized work desk. The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable and had soft linens and a duvet. The bathroom had a pedestal sink--it was separated by a door from a larger sink and vanity area. This area also had a built-in chest of drawers and large closet. All in all, I'd say this was one of the better designed and most comfortable motel rooms I've stayed in for a long time. Some Vegas hotels, like the Venetian, have larger rooms (ie suites), but this was so livable and nice to come 'home' to at night. The room itself was sparkling clean and very convenient to elevators.I liked the Rio's layout. It's not huge so it's very easy to navigate. The little sports cafe connected to the Sports book had good food and it was easy to grab a bite or take it up to the room. We had late night breakfast in the All-American Grille--pretty inexpensive. We also ate at the Seafood Buffet our first night there. The slipper lobster was soooo good. At $36.95, though, it's pricey.I was pleasantly surprised at the drink service while gambling--no joke, friendly servers came around at least every 5-10 minutes, even around the penny machines. Slots were no tighter here than anywhere else--in fact, I won $500 on a dollar machine our last night there.The Rio has it all--except for location. Honestly, that's the deal-breaker for me. I felt like we wasted a lot of time searching for and waiting for shuttles to the strip. Gave up a few times and sprung for the $10 (with tip) one way cab fare. We love casino hopping when in Vegas and like the option of going back to our hotel room for little breaks in between during the day. This just isn't feasible at the Rio. Darn--I really enjoyed this place but we probably won't be back unless offered free rooms.	
-	Jan 9 2007 	Very Bad Customer Service	Hi Friends, I would like to advice u guys never ever opt for this Hotel Customer Service is really bad,I know it's the cheapest hotel on the strip but u save nothing much as all amenities are charged,so finally u end up spending same amout so instead stay somewhere near to mid strip and enjoy the stay.only restrooms r free alse all services are charged they don't at all care for customers.Don't ever go to the &quot;SynCity&quot; nightclub in this Hotel it sucks big time.	
-	Jul 27 2005	Once is Enough	We used the automated check-in instead of waiting in a long line and ended up with a 2nd floor room in the Sam Remo tower with no view to speak of. The room was larger than I expected and appeared quite clean. It was a smoking room (that's all that was left), but it did not smell of smoke. There is a vanity with a teeny, tiny light above it that was absolutely useless. The light above the entryway was also pretty useless. The bathroom counter had plenty of space and there is a cabinet under the sink for storage. There was no hairdryer so I was glad that I packed mine at the last minute. The bath towels are horrible, thin things. There was black mold on the ceiling above a bed, and I saw a cockroach running along underneath the bathroom counter. It was 115 degrees when we there so we only went out in the evening until early morning and slept during the day. We put a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, but housekeeping never failed to knock on the door and wake us up to ask if we wanted our room cleaned that day! We ate at the coffee shop twice and had good food with large portions. We had a 2 for 1 for the buffet so we tried that, but it wasn't that great and I would not go again. I will not stay at this end of the strip again. The only highlight of our stay at this place was my hubby winning $850 at the Let it Ride table!	
+	Feb 18 2004	riviera great in my book	we stayed at the riviera for 3 nights feb9-12 2004 we loved it we went with another couple staff was very cordial they made you feel welcome rooms were clean they gave us side by side rooms we had a little problem with the heater but they fixed that right away pit boss and dealers were great especially willie&amp;john also enjoyed jay white as neil diamond great show but a bit short i am just glad that we went and did not change our mind after reading some negative reviews it not the venetian but for the money it can't be beat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
-	Aug 19 2003	use to stay here not anymore	i have stayed at the riv at least 8 times, and have always gone out with a group. our groups have been the minimum of 26 people and the largest being 54. you would think bringing out a group that large and being one of the people who arranges this that the hotel would at least take care of the people who brought out this many people to gamble at there place. WRONG&gt; the riv is not that great a place so even getting an upgrade to a bigger or better room would not be all that great since the rooms there are old and worn. but in all the times we have gone out i have never complained and never asked for a thing, even though i have done alot of work to get all these people together collect the money etc. last time there i had a filthy room, and was grossed out. i complained for the one and only time to a pit boss i knew there. he got a hold of someone who could have helped me and told him we were big gamblers and that i arrnaged these groups to come there and explained the situation to him. not only did i not get a well deserved upgrade, i did not even get moved out of the dump of a room i was in. i spent the whole vacation in that crappy room. i wound up never taking the group back to the riv we moved our party over to the stardust instead where they take great care of us. we are by no means whales, yet were not low rollers either. we figured it out that everyone on our trip on the whole bought out a thousand a day to gamble. we go during the week so it is not like the hotel was full and they could not have given us a small upgrade etc. also this place besides being tired looking and looking very dated, the rooms are a disgrace, it has now turned into slot player haven, forget the table games anymore. i dont understand how the riv which when we started going there use to get there fair share of high rollers went so far down hill. on one of our trips there they had a guy take them for something like 50,000 dollars it was like the place was going to go bankrupt or something. all the help was talking about it and they lowered all there table limits to 3 dollars to recup this way no one could hurt them anymore. needless to say we dont go to the riv anymore and now you can see why people dont go there or go back the casino stinks, the rooms are crappy there is not reason to go there anymore. like i said went there 8 years in a row and for the past 4 we have never stayed there or for that matter even walked in the place. if you go there good luck, about all they attract now are low roller, drunks, white trash, and besides there steak house, all there eatting places also suck. dont even go to the buffet it is the nasty food you ever will eat.	
-	May 13 2009 	2 Night stay with Newmarket travel Group	HIWe stayed at this hotel for 2 nights 5-6 May 2009. Having read the reviews before leaving we had mixed feelings of what was in store for our visit. The outside of the Hotel as a Moorish feel to it like being in Tunisia. When you enter the hotel at the rear off the coach the first thing that strikes you is how dark and unwelcoming it is, carpets are worn and it reminded me of entering an old betting shop. The room was ok but like other reviews have stated very worn. The room had 2 double beds , colour TV No coffee maker or fridge. The bathroom was OK with adequate towels and Gels. The Pool area was nice with a good choice of varied music to suit most tastes. There is a pool bar to the left hand side and tou can fill your water bottles at the 2 Urns next to the bar. Drink prices were ok but cocktails around 9 dollars a bit pricey. You can buy drinks from the shop just inside from the pool area cheaper (Take Note). The main Buffet was OK with a good variety of food and if you join the free membersip rewards club you can have the buffet for half price around 8 dollars. The Caravan restaurant is good for breakfast again around 9 dollars for a full breakfast with toast 3 dollars more for coffee.Beware of the fist restaurant as you come in from the coach entrance between the gift shops opposit e check in desk, it is i think expensive.The Monorail runs from here 13 dollars for a 24hr all day pass every 6 minutes, a very efficient service but bear in mind you will need to walk at least 800yds from your arrival point to get to where you want to go so if walking is a problem get a taxi and ask them to go off the strip if it is busy as this will reduce the cost. It will be around 15 dollars in a taxi to the centre if they go off the strip or 30 dollars if it is busy on the strip.Overall the hotel is OK a few of our fellow travellers got flooded out with sewage whilst we were there and had to move rooms. It would not be a hotel i would choose to go back to but the pool area was nice. The rep is advising Newmarket to change from this hotel next year but i have tried to give a balanced view of how i saw things.Hello to all on our trip between 24April and 7May starting in SanFrancisco.Dave and Diane	
+	Mar 31 2009 	Incredible value - fabulous resort hotel	I may be very late in providing comments, but I just had to do it. My stay at Sams was so great it is the reason I will plan a new trip to Vegas as soon as possible. Although a few miles from the strip, it doesn't matter because they offer free shuttle bus service to all the main areas. We had our car and didn't need to use it. Check out their website for all they offer. Everything was great, food, service,gambling, entertainment options, etc. etc. etc. Forget about staying on the strip. Price is unbeatable.	
+	Mar 29 2008 	Incredible Value	I chose this place because we had a car and didn't necessarily need to stay on the strip. We thought it was clean, very large rooms and the staff was nice. The steakhouse was delicious with large portions. I would stay here again if I had a car as it is 2 miles off the strip.	
-	Nov 13 2005	Service better but...	I have been here two months and will stay until the end of the year. rooms are good and clean, pool is good and staff is pretty good depending on who you talk to. First night floor above me squeeked and they moved me to the top floor. The TV was snowy and they prommised to fix it. after a week and three complaints they moved me to another room and it is perfect. My only complaint is the TV service NO FOX NEWS, MSNBC, or CNBC, Only CNN and CNN headline news. They will not even talk about getting other channels. They raised prices 60.00 a month to give you free long distance service, which I have free on my cell phone. But, compaired to the other extended stays in Vegas, they are the best for the money. Some close by are really bad and the same money. Closer to the strip there are better ones, but much higher prices.	
+	Nov 4 2009 	Oasis in the Circus of Las Vegas	We rented our condo through www.vrbo.com and received a great weekend deal. It was Halloween so the city was crazy busy and it was wonderful to come back to the quiet and clean of our hotel after being in the madness. The room itself was on the penthouse levels (floors 33-38) and the room was exquisite. The bed was extremely comfortable, the television had High Definition channels, the bathroom was huge with a TV and jacuzzi tub and the view was amazing. The condo had a fridge, stove top, microwave and mini-bar which was perfect for heating up the leftovers from the huge portions given in the Las Vegas restaurants. The resort's amenities were basic but understandable with the MGM being next door. The pool areas were outstanding with comfy loungers, clean salt water pools, and free towels and water. The resort fee was included in our rate so that wasn't a concern. I read that a lot of folks complained about the walk to the strip. I do recognize that it is a journey to Las Vegas Blvd, but after all of the Coronas and calories consumed, I looked at this as a good thing. Get a monorail pass for 3 days and that will save you a ton of walking.I would not hesitate staying at the MGM Signature again. This resort is one of the best I have ever stayed in.	
+	Oct 17 2009	Spacious luxurious good service nice views are all here.	We stayed in Tower 1 which is more convenient to reach the casino and restaturants. The suite was really spacious, and VERY well appointed; TVs in the huge bathrooms; fridge toaster stove etc in the kitchen. We got a good deal before we went, but upgraded on arrival for an additional cost.. While we were very close to all the nightlife of Vegas, it was very peaceful and quiet in the suite. However, the internet is not really free, not when there's the $20 resort fee each day. The staff were helpful, but I would not say exceptional.	
+	Oct 3 2009 	Still the Best	We've stayed in Tower 1 before so we again selected a one bedroom suite there. We love the upscale apartment feel, especially having 2 bathrooms.We registered at the airport which was fast, easy, the people were friendly and we will definitely take advantage of that again. We do not recommend taking the shuttle from the airport. It took an hour for the guy to tag our bags and walk us outside to wait for the airport shuttle to then get to the hotel. We later realized we paid more to do that than to pay for a cab. Our cab ride, for 2 people, from the hotel back to the airport cost $15, including the tip.The distance from the Signature into the MGM Grand may seem far depending on your mobility. I hurt my ankle the 2nd day there and it felt a lot furthur being in pain than it did the day before when I was pain free. Even with that I would stay at the Signature again as everything about it is perfect. They have plenty of cabs outside the lobby if you don't want to walk anywhere.We ate most of our meals at the Studio Cafe located inside the MGM Grand. They have downsized their menu due to the economy bringing fewer people (according to a manager) but we still loved it. The food is wonderful both in quality and quantity. Be sure to ask if they have any specials before you order. And if you go for breakfast between 6 - 8am ask for the Grand Breakfast special. You'll save $6 off the cost. We were there at that time ~ due to our time zone/ body clock difference ~ but didn't know about the special so we paid full price for not mentioning it in advance. Everything we ordered was delicious and counted toward our $75 resort credit. The fish and chips were great and the chocolate milk shake that came with the burger sliders was the best we'd ever had.We saw 2 shows. 'The Jersey Boys' we bought tickets from the concierge. The seats were great and we loved the show. It is an older crowd that was there maybe because Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons belonged to that generation. We loved it but we're not sure our children would love it quite as much. But we highly recommend it.The other show was the Cirque Du Soleil 'Beatles - Love' we bought tickets from a discount place close the MGM called 'Tix 4 Tonight'. We saved money and got good seats. However, you need to know that when they give you the voucher for the show you have to take it to the box office in advance and they assign the seating there; which means you will either walk or taxi over costing you time or money the morning of the show. If you don't get there as early as possible there is a possibility that you won't get 2 or more seats together. It worked great for us and we loved the show! The Tix 4 Tonight office is right by the giant Coke bottle by a place called Gameworks just a block down from MGM.We also went to the Titanic exhibit using Tix 4 Tonight voucher and had no problem walking up and using it immediately. The exhibit is really interesting and I still can't believe I saw a real portion of the ship.My husband said that although he likes Las Vegas it wasn't very nice to him. When he came home and paid $10 for milk and bread he said it was nice to get something for his money instead of the guy just taking it and giving nothing in return like happened this trip. However, when he decides to forgive Las Vegas, and we come back, we will stay at this wonderful, clean, quiet, upscale place with a great staff. We would highly recommend it to anyone.	
+	Aug 11 2009 	If going to Vegas - stay here!	Never travelled to Vegas before and chose this hotel because of reading previousTrip Advisor reviews - certainly wasn't disappointed. Very calming atmosphere - quick efficient check in - not witnessed at many other hotel receptions! Suite was very spacious, clean and all very tastefully decorated. Kitchen had full fridge. Two bathrooms - one enourmous one with jacuzzi bath and large shower - granite throughout. Lounge area with large TV and bedroom with most comfortable bed.- It has an covered air conditioned walkway to get to MGM Grande but this is really not a problem.- It is down one end of the strip but this is also not a problem - too hot to really walk anywhere anyway so just walk out of the hotel and jump in the immediate taxi that arrives!Quite different from any of the other hotels we looked at mhile we stayed in vegas but we enjoyed that fact. No huge casinos to walk through to get to your room but the better for it I think. Lots of those to choose from!Travelled to Vegas with our 15 year son - this trip was about seeing the Grand canyon and the Hoover Dam and this hotel was ideal for us. Would definitely return!!	
+	May 29 2009 	Lived up to expectation	The Signature totally lived up to our expectations. Main good points about it are easy check in, peaceful compared to rest of strip, excellent room service and extremely comfortable rooms. I also enjoyed having a balcony as this seems to be rare in Vegas.Only bad points are the resort tax which is a bit steep and the distance needed to walk to get through the MGM Grand although this is avoidable since location of Tower 3 means you can easily walk out the back entrance and find yourself at Planet Hollywood.	
+	Jul 22 2006 	Awesome !!!	Our family had just arrived at a new subdivison (new house). We discovered that the A/C was not working and would take 2 days to fix. With the inside house temperature holding at 100 degrees we would have to find lodging. We chose the Silverton just because it was so close to our home and we were too tired to do an in-depth hotel search. We figured because it was off the Strip, that the hotel was a hole-in-the-wall. We were DEAD WRONG. We walked in and was IMMEDIATELY impressed! The salt water aquarium was amazing, the Pro Bass Store was very impressive. We were given a spacious suite that was clean. The Twin Creeks Steakhouse is touted as new best restaurant; and there are other dining options as well. There's live entertainment by well-know musicians. The fitness room has everything for those who want a serious work out. The service from EVERY employee we had contact with was simply outstanding!You can also tell this is a place where they take pride in their appearance; there are also 2 Orange County custom made choppers in the main lobby (and again the aquarium really adds to the decor)We checked in on a Thursday and the price was reasonable, but it did go up on Friday because it was the weekend. Still, this was WELL WORTH it when you considered the overall atmosphere this lodge/casino has to offer.We HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Silverton and will stay again if we have to.	
+	Oct 2 2005 	Wow!!! What an incredible value	Just checked in to the Silverton hotel &amp; casino and am very, very impressed. When I was searching for a &quot;value&quot; option for lodging for my wife and I for 2 nights near the strip, I decided to give the Silverton a try. When my wife learned that we had paid $78.42 total for 2 nights (including all taxes and fees), she was REALLY afraid I had booked us at a roach motel. This place couldn't be further from that. Clearly, the whole hotel was just updated and I while I don't usually go ultra-luxury in Vegas (stayed at the Luxor, Excalibur, Stratosphere, Bally's, Treasure Island, Ceasar's Palace, Las Vegas Hilton, MGM Grand), I can honestly say this room exceeds most and rivals any I've stayed in while in Vegas. They even have pillow-top mattresses. Unbeatable for the price!!!	
-	Nov 3 2009 	Second Visit	I visited this property last January and had an outstanding experience. I just spent 6 days at this Hotel and was surprised to see a difference in a short time. On first visit we did not notice a smoking problem in the casino. This time the smoke was so bad we did not go to the casino at all. The rooms both times were excellent and the service in the restuarants was good. If you don't mind an off strip Hotel it is OK. If you have issues with smoking, you might consider another location.	
+	Jul 3 2008 	Had a great time	I would recommend this hotel. I am pretty picky when it comes to hotels so it was nice to find that this hotel was not only affordable, but also very clean. The room was clean and had a nice scent. Nice huge TV. Room was made up daily which included bathroom toiletries from Bath and Body Works. I loved the huge shower. Also, the Silverado Steakhouse is pretty pricey and the food was good. I expected more for the money however the service was wonderful. Everyone needs to splurge once is a while : ) Don't forget to use the coupons in the Fun Book provided at check-in. It saves you money. Don't detach the coupons before use or they will be voided. The casino was a lot of fun. I won $175 which made it even more exciting. The staff was very friendly and responsive. I had a problem with the in room safe and an Engineer showed up within 5 minutes and took care of the problem. I am coming back to this hotel on my next visit.	
+	May 12 2008	*****Awesome hotel and ammenities!!!	Gorgeous rooms, all you need under one roof for entertainment, great buffet, convenient shuttle service to the strip. We had a great time here, highly recommended!!	
+	Apr 20 2009 	So happy we found this hotel	We had a two family, six person group attending a horse show at the Thomas and Mack Center. This is like a normal hotel anywhere else, no strip inconveniences like choosing between valet parking or a long walk, noisy common areas and smoke everywhere. This hotel was quiet, clean, completely non-smoking (indoors) with parking surrounding the hotel. The rooms are very spacious and nice and new looking. We had no problem keeping the pull-out sofa open the whole stay; we weren't needing the space. The only issues we had were: 1. Upon arrival, the morning staff had not assigned us rooms, so our request for adjoining rooms (or close by) was not possible. 2. The shower pressure was low in one room and the water could not get hot in the other (warm, but not as hot as some like). 3. As mentioned in another review, they ran out of food at free dinner at least an hour before it was to end. 4. I used my Amex to reserve the room, but they couldn't take it for payment! They said they were working on accepting Amex but couldn't at that time. All in all, very happy to pay a reasonable rate at get away from the noise and air pollution of the strip, yet be close enough still to feel like we are in Vegas.	
+	Nov 3 2009 	nice	It was good for the price that I paid. Clean and close to airport and shopping Malls.I would recomand it to friends.	
-	Apr 1 2009 	Must Read!!!!!!!!!! Important Info!	You get what you pay for! 100% True in this case. Stayed here for about a week during xmas/new years. Really cheap, paid on average like 20 bucks a night. Wouldn't come back here even if it was free! Location:Horrible. Far away from everything. Way too far of a walk. Very sketchy area (hookers.. drugs.. you get the point) End up paying for bus/taxi/your own gas to get anywhere. Service:Horrible times hundred. We stayed here for 4 nights and then went to the South Point (which I highly recommend - even though its off strip) for a couple nights and then came back here - BAD IDEA ! lol. When we were checking in for the 2nd time, I had to give the front desk clerk my credit card. After checking in I was back in my room and noticed I did not have my credit card with me. I realized that I never did get my card back from the front desk (this should not be my responsibility to remember to ask for my card! they should give it back to you without asking!) So I go straight up to the same lady who handled my check-in and she said she didn't have it and she gave it back to me. Thank GOD the lady next to her overheard our conversation and she turns around and grabs a card from the back desk and says is this it?? I said YES, grabbed my card and gave the other girl a dirty look. Wow that would not have been good losing my credit card in vegas! Rooms:Horrible. Our 2nd room had a leaking toilet with water all over, so we called to get it fixed. A plumber came in 2 hours later to fix it. He left and told us it was fixed. It did stop leaking so we were fine with the room (even though it stunk like smoke and sucked but we didn't care for the price we paid). So we get ready and go out for the night come back around 3am and go to bed. The next morning around 11am we get security breaking through our door yelling &quot;SECURITY!!&quot; .. I almost ** my pants! My bf yelled &quot;What the ** is going on?!?&quot; A maid was along with the security guard and she just said sorry and they left. My bf called down to the front desk to see why the hell security was coming into our room with no explanation. We were then informed that there was a message left on our answering machine from the night before and it was our fault that we didn't check it! They said when its blinking we need to check our messages! Honestly who checks messages on a hotel phone when your in vegas and come back to your room bombed at 3am? Not me! Apparently we were suppose to be out by morning because they needed to &quot;service&quot; the room because it sells for a lot more on new years eve and the toilet still needed to be fixed. We told them that the toilet was fixed? But they didn't listen and said we needed to be out. One of the ladies at the front desk told us we would be upgraded to a new room for no extra cost, and then we got a call back from the front desk 5 minutes after saying she was sorry there was no available room!!? Hahaha like how crazy is this! I could not even believe this was happening! So we had to pack all our stuff up and leave a day before we were suppose to check out! To make things even worse they weren't even going to give us a refund for the night that I paid ahead of time! After much debate, I had to find my receipts and prove I did indeed pay, and I got my refund - since we would not be staying there that night. WHAT a nightmare!! We ended up staying at treasure island for new years eve and it was also an awesome hotel! Worth the extra money!! Casino:Horrible. Stunk. Grubby. Don't understand how people would have wasted their time in this casino when your in vegas! Restaurants:Horrible. Over-priced. Room-service is also way over-priced. We wanted to order room service and we had to call like 5 times to finally have a menu brought to our room! Was like 40 bucks for eggs/bacon and chicken fingers! lol Was there anything good about this hotel?? Honestly I can't even think of anything I liked! The only thing I liked was that I was in vegas!	
+	Mar 22 2009 	Can't Beat the Value!	For anyone who is considering staying at the Stratosphere to save a few bucks, do NOT listen to the negative reviews. This hotel and casino is definitely worth staying at in order to save a few bucks on your trip. We stayed Sunday through Thursday and when asked if an upgrade from the base room was possible, we were given the option of staying at a deluxe mini suite for only ten dollars extra per night (regularly fifty dollars per night). Our check in took all of five minutes and we were ready to go. The room itself was clean and nice. We did run into a slow draining sink, but maintenance fixed it within five minutes of our call. Yes, the hotel is far from the true strip, and yes you will have to walk a while, but the bus stop is just outside the hotel and is available for only a two dollar fare. Finally, obviously the hotel is not going to be a five star hotel--rooms are going for as low as twenty-five dollars a night--it's not going to be the Belagio, people! BUT it is worth checking out if you are on a lower budget and it still puts you in Las Vegas.Thank you Stratosphere!	
+	Jan 10 2009 	Extremely Pleased with My Pick Terrible's in Las Vegas	The Consumer Electronic Show is this weekend in Las Vegas. The stuff that will be coming to our electronic shelves is great, but that is not what this review is for.When I've attended the convention before, I usually stay at Sam's Town Casino and Hotel, but have seen the Terrible's Hotel as I have headed to the strip.I wanted to be a little bit closer to the action, since my wife wanted to tour Vegas, while I attended the convention. After checking several websites, I found Terrible's at about the same price as Sam's Town.After checking tripadvisor.com, as usual, I decided to book with Terrible's with a total two night total cost of $125. Strip hotels were more than $200+ per night.Check-In: Was horrible because there was only one clerk at the desk helping customers, the other person kept pretending that we were not standing there and was busying herself with some task. Fortunately, another clerk came after 15 minutes and jumped right into the fray and processed everyone quickly. So the experience did improve.Getting to the room: Terrible's has a small casino in front of the check-in desk. Because of that the area around the check-in desk is extremely heavy with smoke. If you have allergies and can't handle smoke for a few minutes then this is not the place for you. I just breathed through my mouth until I headed to the room.Room: I was pleasantly surprised because the room was in the tower portion (newer I think), was very large, had a nice interior, large lcd tv' and was quite modern. The bed was huge! Most of all, my wife who arrived on a later flight, thought it was great for the price.Bathroom: Was simple, but very nice. The hot water comes out of the faucet within about 5 seconds. Towels and toiletries were more than sufficient.Location: It is located on the Corner of Paradise and Flamingo, coordinates are N36 06 49, W115 09 11 according to GoogleEarth. It is only 1 mile from the strip, so you can walk the distance if you would like to. However, there's a city bus that will carry you to the strip. It is about 1 mile from the convention center as well. This is a business area with other hotels nearby as well as some office businesses. It was totally comfortable in that area.Things nearby: There is a Bahama Breeze on the other side of the intersection. There is a PF Chang's right across the street. Cozymel Mexican restaurant is no more than a 1/4 block away.The name Terrible's had always put me off in the past from staying here. However, I will tell you that for the price, the place is very good, especially if you get a tower room. Check-out: Went much better than check-in. It was quick and smooth this morning. Because of the early time there was not much smoke. Vegas can get expensive on the weekends, but this place was very good for the money.Two photographs were taken of the room. Please see them attached.	
+	Jun 25 2008 	Very nice place for a budget!	This is a wonderful place!!!!!! The people are friendly, the room was great, the deals were big time deals!!!!! If i wanted to complain it would only b about the buffet, Now that was &quot;TERRIBLE&quot; !!!! Other than that, my husband &amp; I loved this small time casino. When you visit, ask about Ellis Island, the steaks there were the best! We went to Vegas for our 1st year anniversary and we loved it!! Please don't forget to try the cafe' upstairs, the food is great!! i was worried, but don't let these reviews worry you! Go &amp; enjoy! You really will have a wonderful time at TERRIBLE'S. The pool was fab-u-lous!!!!!!!!!!!	
+	Mar 29 2008	nice room	The room was nice, spacious, clean, inexpensive. 2 sources of noise, in the flightpath of the airport, and cars speeding through the parking lot. If we stayed again, I would request a room away from the perimeter of the building.	
+	Sep 11 2008 	Very satisfied	This hotel in our opinion was great. The rooms were nice, good sized, and bathrooms were large for hotel standards. Everyone from the dealers, to waiters, to desk clerks were very friendly. The only negative I could say is that the two restaurants we tried were not the best, but o.k. Loved the 99 cent margarita's at the mexican restaraunt. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting something off the strip but with easy transportation to and from.	
+	Jun 1 2008 	Shame about Etta	Had a great week at the hotel. Stayed on the 19th floor, not a great view but it was quiet.Found the shuttle service excellent and as my husband uses a wheelchair we were always called to the front of the queue to board the bus first. Drivers were all polite and helpful.Booked this hotel as we were seeing Etta James as my husband has been a big fan for 30 years and so decided as a treat to book the trip as a surpise for him. We live in the UK so it involved a long journey. Saw Etta on the Sunday however she was not well and only did 35 minutes of her show. Saw everyone complaining about it at the box office and joined the queue. They took our ticket stubs and said we would get a refund. Thought they were just saying that to get rid of everyone but when I got home I checked my credit card statement and sure enough I got a full refund.Have read the other reviews and stayed at the same time as other people and can't believe some of the things written. The sun does take its time to cover the pool completely and there were always plenty of sun beds. The pool area was kept clean. Our floor was non-smoking and didn't smell of smoke. The casinos were not as bad as others I have been in for cigarette smoke. Wish it could be banned everywhere but know it's not possible.Had the buffet breakfast each day which set us up til dinner. Ate in Don Miquels during Happy Hour and thoroughly enjoyed to Chinese/Japanese restaurant as well.Would definitely book this hotel again.	
	+	Great Stay	This is our second stay here and we would not stay anywhere else. The service and the rooms always excede our expectations. The rooms are huge and always clean. The service is great and are always happy to help you. Everyone who works there from the maids to the taxi line people are always saying good morning, afternoon, ect. I would recomend this hotel to anyone.	
+	Sep 4 2009 	Just Book It!	First time in Vegas and so glad we stayed in the Palazzo. Location is perfect, right opposite TI and in the middle of the strip. Having looked at all the other casinos this is my opinion one of the better ones. As for accomodation, the rooms are enormous, large comfy bed, split level sitting area, large marble bathroom and three flatscreen TVs. Couldn't fault it. A couple of tips, when checking in try the $20 dollar trick (it does work!). and keep tipping the waitresses and they will keep on bringing the drinks. Also try the Grand Lux cafe, great food at resonable prices in a relaxed environments. Be warned though the portions are huge! If your like me and spend hours researching on TA don't bother and just booked this place.	
+	Jun 16 2009 	Incredible Amazing Beautiful	I was so surprised when I got there.The lobby and suites at marble all over the place.They had three TVs. One in the bathroom, one in the living room(which was separated by stairs), and the last one in the bedroom.The pool was fairly big and had a restaurant on the pool deck. The pool was on the 3rd floor.The hotel was connected to the shoppes at the Palazzo. And had a good location on the strip.I REALLY enjoyed my stay!	
+	May 26 2009 	Great stay at a luxury hotel.	We stayed at the Palazzo Hotel for 3 nights 5/22 to 5/25. I booked a Fortuna Suite as with the great rate I got thru Expedia, I figured we would treat ourselves to a nicer room. My wife and I were there celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary and had left the kids at home. We arrived at the Palazzo at 10:30pm Friday night and as soon as we walked thru the doors, we were greeted with a beautiful lobby filled with beautiful people (they were ling up to get into the Lava Lounge). We headed to the check in desk and waited maybe 5 minutes to check in. We were greeted in line and then escorted and introduced by name to an agent who checked us in. They were all very professional and always had a smile. We headed up to our room which was huge, 940 square feet. All the Fortuna Suites have a view and ours was on the 15th floor with a view of the pool and TI. It was fantastic. The walk in closet was very nice and the bathroom was wonderful. All the electronics worked and everything was clean. There was a door on the living room tv stand that didnt close all the way but other than that, the room was perfect. We spent Sat and Sunday mornings/early afternoon at the pool. The pool is huge and there are many different decks to lounge on. It was very crowded however and was a bit of a challenge finding chairs on Sunday. But with a bit of persistence, we found some and enjoyed our lounging time. Bar service at the pool was pretty good. We didnt actually order any drinks at the pool, but there was a server who came by regularly to see if we did want to order. The sun does come out a bit late at the Palazzo pool, probably around 1100am is when the whole deck gets that sun. However, if you go to the little pool all the way to the north end, away from the Venitian, you can get sun at 8:00am. Our room was cleaned everyday and never had any problems with late cleanings. We would leave the room in the AM and by mid afternoon the room was clean. We ate most of our meals outside of the Palzzo so didnt order room service. We did eat at Grand Lux Café for lunch and it was pretty good. We like the Cheesecake Factory so wasnt much of a stretch for us. Love the fact that there is a Walgreens at the Palazzo so we were able to get cheap water and snacks. So, basically loved this hotel and will now go there with every stay. Service was great, people watching there was fantastic and the room was top notch.	
+	May 9 2009 	Loved it!	Excellent hotel! Prefer this to the Venetian. Rooms are really nice, location on the strip is great. I left something behind at the hotel and called and emailed them, but they never returned my calls/emails. That was the only downside.	
+	Apr 27 2009 	Beautiful Hotel Casino 	Stayed at the Palazzo for 4 nights for convention. It is a beautiful hotel and the room was great. Seems well kept and clean. Had an issue with a broken exterior door handle and was greeted by a gentleman in maintenance within 5 minutes of notifying housekeeping!!! Great amenities, gorgeous pool &amp; truly high end shopping! Had lunch a couple times at the Lux Cafe (owned by Cheesecake Factory) &amp; the food was fantastic... you must try the Flautas! Spent most time on the penny slots... tables were too rich for my blood! If you're looking for $5 mins you pretty much need to go Downtown. As for luck, I've never had it good although... no one else I was with ran with a winning streak either. I would recommend the Palazzo for anyone staying in Vegas!	
+	Apr 12 2009 	A Sweet Suite Experience  The Palazzo Las Vegas	My wife and I had the opportunity to spend two nights at the Palazzo in Las Vegas April 4th and 5th 2009. We loved every aspect of our stay.We drove to town and deposited our car with the valet and luggage with a bellman. We had reserved a Concierge level room (suite) based on many comments on Trip Advisor. A couple of days before arrival I received an email describing the check-in process. We drove to the Palazzo, left our car with the valet and our luggage with a bellman and proceeded to the 23rd floor Concierge lounge.We were greeted immediately and check-in took only a few minutes. We received the requested king bed suite on the 25th floor, which is non-smoking. We used the private elevator that runs between 23rd and 28th floors which we thought was kind of cool. Two elevators service the six concierge floors so one comes almost immediately and gives a feeling of exclusivity.Our suite, #25833 was wonderful! It smelled fresh and was spotlessly clean. It had every amenity we could want including being absolutely quite. We never heard any noise whatsoever when we were in our room which I appreciated. Our only frustration was that it took over an hour to get our luggage once the concierge called for it. I called guest services a couple of times and it finally arrived.The king bed was very comfortable and the pillows and bed linens seemed to be very high quality. Night stands and lamps were on both sides of the bed. There was a CD player with clock radio on one side and phone on the opposite night stand. On the wall across from the bed was a 42 High Def flat-screen TV. Under that was a dresser with a lighted top. Next to the bed was a double-door lighted closet.On the wall between the sleeping area and sitting area were the thermostat and the remote for the blinds and black-out curtains. Our suite had a view of basicallynothing of interest. Our suite faced East and the bellman suggested we close the black-out curtains if we wanted to sleep later in the morning.The sitting area had a large sectional sofa and a large coffee table. The couch was very comfortable. There was a small desk next to the couch with both wired and wireless internet connection. Because the charge was $9.95 per day I used my Verizon wireless connection instead. Next to the desk were a Brother multi-function (AIO) printer, fax, copier, and scanner. The work area seemed cramped, but we were not in Las Vegas to work.Across from the sofa were a 32 flat-screen High Def TV and a standard DVD player. Some of the channels on this TV did not work, but again we were not in Vegas to watch TV so it did not matter to us. We did not report the problem. Under the TV was a mini bar, which we did not use, and an electronic safe, which we did use. Also across from the sofa was a round table and chairs with seating for three.The bathroom was very luxurious with both a deep bathtub and a glass-enclosed shower. The vanity area had dual sinks and an assortment of high quality bath amenities. Towels for three were provided and my wife commented that she liked them better than ours at home. Two resort robes were also hanging in the bathroom and a 19 high-definition TV was mounted so above the vanity area. The water closet had a dual line phoneWe went to the Concierge lounge at about 5:30 to see what appetizers were being offered. We had not intended to make it our dinner, but the food was so good it and we ate so much of it that it was our dinner. That night food was from the Mario Batali restaurant B&amp;B Ristorante at the Venetian next door. Service in the Concierge Lounge was very good. It was crowded, but the food was continually replenished. Mixed drinks were only served at the bar, but one of the attendants offered non-mixed drinks including wine and champagne continually.For me, the biggest benefit of paying to upgrade to the Concierge Level was coffee in the morning. Coffee and a continental breakfast were available from 6:00 AM. The continental breakfast was nicely presented and included fruit, baked goods, cold cereals, juice and croissant breakfast sandwiches. I enjoyed starting my days sitting and reading by one of the windows that overlook The Strip and enjoying three or four cups of the excellent coffee.Both my wife and I liked the Palazzos casino. It was less smoky than others and easy to navigate with wide aisles running from side to side and end to end. You did not have to weave your way through the casino to get to the guest room elevators as in some other casinos. At the entry to the guest elevators security seemed to do a good job checking room keys helping ensure non-guests were not wandering around.My wife and I both enjoy breakfast so we ate at Grand Luxe Café both mornings. For the first time ever in Las Vegas, I had a tip refused. The restaurant was full so I offered the hostess a tip for a booth. I was very surprised when we were politely told we would have a booth and a tip was unnecessary. Wow. My wife ordered a Garden Omelet both days and said it was the best omelet she ever had. I did the buffet and thought the food was excellent.Our only other dining experience was at Morels. We had a late lunch Monday and look forward to returning for dinner the next time we visit The Palazzo. The service and food at lunch were excellent, including a wonderful Vanilla Pavlova we split for desert. Morels offers a selection of specialty coffees and I really enjoyed the excellent Kenyan coffee.We used express check-out which involved filling out a card and leaving it at the Concierge desk. We had a bellman pick up our luggage when we checked out. When we left late in the afternoon we turned in the claim checks for both our car and luggage. Both arrived in about five minutes.We enjoyed our stay at The Palazzo very much. It is a beautiful hotel and the service was excellent. It may sound odd, but The Palazzo just felt very comfortable to my wife and I!	
-	Nov 10 2009 	Just OK. Off strip. Trendy clubs.	The reason to stay at the Palms is because it has trendy clubs and a pool that when hopping is likely to be full of attractive people that are good to watch. The pool is pretty small. That said, the rooms are small to average and elements of the rooms are poorly designed. The hotel is off the strip, which is a major consideration. I see little reason to stay here unless you plan to spend your time clubbing at the Palms' clubs. If you want to see Vegas stick with one of the places on the center strip. MGM, Bellagio, PH, Wynn, Venetian, Encore, Paris, Palazzo, Caesars, Mirage, TI are all better calls. If you want a great pool, go for Hard Rock, Mandalay, or MGM.I must say, the $69 rate that we got for one of the nights was pretty damn good. One other complaint is that even with the privacy light on, housekeeping came into our room twice. Now, I was there with a friend and we were resting in our own beds. There was certainly nothing happening that couldn't be seen by anyone, but in another situation with another person, this might have been somewhat upsetting. They could do better. The parking is good.	
+	Aug 5 2009 	1st time in Vages	amazing hotel! hot girls! clubs amazing! rooms amazing apart from finding a comdom beind the wardorbe next to teh bin. i huess the throw didn't make the bin! but non the less amazing place to stay. its linda off the strip where everything happends so you need to take a taxi everytime you leave the hotel. thats about $8.00+ a ride depending on traffic. i would say try get a place on the strip like MGM or wynn as you walk out into everything but the price would be much more. to get to the greyhoud from teh plams is about $20.00 but becarefull as they are money suckers and once they hear your acsent they take you for a ride as they think you have won stacks in you luggage.!i paid $99 a night for 2 doulbe beds which was a bargin so i cant complain what soever. just the location was a bit out of teh central strip. (strip i mean where everything happends!!)	
+	Sep 14 2008 	Comfy and Small..for Vegas	I stayed at the Palms for one night as friends were playing a show at the Pearl Theatre on the premises.I arrived at 11.30am and was delighted to find that the reception desk was just to the left of the entrance doors rather than, as is usually the case in Vegas hotels, miles away through a sea of slot machines.Despite usual check in tiem being 3pm the friendly desk staff were able to find me a free room witin 20 minutes. During the wait I checked out the shop, which has useful stuff like toothpaste and Tylenol as well as vintage Kiss t-shirts, and the tattoo parlour. The food court is a bit downmarket with a McDonalds of all the godawful things to have in a hotel but that's probably aiming at a young crowd. The cinema with Imax looked liek it had a good selection of movies.The room was great, I got a great rate at about £40 for the night, and this was totally worth it. Huge bathroom with Aveda toiletries and a decent size bedroom with a very comfortable king size bed. Was surprised to find the TV was a rather old tube TV with not that great reception, but then I guess you don't come to Vegas to sit in and watch TV. There were robes and an ironing board and iron in the wardrobe which is handy.The coffee maker was grim...clearly had not been cleaned in an eternity and just produced a foul smelling cup with bits of who knows what floating on it, but room service wasn't a bad price and efficient and friendly so if you are despearate for decent coffee just order it.My friends were staying in suites in the Playboy Tower so I got a look at these - huge rooms with lounges, fireplaces, wet bar, numerous bathrooms (one with disco lighting!) and aside from the questionable taste of a red leather sofa with leopard print cushions, if you can afford a suite here it looks like a great place to be!The Palms is a nice place to stay compared to some of the other Vegas hotels as it is relatively small, quite cool and young (rock music playing through the casino) and the rooms can be great value. However in the desert heat you simply can't walk to the Strip and you feel rather distanced from the lively atmosphere of Vegas.The Pearl Theatre is a nice venue, well laid out so that wherever you are you'll get a good view of the act and never be too far from the stage. If you are performing, the backstage area is very straightforward - essentially one long corridor of dressing rooms and production offices which lead straight to stage access.Overall, the Palms is a nice, comfortable hotel good for a young crowd who don't want to be constantly on the Strip.	
-	Jun 30 2006	Ripoff!	My son was assigned a locker in the Spa to place his belongings. Guess what! Somebody broke in and stole his money. The same thing happened to another guest. Upon inspection, other lockers had previously been broken into and repaired and reinforced with metal. Interesting that he was give an old locker. He received no satisfaction from the management (after 3 days of speaking to all the managers, etc.) and wished he had called the police. Was it an inside job? STAY AWAY!	
-	Sep 11 2005	It was terrible	The palms is very overrated. The staff is rude and non helpful. The bathrooms in the casnio areas were gross. Club Rain is advertised as the #1 club in vegas. It was the worst club I have been to in the 5 years I have been coming to vegas. The club is beautiful on the inside but they allow to many people in at one time. You can forget making it to the dance floor or the bar for that matter. The line for the bathroom is at least an hour wait. The security staff were pocketing money and allowing people to enter no matter how full the club was. I also saw several people being pushed and almost falling down because of the heavy crowd. I stayed in the club one hour, was unable to make it to the bar or dance floor. I left and went to Studio 54 and had a great time.	
-	Dec 22 2003	So who needs a working toilet	It sounded so great. A stay in a fully furnished apartment just a stones throw away from the Strip. What I actually got was a door that was a front door so loose that I had to pile up the furniture against it to stop anyone from coming into the unit when I was asleep, a sofa that was supposed to be blue but was brown from the stains, grey carpet with some great mystery orange stains, and a non working toilet for four days. When I had had enough I asked for a refund but was refused by the friendly staff as it was 'Against policy to give refunds'. Don't stay here unless you want to wast your hard earned money.	
-	Sep 14 2009 	Stay away from this one - warning not even 3 star	Don't be fooled by the &quot;priceline deal&quot;. This is no deal.Rooms are outdated, resemble the 70's.Carpet is old and warnservice at check in was terrible - with line.Westin should be embarrassed, and you will be too if you stay here.Spend 15 more a night and experience world class hotels - on the strip.Big mistake staying here - beware.	
+	Apr 30 2008 	WE Love The Westin Las Vegas	We have been staying at the Westin Las Vegas for about 3 years now pretty regularly. If you are going to Vegas to see white tigers and pretty fountains in your lobby, this is not the hotel for that. But if you want an amazingly relaxing stay, clean and comfortable rooms, and great customer service this is the place for it.Everytime we stay there, we say its like coming home. From my previous trips to any other hotel in vegas, you would never see the same person twice at any other hotel. At the Westin, its the same faces in the casino, the front desk, and the restaurant. You not only see the same people during your stay, but every trip. Its a nice welcoming feeling. And they remember you.Some of our favorite things about the hotel is the nice little Casino. It has every game you could want. It is practically smoke free. My partner and I like to gamble separately, so we can play and then easily find each other. If you order a cocktail from the waitresses it come rather quickly and if you move to a different table or slot machine, they will FIND YOU! (Try getting that kind of service from Ceasars!) Also, speaking of the big dog casinos, how do you think they pay for all that marble/fountains/pirate ships/volcanos/etc?? The Westin is nice, but not elaborate. Most trips there my partner and I come back with some money, get great comps and paybacks, and we attribute it to a better return rate in the casino vs. what you get at some other casino. (they have to pay for thier white tigers somehow)I have read several of the reviews on here, and yeah, its not a perfect hotel, but what they lack in some of their amenities they definetly make up in freindly, genuine, customer service.I cant wait for our next stay (this weekend)!	
-	Mar 21 2008 	Not a real Westin	First off, we booked our Saturday night stay on priceline for $85. We weren't sure what to expect after reading the TA reviews. It was billed as a Westin, so we thought it should be fairly nice/clean etc.. We heard a rumor that the Tropicana company owns and operates the hotel under the Westin logo. [and the Tropicana isn't known for it's luxury and fine dining]. Upon checkin (after 4pm) we were told that the only room available for US (i think she meant (but didn't say) priceline bookers) was the 4th floor; aka the doggy floor. We don't have any pets and we don't really like sleeping on old funky pet hair...so we asked for another alternative. The checkin gal essentially told us to take it or leave it. If we wanted another room it wouldn't be available until a &quot;much later time.&quot; So we took the room and it ended up being ok except for a few mystery stains and highly worn furniture, which is uncharateristic of the Westin brand. My wife used the gym and was satisfied...which was covered in the $10 resort fee. Also covered in the fee was in-room coffee and 2 water bottles.Overall, for a Saturday night stay we got our monies worth. I wouldn't pay any more for this hotel. We didn't gamble or eat there...We enjoyed gambling and eating at the Tuscany down the street.	
+	Jul 14 2009 	An easy escape...Vegetarians take note	I tend to like detail, so that's what you'll get with this review.However, if you don't feel like reading the whole thing, scroll to the bottom for a summary.*****************************************************************************************First let me state that the purpose of my stay was to catch UFC 100 and the coinciding UFC Fan Expo which were both based at Mandalay Bay. Being cl;ose to these events was my priority and it paid off--I met a ton of fighters and so much time was saved getting back and forth from the events.I have stayed in a few different properties in Las Vegas: NYNY, MGM, Hard Rock.I was scheduled to stay at Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino but when I arrived I was informed I was booked at The Hotel instead. I was a bit disappointed because, though it's rated 4 stars, the reviews on here were mixed.THE ARRIVALI moved to the lobby of The Hotel and my first impression was positive: You transfer from the hustle and blare of the casino into a cool, marble lined hallway that gets progressively dimmer until you reach the black and cream colored elevator banks that take you to the room-towers. It is very quiet here and you definitely get the feeling of moving into an exclusive, &quot;members only&quot; type area. The elevator arrived quickly (as it did every time I used on the whole 5 days I was there--never waiting more than a minute).THE ROOMThe room was a suite: A really nice sitting area w/ couch and chair set, a 42 inch flatscreen TV, a desk for work that had an available internet connection ($14.99 per 24 hour period--YIKES!) and your mini-bar that I barely looked at for fear of being charged for its contents! This area also had a separate powder room for guests you might invite in, I suppose. A nice touch.Through a heavy door (all the doors were super heavy for good sound insulation) you reached the bedroom. A large bureau with 2 closets and 2 drawer units for clothes ran along one wall of the room with the beds dominating the other. I found the beds fine and comfortable with high quality linens.The main bathroom is adjacent to the bedroom and it contains a counter with 2 sinks, a HUGE tub for 2, a large, separate shower and a room for the toilet--again, closed off by a very heavy door. The design was sleek and modern but very cosy. My main problems at this point were that housekeeping had obviously been in the room but vacuuming had been missed. There were peanut crumbs all over the bedroom.Also I found that when the room next to mine used their shower, a high pitched squeal ran as long as the water was on. Super annoying. To conclude: The room was lovely and it did feel like a home away from home that I looked forward to returning to every time I hit the quiet, enveloping lobby... THE CASINOThe hotel shares the same casino as Mandalay Bay proper. It is the best laid out, easiest to navigate casino I've encountered in all of Las Vegas. Getting to the room was a breeze with limited &quot;funneling&quot; you past slots, tables etc. in hopes of eaking out a $ as you crawl to bed.5 stars from me.DININGHere's where things get tricky for me. I am a vegetarian so Las Vegas is about the worst place on earth for me, food-wise.I tried several different restaurants and was mildly pleased (&quot;The Cafe&quot; right outside The Hotel's lobby--roasted eggplant and goat cheese sandwich) to downright disappointed (The Gourmet Burger Bar--horrid, pasty veggie burger)There is a coffee bar RIGHT OUTSIDE the elevators--The location was phenomenal. The coffee itself was just ok, but the convenience was so good...Plus it wasn't Starbucks, which makes me happy.For a quick bite I would use Canter's Deli--which was right next to the exit of The Hotel's lobby, in the sports book. The fries were great. (A drink and fries = $6.50)The best (hands down) meal I had was at &quot;The Border Grill&quot;. This is a Mexican restaurant right by the beach pool. The prices were reasonable, and the food was amazing. Very complex flavours and a fair number of vegetarian options. The best Mexican food on the strip, I guarantee. I can't recommend this place enough, great staff too.THE POOLThe pool was great. As good as the MGM, which I love.I was worried about the &quot;kid factor&quot;--(not a kid person)--but it wasn't an issue. I spent most of my time at the wave pool. It was fine. I found a chair every time I went out there even on Saturday (fight day) within moments of arriving. I went down first thing in the morning as well as later in the afternoon to right before lunch--always found a place to sit.If you were trying for 4 together or something it might be a problem but for 2 people, it was easy. THE STAFFConcierge/front desk staff were always very helpful and polite. Most game tables too.Security guard was rude to me when he had to come up and let me into my room due to a key malfunction.Housekeeping were polite but I distinctly told the head of housekeeping that I would like the entire suite to be vacuumed on day 3 and when I returned many of the peanut crumbs were still there. Disappointing. THE LOCATIONNot so great if you want to be in the center of the action, which I thought would be a problem but the property has so many amenities I found I didn't want to or need to leave.Also note there is a shop for &quot;everything&quot; (Magazines, toiletries, candy, water etc) right by the elevators of The Hotel as well. Very convenient, if a tad pricey.********************************************************************************************To sum up:Mandalay Bay is a great casino/resort with a lot of choice under one roof. It is a well-maintained property with helpful staff, and one of the most conveniently laid-out casino floors I've come across.The Hotel at Mandalay Bay is a self-proclaimed 4-star, exclusive minded hotel that lives up to its ambitions.You truly feel like you are getting away from the noise and hustle of the casino when you enter the premises yet they are located so close to the casino that going back and fort to your room is not daunting at all.The rooms are sumptuously appointed with great fixtures and again, a highly relaxing, quiet vibe.My Cons:$$$Expensive$$$This is one of the pricier hotels I've stayed at on the strip. $15 for a day of internet use is ridiculous. Seriously. In this day and age, where it's comped at even a Motel 6, paying that kind of money for a (near) necessity is truly disappointing.My wife had a shot of Grey Goose Vodka at 2 different bars and one was $12 the other was $13, so that's the kind of booze money you can expect. Sunscreen in the shop in The Hotel was $15 for 350 ml.I sort of felt, at times like they were trying to get every dime they could out of me, you know?Bottom line is, I didn't want to stay here, but the quality, comfort, convenience of this property made me a convert and I would stay here again. Even without a special event to attend.	
+	Nov 5 2008 	Always Perfect for us!	This is our third time staying in TheHotel. We have come to Las Vegas every year for my husbands birthday in June for the past 7 years. We have actually visited Las Vegas 13 total times. We have stayed in almost every hotel on the strip. WE LOVE THEHOTEL! The rooms are beautiful (especially for the price) and the staff is always very friendly and helpful. The always make dinner reservations for us anywhere we wanna go, even if its with another hotel. The restaurants are great and we love the Mix. (The view of the strip is amazing) We will be back again in January for New Years Eve!!	
-	Sep 10 2008 	TheHotel has TheWorst service in Vegas	Looked forward to TheHotel's stylish contemporary vibe, and x-large &quot;V-Suites.&quot; Decor &amp; size of room did not disappoint, but service was sub-par for expensive ($300-400/nite) room. Robes &amp; slippers appeared only after calling housekeeping, toiletries were never replenished during our 4 day stay (until we ran out and again called housekeeping), TV remote was missing from room, and this very large suite had a single small wardrobe which was inadequate for 2 adults on a 4 day visit (and we don't bring a lot of &quot;outfits&quot;). Biggest problem was the pool. Lovely pool complex, but a long walk thru the parking garage, or even longer walk thru casino to reach pool. And, inexcusably rude treatment from a pool attendant on a quiet weekday afternoon. Towels were too small to fully cover the beach chairs, and we requested a 2nd towel. Attendant refused to provide a 2nd towel to each of us (3 guests), which prompted a 45 minute call first to the concierge, then a front desk staffer, and finally front desk manager @ TheHotel. Their &quot;rules&quot; don't permit more than 1 towel/guest, but they &quot;would make an exception&quot; for me. When I returned to the pool after the calls, the attendant gave me 1 towel, &amp; when I said &quot;but we are 3 people&quot; I got some kind of answer along the lines of &quot;so what, 3? It's just another number. 3 + 1 make 4, 3 + 3 make 6,&quot; and so on, and he still refused to provide me with the 3 towels requested He did everything but give me the finger! We brought friends along for their 1st visit to Las Vegas, and as their host, I was terribly embarrassed by the treatment we received. I have never had an issue like this (having to beg for a 2nd towel), nor have I ever encountered rudeness from any hotel staff member, ever. I rarely ask for anything, and almost never have complaints. TheHotel's &quot;pool policy&quot; (allowing for only a single towel) &amp; staff problem would have been disappointing at a low-end motel, but was really outrageous at a hotel which promotes itself as a luxury property. Hotels are in the service business, and no matter how stylish the decor, mediocre housekeeping and rude service by staff are inexcusable. We paid 4 star prices, avoided low-cost deals, and received 1 star service.	
+	Nov 7 2009 	At walking distance from The Strip	Okay; a hotelroom in Las Vegas does'nt cost much.My car broke down just in front of the hotel.And that is how i found the meaning of the word &quot;service&quot; About the hotel; pool is small but ultra clean and fresh.Rooms are ok ,clean and cheap.At 5 minutes walking from MGM	
+	Nov 3 2009 	Brill hotel	Great value breakfast buffets with loads of choice. The rooms and bathrooms are lovely and clean - and the beds are the most comfortable I've ever slept in! Nice pool area though not huge. Overall a great place to stay	
-	Sep 23 2009 	Just OK	At check-in we were informed the hotel was at full capacity and we were given a smoking room even though we requested a non smoking room. The clerk told us it's never guaranteed. He told us we could switch rooms the next night and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne. That was good enough for us. The view from the room was TERRIBLE! Thank God it only had a faint cigarette smell. Of course, we probably wouldn't have noticed it after gambling all night. :) The next night in our new room was a totally different story! What a view!!!! Right down the strip on the 33rd floor. It was excellent. Nice room except there was what looked like a bloody mary spill on the bathroom floor. I sure HOPE that's what it was! GROSS! Also, our toilet was coming out of the floor. It slid around when you sat on it. Other than that, the room was nice. Casino wasn't so great. Food options not so good either. I wouldn't stay there again. There's too many better hotels there!	
+	Jun 26 2009 	Wonderful location room and service!	I have been a member of Trip Advisor for a couple of years, and have only ever felt compelled to leave one other review despite staying in hotels every month or two. Once again, I flet it was necessary to comment on the property after reading other reviews.First off, my wife and I fought over where we were going to stay on this trip to Vegas. I wanted to try Trump, or Palazzo (both new to us), or return to Wynn or Bellagio. She had a girlfriend who raved about TI and it's proximity to the Fashion Show Mall(has a walkway directly to it). I could care less about the mall, but knew that if she was happy, I'd be happy.Check in was efficient and friendly and clerk upgraded our suite to the 36th floor with the best view of the strip we have ever had. Room was a bit smaller than expected but suited our needs. Room itself was very clean and tastefully done. Only downside was a long walk from the elevator and occassionally would see room service dishes in the hallway for 6-8 hours.Didn't bother using the pool, looked crowded with 20 somethings, and left very little in their casino. Went to Mystere at TI, always a pleasure to see Cirque. Ate at Canter's twice, nice deli eats. Steakhouse was pleasant.Overall, we would recommend this property for couples or groups that want an excellent location and excellent value. Once this location disassociates itself from the MGM, it will be interesting to see how it is maintained.	
-	Sep 4 2008 	bombarded	My wife and I just returned from a 3 day 2 night stay at the Tropicana in Las Vegas. Overall we had a great time and really enjoyed Dirk Arthur and the Follies Bergere. The one major complaint we both have, is that you can't walk through the casino or main hall of the Tropicana without being bombarded with pushy sales reps. We found ourselves trying to find alternative routes to our room every day. We did alot of walking and visiting at other hotels on the strip, and this only seemed to be happening at the Trop. If we had to do this trip again, we would chose another hotel and pay more per night if necessary.	
+	Jun 7 2008 	Faded but fine	It's faded, but it's fine, especially at $49 a night -- the current base rate, if you don't count the phony $7.95 a night &quot;resort fee.&quot; We stayed three nights on a package deal, were booked for a garden room, but upgraded to Island Tower without asking and/or charge. The room was large, clean and comfortable. Who could ask for more? Nothing broken, moldy, etc., as some reviews have mentioned. Sure, the hall carpet has wrinkles, and the decor is hopelessly out of date, but who cares? Even the ceiling/walls mirrors are a kick. Only complaint was dirty windows -- haven't been washed in a while. Room was cleaned and made up promptly every day. All the staff we encountered were friendly -- well, a couple dealers were unfriendly, but that's a Strip tendency. The swimming pool/garden area is beautiful -- a throwback to the Trop's glory days, and well maintained. We only ate at the breakfast buffet and in the deli, and both were good.The Strip location is great, and it's nice to find $5 blackjack and craps tables at a Strip resort. If you're on a budget and want to stay on the Strip, this is the place. But for a really great inexpensive experience, try the Main Street Station downtown.	
-	Apr 16 2009 	Would pay more for a bit of service	We just got home from a trip to Las Vegas with our kids. My dad lives there so we visit fairly often. The Trump Hotel rooms really are lovely. We had a one bedroom suite that had all we needed for a family of four. That's really all they have to offer, though. The service was not great. Housekeeping failed to come to our room the first full day there. They stopped by the next morning to ask us when we'd like the room cleaned. We gave them a time and returned to our room in the late afternoon to find they had not come.Since there is no casino, not much choice for restaurants (and when I wanted to eat something at 11 AM, neither was open) and the spa is insanely overpriced, we had to leave the hotel to do anything except go swimming. The pool is nice (but no frills).I left wishing we had stayed at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay which also offers one bedroom suites. It would have cost us a bit more but I would have left much more satisfied. Better pool, better location, better customer service, more choices for eating, close proximity to a casino with the quiet lobby that's better for kids.	
+	Mar 28 2009 	Luxury Lovers Indulged -- Pedestrians Beware	My husband and I booked a 2 night stay at the Trump on March 21 &amp; 22. We got a great deal off of Orbitz, which included a free room upgrade to a view of the strip, and a $50 hotel credit which you can use at the restaurants, spa, or shops. We used our hotel credit for the fabulous breakfast buffet, which we loved, but it used up all of the credit easily! The Trump is not much from the outside, and the lobby is lovely and glitzy, but nothing special. However, the service was great... free valet parking, fast check in, and friendly concierge and bell staff. Our room was the real standout!! We had a great view of the strip, the most comfortable beds you can imagine, a giant tub, a kitchenette, a TV in the bathroom mirror... I could go on and on!!! This room was one of the best I have ever stayed in -- including much more expensive hotels! We were totally spoiled! The only bad thing about the Trump is the location. My husband and I like to walk the strip in Vegas, but the the Trump is about 2 blocks off the strip and there are no sidewalks on those roads. Plus, at night, there is no lighting whatsoever. Very spooky. As other reviewers have pointed out, you can walk through the mall to get to the strip. This is not any closer, just safer walking. When the mall is not open, you just have to walk on the unsafe, scary streets. We ended up taking cabs at night, which actually worked out well because it was really windy that weekend and I didn't want to get the windblown look! Our taxis ranged from 7 to 12 dollars. Overall, I would stay in the Trump again in a heartbeat! The room was amazing and I am still missing those comfy beds!	
+	Mar 21 2009 	Nice stay off the strip	Let me start off by saying that I'm NOT a gambler. My main purpose for going to Vegas was to have a fun and relaxing weekend away. I just wanted to lounge by the pool, go to a fun club/lounge, and maybe see a show. With that said, The Trump was perfect for me. I personally liked not having a casino at the bottom of the hotel. I liked having less foot traffic in the lobby, which for me, made it more relaxing coming back from the strip. But, if gambling is your thing, The Trump is only a short walk to casinos. So in short- The lobby and rooms are very nice and clean. The pool was simple but adequate. There are plush lounge chairs with pool side service. The gym and spa (although i didn't use either) seemed sufficient. The Trump is very close to the Wynn (Tryst) and I saw Jersey boys at the Palazzo which was a very close walk. The only con is that if you want to be in the &quot;center of all the action&quot; - Its not on the strip. But for me.... it was perfect for a weekend get-a-way.	
+	Aug 19 2008 	Peaceful Oasis!	My wife and I stayed at the Trump from Aug. 8-10 and found the hotel to be beyond our expectations. I had warned her that the hotel had no casino, no choice of restaurants, and was a 5-7 minute walk from the strip, but she still loved it. After spending the day trying to squeeze past crowds in the other hotels and inhaling pungent cigar smoke, it was nice to come back to a hotel that smelled like flowers and was always quiet. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They will go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable. Two things to note that we didn't like. First, the pool closes at 6pm which is absolutely ridiculous. It's 95-100 degrees in Vegas all summer. it would be nice to be able to take a swim in the evening to cool off and unwind. Second, it is very convenient to cut through the mall to get to the strip during the day, but at night, when the mall is closed, it can be a little dangerous trying to navigate your way back down the street with cars whizzing by and no consistent path for safety. I hope they address this and build a walkway to the strip for patrons. As for the room itself, it is heaven! The bed is the most comfortable you will find anywhere and the bathroom is a woman's dream! Double marble sinks, a jacuzzi tub, a huge shower, and a separate area for the toilet. Don't forget about the built-in 17&quot; LCD TV in the mirror! The room also has double doors so that hallway noise does not pass into your room..great idea! I must admit that the train that most people complained about does wake you up around 8:30am but it wasn't a big deal for us since we wanted to get up early to take advantage of the day anyway. If you're concerned about it, ask for a room on the highest floor possible or get a strip view room on the other side.	
+	Oct 31 2009 	Great place - great price	This hotel was very reasonably priced. It has spacious clean rooms and very clean grounds/facilities/casino. My conference was held here and the room for the meeting was clean, food service was good, and was not too hot or too cold. The food at Marilynn's Cafe and the Cantina was excellent for the price, the Tuscany Garden's was a bit over rated. We were in walking distance of the strip and when we needed a cab, one was easily found.	
+	Oct 22 2007	Can do better in Vegas	Just got back from the Tuscany today, after staying there for 4 days/3 nights.Like my title says, you can do better in Vegas. The Tuscany is a so-so hotel off the strip. Fine if you have no expectations, but disappointing if you are hoping for a nice hotel.Pros: Each room is a suite, so you can sleep a family comfortably (there's also a couch). Rooms are very large; the bathroom has a separate tub and shower. There is also a kitchenette with empty fridge (no mini-bar so you can store your leftovers), microwave, and double burners. You can park close to your room as the hotel is made up of numerous small buildings, named alphabetically (A, B, C etc.), and parking is on the periphery. The hotel offers video checkout. I never felt unsafe on the property.Cons: Everything else. Hotel is off the strip (not far, but not walking distance). Hotel is loud. These rooms have the thinnest walls and floors. There are 3 floors in each building, so tell the front desk when you check in that you want a room on the third floor. Trust me, you can hear everything on the first floor, which was where we were first assigned.Let's see, what else... You get a kitchenette, but no pots, pan, plates, or silverware. Basically, you can't use it; it's just for show. Call down to the front desk and they won't provide you with anything. We asked for a fork to eat the leftovers we had brought home from their restaurant. The front desk transferred us to room service who told us they could not provide us with silverware unless we ordered room service. What's the point of providing a kitchenette if you won't let guests use it? Case in point: Our double burners were brand new.In-room coffee is terrible, it tastes like coffee-flavored water - no exaggeration! FYI: There is a Starbucks at Flamingo and Paradise. Housekeeping is also terrible. We returned the first day to find our paper cups with coffee still sitting out on the table, coffee maker unemptied, etc.Hotel restaurants: We tried to have lunch on a Friday at the hotel, and their Italian restaurant, Tuscany, is only open for dinner. The sports bar was not open either. We ended up going to Marilyn's Cafe for slow service and an incompetent waitress. Food was fine but skip it if you want decent service. We tried dropping by the coffee shop, Beachfront Coffee, to grab a quick sandwich but the meats in the sandwiches were indecipherable in the display case. Not a good sign!Our deadbolt popped out and we couldn't close the door to leave. Apparently, this happens a lot, in other guestrooms too. You have to twist the handles this way or that way - try twisting both the indoor and outdoor handles at the same time (that worked for us; other people had different techniques). Our door handles were about ready to fall off too.Wake up call line doesn't work. You're put on hold forever to get to the front desk. Our phone started acting funny and all the front desk people could say was, &quot;Your phone isn't working, I can't hear you. I can't hear you!&quot; No offer to send someone to fix our phone. Just &quot;I can't hear you.&quot;On a side note, take a look at the paintings in the room. Our room had 4 paintings, 2 of which were the exact same print. Who decorated these rooms??All in all, the hotel is adequate if you're on a budget and really don't care where you lay your head at night. We didn't see any insects and our toilet flushed fine and we had hot water, heating, and AC. But if you're looking for a comfortable place to stay, look elsewhere because the Tuscany is just &quot;so-so&quot;. Take a look at the reviews on Tripadvisor, most echo my opinion.	
-	Nov 10 2009 	Seen better days poor value	Not much positive to say, unfortunately. Poor value for money compared with the offers from Wynn/Encore, and the still beautiful Bellagio. The location suits me, close to Fashion Show Mall, Forum Shops, Via Bellagio Boutiques and the shops at Wynn. The Venetian was the hotel I stayed at during my very first visit to LV, so I re-visited out of nostalgia. I booked a King bed suite, and found myself talked into an upgrade to pool view when I checked in. Room on 25th floor, so I figured the view should be nice. Instead I found myself staring at two cranes working on an unfinished section of the Palazzo. Also realised pool view is no great shakes, unless you want to spend time in your room during the day, and look out of the window. Vegas is really about the fantastic Strip at night.The furnishings are dark, heavy and a bit oppressive, particularly combined with the poor lighting. Even with all the lights on (including the light in the cupboard) I still felt as though my eye sight was going. Little things really - separately no great problem, but in combination one kind of feels the enthusiasm is lacking. Cupboard door warped and jamming, silicone sealant in the bathroom curling away from the marble tiling, battery needed replacing in the tv remote, wobbly taps, switches etc. The toweling robe was not exactly generously cut (I'm not fat), moving walkways not working - my general impression was that money was being saved by cutting back on maintenance and luxury touches. Bit depressing, really. Slots tighter than a gnat's backside, piped music in public areas way too intrusive, and the offensive synthetic aroma everywhere is just vile. By day three I couldn't stop sneezing, and my nose started to bleed. At the Grand Canal shops and restaurants, a live string trio serenaded diners, but the poor musicians had to compete with loud piped music. The breakfast buffet in the Grand Luxe Cafe is boring, except for the fresh fruit selection. The daily resort fee (what is that - punishment for staying there??) supposedly includes a newspaper, to be collected at a desk near the ground floor escalator, but it was never open at the time I left the hotel for the day. I had a really super Halloween weekend, but will stay elsewhere next time.	
-	Oct 8 2009 	Don't bother - they could care less	Yes the Venetian Hotel is Big and Beautiful but that is all. How can a hotel this large provide any level of personal service? - The answer is they can't. When we arrived in late afternoon, we were told our room was not ready. We asked the desk clerk to call us on our cell phone to tell us when it was ready, and they declined. They told us to &quot;keep checking&quot; back in to see if it was ready. We were then let loose in the casino which is to their advantage of course. After several hours of &quot;checking back&quot; we finally received our room keys. We were not given an orientation of the hotel or the services it offered. We were not told where anything was, not the hotel dining rooms, not the pool, not nothin. We asked the concierge for recommendations and honestly it was as if we were bothering her (yes we tipped) - The whole experience at the Venetian was like that - like they could care less if we were there or not. Because the Venetian is built on such a grand scale, there is a constant stream of tourist filing through looking at the surroundings. I felt like I was staying in a fish bowl, with people constantly standing and staring. We were just one of many guests who will pass through there. The funny thing is, since we have returned home we have received almost weekly mailings inviting us back to events at the Venetian.We visit Vegas often and I will never stay at the Venetian again. I will select a smaller more personal hotel with more personable staff. I prefer Bellagio.	
+	Sep 2 2009 	Best room ever eventually	We were able to check in within 10 minutes of arrival. When we got to our room, we found that only one light in the entire suite was working. So, we called the front desk, which took 7-8 minutes until we could talk to a human after going through the prompts, and were told that either they would send up an electrician or we could change rooms, and they would send up security to let us in and also someone with our new room keys. We decided to change to a room down the hall. We waited outside the room for 30 minutes and no one showed up. A maid went by and was kind enough to call for us. After another 10 minutes security finally showed up to let us in. Still no room keys. While we waited, we started to put things away and found that the safe was inaccessible. So, we called the desk again, waiting another 7-8 minutes to talk to a human, and explained the situation. We were told that someone would be sent up. After 10 minutes, someone did and fixed the safe in no time. Still no room keys. Again we called the desk, again waiting 7-8 minutes for a human, telling them we felt we were being held hostage in our room. We were told that they would send someone up (OH NO!) or we could pick them up downstairs. We decided on the latter. After all was said and done, we loved the room and the hotel. Largest and most comfortable room we ever stayed in - very clean, 3 nice tvs, remote controlled curtains. The smell in the lobby was quite pleasant. A pain that we couldn't use the fridge because of the sensors on their stuff, but we used one of the 2 sinks, filling it with ice to keep our beverages cold. The best perk we received was the $50 slot credit, and we came away with $55. We did the outdoor gondola ride and loved it. Madame Tussaud's was fun. We had dinner at the hotel and it was very good. The pools were great, and there were plenty of lounge chairs and towels.	
-	Jul 13 2009 	OK hotel not the best	We stayed at the Venetian from the 3rd to the 10th of July. This was for our honeymoon and we had come via San Fran. Initially we were looking for somewhere to chill out a bit and in hindsight Vegas may not have been the best choice. The Venetian was certainly not the best choice for a chillout. I was surprised by how many children were around the swimming pool. Vegas is meant to be for grown ups and there seemed to be a lot of kids who were not really being looked after, i had heard in the past that the Venetian was really not kid friendly - there are only so many times you can hear &quot;Marco&quot; &quot;Polo&quot; without going mad!!! Also getting space around the pool at the weekends was a nightmare. They have about 6 pools but the problem is that you get different music blaring from all different angles which means that it is just noise. We were there for July 4th so i suppose you have to expect the crowds. The rooms were OK, house keeping knocked at 8:30 am everyday which was annoying. The restaurants in the hotel are all good, you cannot argue with the quality of the food at either the Venetian or the Palazzo. All levels of restuarant from casual to fine dining were amazing. The casino floor lacks the atmosphere of other casino's in particular the Wynn/Bellagio and those up on Freemont and the waitresses are a little slow in getting around. Whilst there we went to see Phantom of the Opera - i think this was a subconcious decision as they played the music in the lifts all the time. I would recommend this show to anyone, best show we saw, the others were LOVE and Peepshow (Holly Madison playing bo peep - i think she should stick to her day job)The big thing i would say is that the Venetian is expensive, even for Vegas. This is in terms of food and drink but it did not help that the pound is weaker than when i last went to the states. We really wanted to go to TAO whilst there but was put off by the look of the crowd - imagine 1000 21 - 25 year olds on a mission to get wasted!!!! The clubs in the Wynn we a lot better, i especially liked the music in Blush and bumping into Dolly Parton was a bonus in Blush.I think if I go again i would stay at the Encore or the Wynn or maybe Planet Hollywood. The best thing about Vegas is that you can get round to see all the hotels/casinos so i suppose where you are staying is just a place to lay your head.	
-	Nov 3 2007 	You get what you pay for	Stayed for 3 nights as a cheap alternative to Las Vegas-$140 total.Good points-check in fine, room comfy with very big shower, monorail/bus to neighbouring properties across the freeway, Fashion Outlet Mall adjacent.Bad points-Coffee Shop staff disinterested/understanding of English quite poor, wash basin in room took 20 minutes to drain, poor TV reception, pool closed for season despite temperature in 80s, woken at 6am one morning by what sounded like a plane using reverse thrusters but was actually the strong wind outside coming through the (turned off) air con unit, hair in food from Buffet, winnings from neighbouring casinos (owned by same company) could not be cashed at home casino.All in all, in future I would pay the extra and stay in Las Vegas.	
+	Jul 27 2009 	Great Resort in a Great Location	We loved this resort. We stayed at another resort off the strip, but wished we would have stayed at this one the entire time. We had a wonderfully updated room. They had a great kids or activity center in the main building (ask to be put on that floor if you can). The activity center had video games systems of all types, a pool table, table top games, movies you could borrow for free. If you want your kid to play the video games they had to have their own room key to trade for games. The computer room was accross from the game room and had lots of computers there and free printer. Also, the family pool was nice and they had other adult only pools. They had tons of activities, tours and services available at the resort. We enjoyed a pool party and tons of other activities. This is definately a great place to stay. They also had room service and small restaurant onsite.We went for July 4th and it was the best fireworks show I've ever seen. Definately worth it. We also took in some of the free shows and activities on the strip. The pirate show, the erupting volcano, the fountain show, the mardi gras parade and many other little sights to see. We were disappointed in Circus Circus ... too crowded and the place was dirty and over priced. However our day trip to the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam and Lake Meade was awesome.	
+	Apr 20 2009	great stay book this place	great place, rooms &amp; resort amenities were great. a lot of stuff to do in hotel if you choose. only set back its off strip but they have shuttle, if need be you can walk or cab	
+	Feb 15 2005	Loved it!	I've stayed at the Fairfield twice already and each time, it was a pleasure. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. They have a very large pool and more than one jacuzzi. The weight room is small but does the job if you're more interested in doing cardio.The staff was very friendly and the hotel is close to the strip. They even offer shuttle rides down to the strip. I recommend the facility especially for families. I'm not sure if you need to be a timeshare/points customer or member but they have a great game room for the kids and special free classes like yoga and in-room facial and makeup tips.-Qui	
+	Jul 23 2009 	Wynn Parlor Suite - Top notch	We booked Resort room in Tower Suites at Wynn through Amex Plat FHR, this include an upgrate if available - we arrived to check in (must have waited all of 2 mins) staff apologised for the wait! and brough us iced water- Front desk staff said unfortunately all the Exec suites were booked (that would normally be the upgrade) BUT instead he would put us in the next category of room - parlor suite!!! (for price of Tower suite resort room)Assigned room 3606 - on entry to left was half bath, then wet bar with decent sized fridge, sink etc. living room was good size had desk, sofas &amp; chairs, Large flat screen TV &amp; DVD, floor to ceiling windows with golf course view. A very comfortable room. Bedroom had great views another flatscreen &amp; the usual great wynn linens.the bathroom - Oh my god!! - every girls dream come true - it was huge - separate sink areas &amp; a dressing table area - perfect for getting ready, Jacuzzi bath - full of goodies - bath salts, bach scrubber, bath pillow etc, steam shower, WC and a walk in closet!!OK I had already decided I could happily live here!Turndown was great and did not have to be requested (but you also get that on request on resort side of hotel)Newspaper was delivered in the AMIn AM (6am - 8am or similar) there was free coffee &amp; cake served in bar area near Tableau. It was very nice coffee.Tower suites Pool area was nice - the main pool gets so busy it was nice to have a quieter option. Drink service was prompt &amp; as soon as you arrive attendents set you up with towels, water &amp; find you a lounger to suit your requirements IMHO Tower suites are worth the extra due to the peaceful oasis they offer - as soon as you walk to the tower suites side you notice the difference, somehow its calmer &amp; the service is very prompt - both front desk &amp; concerge were first rate, pool staff were also very attentive. Also (Big bonus) you skip the queues are the regualr front desk which at times can be lengthy. - Go on treat yourself if you can - I plan to	
+	Jul 1 2009 	Amazing Hotel Do not stay any where else in Las Vegas!	We stayed here for 4 nights as part of our Honeymoon. The Hotel was by far the best i have ever stayed in. We were upgraded to a room on the corner of the hotel so we had floor to ceiling windows on 2 sides of the room looking out over the golf course. The rooms are huge! With the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The bathroom again is huge with a TV by the sink. An a shower that could fit a small family. We ate in the hotel every night and the standard of food was exceptional. Yes some things are pricy but you get what you pay for and we got fabulous service, beautiful surroundings, and first class food &amp; drink. The pool area is wonderful, with free water a lovely big uncrowded pool, and water mist jets spraying out all around the pool to cool the air down. You can even gamble by the pool! The Casino we found to be the most tasteful in Vegas, we visited most of the other hotels and found them to be quite dated and in need of a facelift. The nightclub Tryst was amazing with a huge waterfall in the outdoor area. Everything about this hotel is first class, I could not pick a single fault with it.	
-	May 7 2009 	Great property Poor Staffing	This is a very nice property with unmatching service quality. Especially the tower suites concierge fails miserably; We were sent to worst shows and dinners. They even booked us a dinner at a closed restaurant ! They are clueless and do a great job acting as comeptent conceirge.	
+	Aug 24 2008 	Small friendly hotel	Small, resembling a pansion, hotel next to the Natural History Museum.The small deluxe double room had a terrace, which is fantastic when you are a smoker but, looks at a dull white wall which could better exploited by the hotel, for instance some plants or whatever to reduce stimulation of claustrophoebic feelings.The bathroom was excellent.The third bed promised by the hotel was there but was meant to serve a kid and not a third adult as it was explicitly and prior to the deal agreed- ...Breakfast must have been very dull, though included in the price we prefered going out and have some.( By the way I noticed that it was served on the buffet from 6 o' clock in the morning whereas the hotel was serving it after 08:00, meaning how these poor croissants could be fresh, hot and crispy if you decided to have them at, let's say 09:00?).Nothing to dine in the room, poor mini bar and as a conclusion, not a boutique hotel but a small, decent one with very polite people at the desk front and, sorry to tell this, lousy decoration especially in the lounge.	
+	Feb 6 2007	Good deal- but get an upstairs room	Good things: cheap for an en suite room, easy to book on-line at their website, fairly close to Victoria Station, friendly staffNot so good things: the ground floor rooms have terrible views- (so just request to be upstairs!).We stayed at the Alexander Hotel for 4 nights- in 2 different rooms in October. We opened the door to our first room (right next to the office) and we would have been a bit upset had it not been for our exhaustion/excitement for our first night in London after 24 hours of air and land travel. Our ground floor window looked out at a dirty alley and dumpsters with zero sunlight. The bathroom had a semi-non-flushing toilet and a shower that was about 4 feet tall. Oh well- we only paid 50 L/night, and we came to see the city- not the inside of our hotel room. We walked out the front door of this B&amp;B to see many other similar B&amp;B's (no shops or cafes)- about a 5 minute walk from the huge Victoria Station. We looked up to see a few rooms that had balconies- what do we have to do to get one of those? we thought as pictures of our dark alley view flashed through our minds. Guess what- our second two nights we were given one of the rooms with a balcony- lucky us. Same price- MUCH better room. We'll request a second floor room next time. Breakfast was very average- but it did the job. I believe that this is a low-cost B&amp;B- so the other occupants tended to be young travellers like us. The best thing about the small dining area was that you basically had to share space with the other travellers- which turned out to be a good thing- why travel if you don't intend on meeting people from other walks of life? I wouldn't recommend this B&amp;B for a couple that plans on spending lots of money on nearby fine dining and wants a fancy room with a great bathroom. The Victoria Station area isn't filled with trendy cafes and shops- but it is walking distance to lots of the churches and royal stuff. I would recommend this B&amp;B to someone who just wants to be in London- plans on Tubing and walking- doesn't plan on spending much time in the room.	
-	Aug 11 2009 	NOT a good hotel	I have stayed in the London Paddington area before, and there are nicer hotels than this one for similar prices. The staff was disinterested or absent. The rooms were small and the bathrooms smaller (even by London &quot;cheap hotel&quot; standards, this was small !) The free breakfast was not worth the price.The common areas (hallways, stairs, breakfast area) were in bad shape.I would not stay at this hotel again.	
+	May 18 2008 	Budget hotel thats quality	We've stayed in quite a few budget hotels in London and a lot of them are awful. Not the Alhambra though. The hotel is very clean and tidy, that was my first impression. Ok the rooms are not the biggest but there comfortable. One word of caution though. If you stay on the 1st floor the toilets and showers are situated on the 2nd floor but these again are clean and the shower had really nice hot water.One of the best bits about the Alhambra, apart from the £65 per night for a double, is their breakfast. It really is excellent. You can have a full english or continental. As its situated in Kings Cross its near to all the attractions to!	
+	Jul 6 2004	Did these people stay at the same place I did?!	Feel badly for the other critics here, but I thought the hotel was totally fine for the price! My room (a double) was clean, albeit very small. No curtains either to really block the light (just blinds), but certainly no insects to speak of. Safe didn't work in the room either and yes, the hotel room card took a few times to work. Thought the staff were pretty friendly too? Decent breakfast. I've travelled extensively too so I know what I'm talking about. It was ok!	
-	Feb 15 2009 	A little disappointed overall but plenty of positives.	Just come back from the Americana. I would have rated 7/10 but my good lady thought 5 at first but then 6 by departure.Pros; Location- close to Baker Street tube, 10 mins walk from Oxford Street/ Hyde Park, 2 mins walk to Regents Park. Very pleasant staff- complained about pokey double room so they gave us a nicer twin in the basement with no cafuffle. Bathrooms nice and modern with mosaic tiling. Reception area very nice with free coffee (not great, mind!), tea and apples- nice touch. Breakfast an ample continental with boiled eggs and a choice of cooked meats.Cons; First room tiny, once you get past the reception area, the light colour carpets and decor is not in a good state- in need of attention soon! Our second room was more spacious but walls and carpets badly marked, ceiling marked (!?), lots of cobwebs and bathroom a little grimy in the &quot;hard to get&quot; areas.I would go back, my good lady would at a push but she would prefer to return to the Astor Court if available.Highlights of break? Dinner at Langhans Bistro (fab) and late night kebabs from the peculiar kebab shop just over the road from hotel (small but incredibly tasty with home-made chips!).	
+	Nov 24 2009 	Highly recommend!	location - very very good! 1 min walk from earls court tube station which link to numbers of tubes. room - small but welcoming.. room was clean rating 4/5. decoration was ssimple but nice. the only down side i would say the bed was very hard n wasnt comfartable at all. the hot shower on the other hand was awesome! the water preassure was very very good.staff - was helpful at all timebreakfast - was catered in a small room downstair, the room was pretty small but didnt rwally bother us. the food was basic cereals, jmilk, uices, breads and jams.overall - locationwise? i would return if its just for short trip due to the location from the tube, but for more days i would probably look out for other options due to uncomfy bed..	
+	Sep 8 2008 	very hip - if you like that sort of thing	We stayed one night in this hotel late August, and found it to be comfortable and user-friendly. But its atmosphere leans more to the hip and funky than warm and welcoming, in my opinion. Plenty of positives to report: we arrived early and the staff gave us immediate access to a room, which was spacious enough; breakfast was complimentary and plentiful; location was ideal for walking 15 mins in most directions to landmarks like St Pauls, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre &amp; Tower of London. Also a few steps from Liverpool Street Tube station, which connects you to anywhere you want to go. But the hotel feels quite 'corporate' and a bit dark and shadowy for my liking. By contrast we stayed in the same week at Hotel Threadneedles around the corner, which had a much more traditional, comfy, club-like feeling (see my review on that if you like). In the end I think it boils down to personal taste &amp; style - cool &amp; funky versus warm and welcoming.	
-	Jun 24 2009 	We would suggest you avoid this hotel	The rooms at the front of this hotel are on a busy noisy road making sleep impossible. We had booked two nights and when we complained the first morning, the receptionist said we should have asked for a back room. If we wanted a back room, and to sleep that night, we needed to pay a lot extra. If we cancelled, we would lose half the cost of the room. Both rooms were small and basic. The second room was quiet.We were told that the attached restaurant had a 10% discount for hotel patrons. The restaurant also has a 15% mandatory tip!	
+	Oct 23 2009 	great location	Well located, well priced modern hotel. Very nice waiter served breakfast and professional service from all staff.	
+	Aug 12 2009 	Absolutely Fabulous	I was quite skeptical when I booked the hotel. After numerous reviews of dozen and dozens of London hotels, I had an impression that there is no way to get a nice hotel, with decent size of rooms and bathrooms, with A/C and in good location at my price range. I was so delighted when I entered my room at Apex of London. Very modern, clean and beautifully designed, good size of the room and bathroom. Bathroom had a bath tub and separate shower with all the modern appliances, granite counters, and big size toiletries. Free WiFi! Location just great  close walking distance to the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, and Themes River walk. Bus, Tour buses and tube stops just around the corner, and also river boats just next to the Tower. Nice restaurant downstairs and bar. Surprisingly quiet place although just steps from the major busy street. All the staff was very attentive and pleasant. Will definitely stay again. Planning trip to Edinburgh, hope Apex hotels there are as good.	
-	Jun 27 2005	Cheap and simple	I stayed in the Apollo, which is located in Bayswater for two nights. The best thing about this hotel is its price. The breakfast doesn´t taste average, the elevator got stuck two times, the public toillet is dirty and hard to find, the rooms are tiny, and you can hear the telephone ring one floor below.	
+	Jul 24 2003	Pleasant stay		
+	Oct 6 2005	Good deal from lastminite.com	Got a good deal from t'Internet - £130. Hotel location on Picadilly is great - right next door the the Sheraton. Check in was swift and friendly and room we were given was great.I think we got an upgrade to the &quot;normal&quot; discount rooms though, as we checked in quite early. We were on the 5th Floor to the side of the hotel. Good size room with excellent bathroom. All mod cons - including Digital TV, In room broadband Internet etc.MY Wife had breakfast in the hotel - quite pricey at £21 - I opted for a Coffee and Muffin from the nearby Starbucks and sat in Green Park watching the birds and squirrels play on a beautiful warm Autumn morning.All in all a good hotel for the money if booked on lastminite.com. Would probably suit the more &quot;mature&quot; traveller rather than a younger person coming to London.Would I stay again? - Yes.	
-	Jan 23 2006	Scaring	I've just come back from London where I spent 4 nights at this horrible hotel. We had booked a triple standard room at a very cheap price, but we couldn't imagine what we were going to find. The room was the filthiest and most horrible place I've ever been. It was small, dirty, awful, ugly. There was a hole in the wall and in the floor. The carpet was disappearing. The sheets and blankets were extremely old, the beds highly uncomfortable. we asked for a change but they told us they were full and that we were staying at the best standard room in the hotel. I'd like to see the others then, since ours was dreadful. Please, trust me, don't book a standard room there.	
+	Jul 7 2009 	Aww...... Bless them.....	These people try so hard!!! Bless them!I went to the Avonmore with a my mate Dave, we needed somewhere to put our heads down in between getting drunk and watching Blur in Hyde Park - and that was it. For 50 quid a night in the centre of London i really didnt expect much so i thought the Avonmore was fine.The staff are flippin lovely, the slightly camp fella on reception always had a smile on his face and a genuinely interesting line of chat for us. The foreign lady who ran the breakfast room was smart, alert and fairly efficient. She could do with a pen and pad though as she kept forgetting our order - but then again we were speaking English and it's obviously not her strongest point. They all felt genuine that was the main thing, like they actually gave a damn about the place. Most chain/franchise style cheap hotel's staff look like they're paid to grin inanely and make crap small talk nowadays.The hotel itself? Hmmm.... well..... You cant polish a turd but you can keep it clean and tidy. The decor was tired and mismatched, the furniture even more so - apart form the beds actually which were very comfy! The ensuite was bloody awful (but clean!), the shower curtain was minging and it was hard to sit on the loo without banging your knees on the opposite wall. Plus the fan didnt work so a bog the size of an understairs cupboard gets very hot, very quickly! We thought all the furniture was crooked till we realised the floor was actually sloping in from the edges as all the joists are obviously bowing with the age of the place. I've got a bigger screen on my mobile than the telly in the room too, plus the wardrobe only had 3 (mismatched - natch) coat hangers in it. The room was in fact tiny - especially since it was supposed to be a triple! The view was bloody awful too - but then again it is central London.So in summary? It's a dump. But it's a CLEAN dump, with lovely staff, comfy beds, and a great cooked breakfast all for 50 quid a night. If you're after a romantic break or even a family friendly base - avoid. If you need somewhere to get a kip in between racing around the heady sights of London you really have got a diamond in the rough here.	
+	Mar 19 2008	Wow!! - but room charges misleading!!	Just back from an amzing stay at the Baglioni Hotel. I decided to suprise my girlfriend with a trip to London for her Birthday. I chose this hotel from previous reviews and I was not dissapointed. Our driver had a bit of a problem finding the hotel as it has no big flashy signs or anything on the front facade, instead just a nice discreet entrance which is nice for such a hotel.Check -in is very friendly and efficient. If you need anything done or need any advice on where to go the concierge is very good. The rooms are really nice and the beds are so comfortable. You recieve all the usual amenties for a 5 star hotel like bathrobe, slippers, etc.. and in the evenings they have a turndown service and light candles in the bathroom. Didn't bother having breakfast in the hotel, instead we headed down the street to a really nice cafe called Giraffe which serve breakfast until 12pm which suited us perfectly. If you want to go shopping, a 2 minute walk will bring you onto High street Kensington where you have all the major shops like Zara, Topshop, Miss Sixty, starbucks etc.. so a great location. If your looking for some peace and quiet, Hyde park is right accross the road.The only downside to our stay was on checkout. The receptionist informed me that minibar had been used and i knew that i did not touch it. I was then told that 2 water were used. I told them that we had used the water on out bedside lockers thinking it was complimentary but I was informed that it is complimentary on the first night but not on the second!! For a 5 star hotel, this in my opinion was bad form. So i agreed to pay for it as I didnt want to cause any problems as it was only a couple of pounds. I find this very misleading as there was no signs in the room to suggest that bedside water is regarded as minibar.Apart from this i would 100 % consider staying here again, simply an amazing hotel! Hope this helps!	
+	Sep 30 2009 	Not a bad word to say against this hotel!	I recently travelled to London with my friend, and we had booked this hotel upon recommendation of her family. When we arrived, the staff were decent, and we were told our room was on the ground floor, which we were happy with. The room was at the end of a maze of corridors, and I was most definitely pleasantly surprised with what awaited us. The room was meant to be a twin room, but it had a double bed, as well as a single. It was clean, quiet and comfortable. We managed to get an excellent deal on the room, so were delighted with the quality. The only small complaint that I would have was that the carpet was worn away in one place, but the next day it had been covered by a mat.Breakfast was included in our offer, and it was grand. Location of the hotel was excellent - Earl's Court is a lovely area. honestly have no complaints at all.	
+	Sep 28 2009	Great location amazing customer service- definitely would stay here again!	My Mom, sister and I stayed in the triple for 2 nights at base2stay and we were really pleased. The location is very close to the tube and with great restaurants within walking distance. We have stayed in European hotels before this trip so we were aware of the room size when compared to American hotels but our bathroom was big!!! The hotel is very clean and new. There also was a sweet patio attached to our room which was a nice place to unwind before dinner. We would definitely stay here again!	
+	Sep 16 2009 	GREAT choice!	My husband and I chose base2stay based on location, value, room amenities and its high ranking on tripadvisor.com We were very happy with our choice! This was our third trip to London together and have stayed nearby previously; base2stay was nicer and less expensive. It's a super location just a 3-4 minute walk from Earl's Court tube stop which is on the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines for easy access to just about everywhere the usual tourist would want to see. Its location on the Piccadilly line means direct access to Heathrow in about 40 minutes with no stairs except for the four to the door of the hotel.Front desk was very friendly, yet professional; check-in and out very quick. As requested, we were given a room with a king bed (two twins &quot;zipped&quot; together and made up as a king) in a quiet location away from traffic, elevator, etc.Room small by US standards which is to be expected just about anywhere in London. Very well set-up, clean and comfortable. Tiny, efficient kitchenette with microwave, ref, dishes, cutlery for 2. Bathroom large by UK standards with a window which I liked for ventilation. Loved the heated towel rack. Big ledge for toiletries.Luggage storage space under the bed. Decent sized wardrobe for hanging clothes and a couple of shelves and drawers. We're not the types that completely unpack our suitcases into the available drawers, etc so we did notice there is not room to leave your suitcases out without crowding the room and in our case, blocking the kitchenette. Very nice linens and duvet, mattresses okay, but not great, which I mentioned to the hotel. Might be because of no box springs to allow for the storage space.Earl's Court area has many eateries;we love Nando's for chicken which is just 1 block west of the tube station (that's to the right as you're facing the station). The hotel does offer laundry service if you're desperate, but there is also a launderette around the corner. One BIG TIP to a happy international vacation is to PACK LIGHT!!All-in-all, a big thumbs up on base2stay. Only minor points are the mattresses not being at the same quality level as the rest of the room and the lack of suitcase space. Neither of these would keep us from booking this property again especially since we will NEVER over pack again!! Definately check out their website for more details, etc. Note-single rooms are tiny by US standards.	
+	Aug 26 2009 	Great service friendly clean modern quiet	We stayed for one night. The hotel looks practically new, and the entire place was spotless. Our room was lovely, very comfortable bed, the staff are friendly and eager to please, the hotel location is very convenient, yet on a quiet street. The decoration and furnishings are up-to-date and tasteful. Mini-kitchen is well stocked. In-room films are wonderfully priced, only 2 pounds. With heavy luggage the converted old house style of the hotel is ever-so-slightly inconvenient since there are 4-5 stairs to manoeuver, even with the good lifts, but not much can be done about that, I guess. Staff are the biggest asset, on duty 24 hours a day and full of wordly advice on local attractions, transportation, restaurants, supermarkets, etc. We walked to the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. 24-hour supermarket only 2 minutes away. We will definitely return.	
+	Apr 14 2009 	I'd like to keep it a secret....but....	I would like to keep it a secret, in fear that it may become too popular and create a different hotel (although, if they stick true to their philosophy, it will remain the same)...which is WONDERFUL!!!!The location is perfect for anyone loving the central city of London....and extremely perfect for the first time visitor. The convenience to Earl's Court tube as well as the local pubs, cafes, shops, and wonderful &quot;community feeling&quot; of the area could not be beat.The hotel will NOT disappoint you...the rooms are true to the web site...the mini kitchen is perfect and very handy....the beds very comfortable...the bathrooms modern and the showers are like a massage.We took out three different rooms for the group who traveled with us. ....Standand double, a Double/King, and a Deluxe (a dream come true for four people).The staff was helpful and fun...we hope to return to London in the near future and will stay no place else but base2stay!	
+	Jan 11 2009	Great value in heart of London	Finding an inexpensive hotel in London is next to impossible. That's why we were so pleased to find Base2Stay. It's near the Earl's Court tube, so the area around it isn't particularly cool, but it has great access to everything in London. The look of the hotel is minimalist chic, which makes the property feel much more upscale than its price tag would indicate. The rooms are very small and might be too confining for longer than a few days, but who spends much time in their room in London anyway?It was comfortable, quiet, and enabled us to get around easily without spending a bundle. I highly recommend it!	
+	Jul 6 2008 	Great comfort superb value	I recently stayed at Base2stay in London for a week and I loved it! I have stayed in many hotels but I have never experienced such a welcoming, accommodating and charming staff. The hotel is also beautiful, very Zen-like. My room offered every amenity I needed including a/c, a mini kitchen, which is a real bonus in an expensive city like London, a large flat-screen TV and easy to connect internet for my notebook; the bed was so comfortable that despite a 5 hour time difference with the US, I did not feel as jetlagged as I usually do. I travel to London quite often and this was the first time I stayed at Base2stay, however, it wont be the last. I truly enjoyed my time there and will, without hesitation, make it my hotel of choice each time I visit this beautiful city.	
-	Jun 8 2009 	nice staff shame about the polystrene cups	i booked with a travel agent ,cost 150 pound per night for a room 2 adults ,A 4 year old and one baby ,corridors smealt musty ,bathroom had papper bath mat and no safety rails in bath ,bathroomed cleaned daily but didnt get fresh towels daily as stayed 5 days ,sheets not changed daily but beds made daily .carpet wasnt hovered daily .but the thing that upset me the most was the tea and coffee faclitites ,cheap and no real cups polysterene ones .that leked when you but hot water in . had to buy my own whilst staying. on a good note nice area and reception satff were lovely .the staff make the hotel .	
-	Jan 4 2006	You get what you pay for	Stayed from Dec 27 till Jan 3. The rooms are the size of a room on a Cruise. Ample closet space,2 beds,small desk with 2 chairs,nice size bathroom with plenty of hot water and great water pressure. we were on the 2nd floor and there was no noise. The room was CLEAN and the beds were made every day and the 2 towells were replaced. The breakfast was very basic but it was FREE. The staff was polite. Long walk to the TUBE. Plenty of resturants nearby. Was not the RITZ but well worth the price	
-	May 10 2004	Do not go to this dump	First of all, DO NOT GO HERE.When we first arrived we were due to check in at 12pm, we had to wait until 3pm until the rooms were &quot;cleaned&quot;.Staff were unhelpful &amp; unfriendly especially the breakfast staff. The breakfast consisted of a bread roll, watered down orange juice &amp; disgusting tea. The reaction we received when asked for a slice of toast from the waitress was rude &amp; unacceptable. After paying £3 for scrambled eggs, one of our group got violently ill.Even though there was four people staying in our room, they only supplied us with two hand towels and a measley bar of soap for a shower. The bed sheets were not changed, which is unhygienic. The manager was very rude &amp; we would never stay here again even if it was free!	
-	Mar 13 2004	Lumpy beds noisy rooms	The hotel was brilliantly located - easy to get to from Heathrow, and then 2 tube stations down the road were so convenient. The area is lovely and quiet with a vibey main road just down the way. Hotel was OK for the price with a few exceptions - beds were diabolical - full of lumps. The rooms were noisy from the residents... make sure you get a room away from the lifts. The &quot;continental breakfast&quot; is a bit of a joke...coffee, a bread roll and watered down orange juice. I'd definitely stay in the area again, but I'd give another establishment a try.	
+	Jul 15 2008 	Hôtel tranquille		
-	Aug 2 2004	2 different hotel Bentincks- one is great	There is a Hotel Bentinck(aka bedstink) and the very pleasant Bentinck House hotel. Do not confuse the two- the one by Oxford Street is very nice.	
+	Sep 16 2006	Nice Hotel Good Located	The hotel has indeed small rooms (when comparing with US hotels as some other reviewers did) but sufficient space for us because we were there only to sleep. Hotel was clean but a bit old. Price was OK. Breakfast was OK. Very silent located. We stayed there three nights and were happy with the nearby subway (Queensway and Bayswater).	
-	May 14 2005 	Dont do it!	Good points? Great location just off Oxford Street but I would have to say that is the only good point.Decor of the lobby may be good if you could see through the cigar smoke. The room was horrific. Black ring around the bath, peeling paint, broken furniture, lumpy bed with one old blanket. When I asked for another the porter returned saying there weren't any more left. Guess the other cold guests got in before me.My booking told me that my room overlooked the courtyard - try litter strewn firestairs.I am amazed that this hotel is allowed to call itself a four star hotel, do yourself a favour and do NOT stay at this hotel.	
-	Jan 11 2006	The horror!!! The heat and street noise!!!	In Canada I read there was a sale at the Burns and stayed one night, all I could take, for 69 pounds. The street noise was hellish. The room was stifling and it was impossible to open the window. The room was extremely small with a hostel- sized bed. I could not put the chain on the door because it was broken. One light didn't work. The reception people were lovely. It was the hotel itself that was a big disappointment. I would never stay there again. I fled in the morning.	
-	Jan 3 2005	Crappy!	I wouldn't go back to this hotel if someone PAID me!The staff was nice and all, but one night i saw a homeless person sleeping outside my window.I went and complained but they said they couldn't do anything about it.The food was horrible and the room was no bigger than a closet!	
-	Nov 8 2004	Our room smelled as though there was a dead rat in it.		
-	Mar 24 2008 	Good location but very disappointing.......	Stayed here for a Saturday night with my partner.The location is very good directly opposite Hyde Park and at the top end of Kensington High Street but really this is the only good thing to say about the hotel.When we arrived at the reception to book in the attitude of the receptionist was very unfriendly however she advised us that we had been upgraded to a bigger room.When we got to the room on the 4th floor, via possibly the smallest lift ever made, we saw from the notice on the door that we had an Apartment (?) When we got inside the place looked and smelt like it had not been used for weeks.Both the bathroom and the main bedroom were ok with fresh sheets, but the rest of the apartment was very dirty and the kitchenette was falling apart. Thewhole place looked like it was lived during the week possibly by staff and let out to guests at weekends.When we got back form our evening out we asked the guy on reception if room service was still available. It was 11.15pm and he said there was 24hr service. When we got to our room i rang and ordered some coffee and something to eat. I was told it would be with us within 20mins.After 40mins we were told that the order had only just been given to the kitchen and that there would be another 40min wait. By this time we were not too concerned about room service and so i told them politly not too worry. At hearing this the guy on the end of the of the phone started ranting and raving. I could not believe what he was saying and asked him to calm down. This just set him off even more.We decided to go and get something to eat ourselves in the High Street. When we got down to the reception my girlfriend mentioned what happened to the night reception. He was not concerned at all.I can see from other comments on here about this hotel that there have bee problems with the staff in the bar so perhaps we should not be too surprised. But a hotel in this part of London needs to be a lot better at customer service and room cleanliness.Be careful, stay in a normal room and whatever you do don't ask for Room Service...........	
+	Aug 12 2009 	Great location near everything !	This hotel is in a great location just minutes from Oxford street and the bus stops and tube stations of Marble Arch. Would recommend Saint Christopher's Place for an inexpensive place to eat after a day of site seeing. It is five minutes walk from the hotel. Our room was very clean and was quite big for a city centre hotel. The air conditioning did break on our second night but the staff did try to accomadate us as best they could with a fan. It was fixed by our final nights stay !	
+	Oct 16 2004	Great hotel I will come back for sure!!!		
+	Aug 7 2004	Price good but hotel very average	Arrived early (0600) and asked what time I could ckeck in. I was told (by the rude and unfriendly staff - people that the whole of England can be proud of) that a room would be available at 1100. When I returned at 1100 I spent the next 3 hours waiting for the room. The room was extremely small, even by English standards, but it was clean and functional. There was not enough room to have two bags on the floor.The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. The shower was enclosed in glass and I could not turn around without breathin in - I am very tall. The water temperature was hard to control so I ended up scalding myself as I could not get away from the water without getting out of the shower. In the end I showered with the door open.The breakfast wasn't worth waiting for and in the end I just breakfasted at small cafes in the area.All in all the hotel would not suit those used to Asian and American hotels. It is, however, OK if you get a cheap rate as it is convenient.	
+	Jan 4 2009 	great inexpensive hotel	We booked this hotel as a package through BA. To be honest, I was worried with the rating. We usually do 5 stars in Europe. We were very happy with the location, Short walk to tube, and very convenient to many restuarants. The room was suprisingly large with a new bathroom and a loft area for my teenage daughter. The staff was over the top helpful!!! They even included breakfast :)	
+	Aug 19 2008	Great value family room	Great location close to Bayswater tube. Booked on the morning of my stay with LateRooms and got a room for 4 people for well under £100. Ideal for our family - breakfast was better than expected as well!!Great places to eat in Queensway, so altogether a great location.	
+	Nov 10 2007 	A week at the Phoenix	The Best Western Phoenix Hotel is located a few blocks from both the Bayswater and Queensway Underground stations. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable of the local area. The room was a double and was fairly small, but adequate. The shower entrance was unbelievably small and very difficult to get into. There are many restaurants, stores, fast food chains within walking distance. Although it is expensive I recommend Bella Italia which is 1 block away, if you like Italian food. I rated this hotel as average only because there are much better hotels available, but I would highly recommend this hotel and I would stay again. I paid about $430 for 7 days which is fairly priced.	
+	Nov 10 2003	Great Location!		
+	Feb 23 2009 	Great room nice hotel.	I stayed here for one night in dec 08. The hotel was clean the room was very nice and the bathroom was really something special. We booked the cheapest deal we could find so while the room was lovely it was on the ground floor and over looked a very small and unpleasant concrete &quot;garden&quot;. The corridors were dark and small but all the public areas were large and bright. Its about a 5 min walk from Paddington station and was surprisingly easy to find despite having to cross several major roads. We walked to the statue of Peter Pan in Hyde Park, The Royal Albert Hall and Harrods in Knightsbridge (at a tourists pace) in just over an hour. The buffet breakfast was also very nice. There is also a great pharmacy a few yards from the door that sells very reasonable perfume. The staff were more than helpful and I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and to recommend it to others.	
+	Oct 27 2009 	nice hotel - nice price - shame I was locked out	It's not luxury but good for the £65 per night paid. Room large and clean, quaintly decorated. Finding way around hotel difficult, very higgledy piggledy small corridors and tiny lift. Close to tube in a lovely quiet, safe area.Paid for cheap advance reservation but despite saying in confirmation email that they charge the card immediately they didn't with me. What happened is that me and hubby checked in, went to our gig, came back just after midnight and our card wouldn't open our bedroom door. Went down to reception, waited 15 minutes until the only member of staff had served customers at the bar, explained our problem and was abruptly told the reason we'd been locked out was that my credit card had been refused when they tried to take payment. I was surprised because thought I had paid before arriving and card had lots in the account. I was tired and just wanted a bed so I didn't argue and I insisted on trying the card again and low and behold it cleared no problem. Got to bed by about 1am but next morning had to phone my bank to check I hadn't paid twice (I hadn't). Make of this review what you will. It's a nice hotel for the money, but is the potential hassle worth it??? Oh yeah there is free wifi, ask for the code at reception - I think they change the code each morning though so if you get the code in the evening then want to check something on the internet when you get up in the morning, it doesn't work, signal wasn't great in our room either.	
-	Oct 22 2005	I slept in a cupboard!	Teeny weeny room that just fitted the bed....a shower which was up 4 large steps...after confessing my mistake to colleagues , they also admitted to having stayed here and hating it!Do not be fooled by the best Western branding and brilliant price compared to others...it is truely awful!I did not sleep...bedroom boiling despite wndow wide openBreakfast more than depressing!i left an hour and a half before my train as i prefered to sit at the station.Horrible, horrible, horribleDO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!	
-	May 9 2009 	The Cupboard Under The Stairs!	The &quot;room&quot; was TINY, but clean. The length of 2.5 beds and the width of one arm span. Bathroom nearly killed us with heat/steam unless the door was open, which was not an option given we are two ladies who prefer private showers! Noisy, next to the lift. Breakfast room was inadequate for the amount of people staying so get in early to get a table. Milk was almost curdled with warmth...ew! Heating worked, but was totally unnecessary in April! At least the window opened in our cell!	
-	Jun 14 2005 	Far from the best	This is not a hotel I'd recommend for anything other than an urgent overnight stay when there's nothing available. Made from a number of houses joined together there are four different staircases and the interior is maze like - finding your room can be a challenge involving many many stairs. Small rooms and very small shower pods, but generally what you'd expect for £45 per night in central London - if you paid more than that you could have stayed elsewhere. Would get a lower rating at any price over £50I would go back if there's nowhere else nearby as the location is good.	
-	Apr 23 2008	Average	This hotel has a good location, 10 minutes walk from Paddington Station. As with other reviewers i thought that the entrance lobby was nice and had high hopes for my room. However, the room itself was tiny and the bathroom was so small that the sink was actually in the bedroom! The walls are also paper thin so be prepared to be able to hear conversations (and bathroom business!) of people three rooms away or a floor above/ below you. The heat is also permananetly on so we had to leave our window open all night- great when the builders/ scaffolders working on the hotel redevelopment start work at the crack of dawn!I booked a reasonable package to stay at this hotel but beware of paying full price. A good location but defintiely needs some improving.	
-	Dec 7 2004	the best and the worst	My husband and I spent three nights at Number Fourteen Hotel between 3-6 December.GOOD POINTS : We like the area very much. It is a 10-minute walk to Portobello Market, to Hyde Park or to the shops, and restaurants. There are two pubs round the corner. There are three underground lines connecting at Notting Hill station. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. Our bedroom was nice and clean, and well-equipped, there were a fridge and a hair-dryer but it was next to the breakfast room.The breakfast room is very nicely decorated as it was renovated recently. There is no cooked breakfast but toast, cereals, juice and canned fruit. BAD POINTS : The hotel is not quiet because of the trains running under the hotel.There is no restaurant and we did not expect to find guests celebrating a birthday party in the breakfast room at 9:00 pm when we got back to the hotel on the second night. The following morning, we complained about the noise because they stopped the music at 1:00 am but the noise went on until 3:00. The management gave us a 50% rebate and admitted that they should not hold parties again if there were guests occupying the G3 room - room n°3 on the ground floor. We will consider staying in this hotel another time provided we get a room on the first or second floors and that no parties are to be organised. We could also try the Chelsea House which is its sister hotel.	
+	Aug 20 2004	Wonderful charming.... PERFECT!!!!	I don't understand some of the reviews on this place. We stayed 2 weeks, and everyday was PERFECT!!! They let us check in 30 minutes early, they reserved a room at the back of the hotel (as I requested), breakfast was on time, delicious, filling and free, plenty of hot water EVERY morning (that's rare in UK), great satellite TV, AC (also very rare), great location, staff was first rate but most importantly... clean!!!The staff was friendly, helpful, cheerful and very hard working!!! I have stayed in many hotels, and by far, they were the best!!!! I'm picky!!!! I like everything to be clean.... you could say I have issues. lol Room was cleaned DAILY! AC worked and worked well. The 14 days were there, the weather was very muggy and we kept the AC on all day while we were out, so we came home to a nice and cool room. TV was much better than other hotels... great stations (I believe there were 10) and the reception was great! Hot water in the shower EVERY morning!!! A huge plus and very rare!! Breakfast is served from 8:00 - 9:30 am every morning!!! It consists of cereal (if desired), a basket of toast (5 pieces cut in half) which you may have refills of if needed, orange juice, coffee, tea, milk, water or hot chocolate which my daughter said it was the best she'd ever had!!!Now, some people have complained that the rooms are small... this is true, however, this building and surrounding buildings, were built hundreds of years ago... (England, especially London is very old) so to say that they even have a shower is impressive, but one that works without constant repair is amazing!!!Now for the fish and chip shop across the road... called &quot;Mickey's Fish and Chips&quot;... DELICIOUS AND VERY WELL PRICED!!!! One order of chips is enough to feed two people for 1 pound!! The cheeseburger was 95 pence!!I know this review is a little long, but I agree with the last reviewer, you do need to &quot;understand what you are going to get&quot; fully, so you can make up your own mind!!! I have no trouble recommending this place to anyone!! I guess you just can't please some guests, so don't worry about the few negative reviews.	
-	Jul 9 2009 	Lovely location - nasty hotel	My company put me up here for a few nights in June, and I was not too happy about it!The location is great. Lovely wealthy area and lots of nice restaurants and a few shops nearby. Within Zone 1 and a choice of 2 tube stations with only a few stops to get into Central London. Free car parking is very good - however, you need to get to the hotel before 5 to secure a space or you'll need to find a space on the road which is pay &amp; display until about 6pm. The car parking spaces are also very small and awkward to fit in.The hotel itself is pretty nasty. Very dated and not particularly clean. The bedrooms have floral walls, floral carpet, floral curtains and dark wood furniture so they feel very chintzy and claustrophobic and smell a bit fusty and you can hear very clearly what's going on in the next rooms. It needs a good refurb. Had a problem with the bed in the room and the night staff were very rude and un-helpful.Breakfast was pretty awful - I'd recommend going to one of the nice cafe's up the road instead. The tea and coffee (if you can call it that) in the jugs was awful, and the cooked breakfast looked like it had been out under the lights for hours.Overall - if you just want a cheap bed for the night and don't plan to spend much time there, then ok, but I would not recommend for a leisure stay.	
-	Oct 25 2009 	A promising exterior but seriously lacking inside	I stayed here with friends for one night &amp; that was more than enough.The room was a good size, but dated and poorly sound-proofed. We were kept awake at night by the DLR and extremely noisy air-con, then woken by the noise from the construction site next door, then a cleaner letting herself into the room at 8am. We pre-booked the continental breakfast at £6 per head, which consisted of oily croissants, two cereals, some rolls and processed cheese, along with horrendous coffee and stewed tea.This hotel claims a four-star rating - I've stayed in two-star accommodations that have been far better.	
+	Jun 17 2008 	Nice hotel comfortable beds in ok location	Hotel is nice, clean and has lovely views of Canary Wharf. If you are visiting London from outside UK, I wouldn't reccommend it as you will have to find local tube links and at night this could be difficult. It is niced to stay near Christmas as it is close to the Canary Wharf Ice Rink.Hotel itself is comfort and plesant. I wouldn't pay more than £80 a night though, as you can get better hotels in the Centre of the West End.	
+	Oct 22 2009 	Perfect Location	A perfect location for The Royal Brompton Hospital. Perfect for a one nights stay. Hotel room very clean and adequate for our needs and it was nice to have breakfast in the room. Would recommend as value for money and closeness to tube.	
+	Mar 6 2007	Comfortable inexpensive no-frills but nice	I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights with my mother and it was a decent stay. The room was Very small, but the hotel has an English charm to it. It's more like a house than the large hotel chains most Americans are probably familiar with.The room, as I said, was very small, and my mother and I had to share a double bed. But this is what we booked, so it's what I expected. The room had the regular comforts, TV, etc., adequate bathroom and all. Nothing fantastic but adequate and comfortable. My only complaint about the room was that our bed was very very hard.I enjoyed the breakfast, but it was very basic. Yogurt, toast, tea, coffee, juice, cereal and all that. Didn't spring for the English breakfast, but the free breakfast was filling. The neighborhood is mostly a lot of other similar hotels and seemed very safe. Kensington Palace is a block away with beautiful gardens, even in the misty rain (what else would you expect?) There are several local restaurants around and the underground station was a short walk. We got a deal by going in the off season and booking our flight at the same time, and we had a good time. This place isn't anything special, but the staff was very friendly with us and helped us book our transportation and allowed us to store our baggage for free after we checked out. If you're on a budget but don't want a gross sketchy place, this is a nice comfortable no-frills option.From London Heathrow airport we took the Heathrow Express to Paddington station (you can buy tickets at the airport), then walked to the hotel. It was a little longer walk than we expected, so we took a taxi to the station on the way home. Still, an easy journey. A round trip fare on the Heathrow Express train was about 30 pounds and the taxi fare was 7. We spoke to some travelers at the hotel who took a taxi straight from the airport and they said their fare was about $100 US, so we definitely got the better deal, and didn't really spend any more time or aggravation.	
+	Aug 28 2009 	Simply Excellent	Great Hotel...Best Bar service...Amazing breakfast...Highly recommended...	
+	Aug 26 2009 	Cadogan is simply a leisure hotel	with prime location in the heart of London, friendly personnel and excelent and attentive F&amp;B service from the first step in, lovely and cosy feeling all make the this lovely Hotel my very favourate.	
-	Feb 27 2008 	Need management change	Surprised by our stay in this lovely hotel, which used to be Lilly Langtry's house. The day manager is difficult. We were in a very small room in which nothing worked (including the shower television and telephone) and it took him three days to change our room. We were not able to change hotels as we had sadly booked on Expedia (which we have learned is not a good way to go-- you are usually stuck with the least desirable room, since the hotel knows you can't get out of your booking).The night manager was wonderful, and made up for our grouchiness-- he upgraded us to a lovely room with breakfast included. The day manager however and even GM were not too courteous from that moment on, when they discovered that the night manager had given us more than the price we were paying , and this made us uncomfortable when we would see them walking around--(hotel is quite small). All this made my husband say he wouldn't go back. It's too bad, as I have fond memories of having had lovely teas there (they have very nice scones.)	
+	Sep 7 2008 	Cheap cheerful and central!	Myself and a few friends all booked rooms at this hotel on a Friday night as we had tickets to Ash perform at the Roundhouse. The hotel was perfect for us. It is literally just over the road from the Roundhouse, approximately 10 mins walk up to Camden market and there are a few good reasonable places to eat. We had dinner at a Belgian restauarant nearby which was fairly cheap and good food. The pub just opposite the hotel the enterprise was great. really lovely atmosphere and great DJ (Sue)- seem to remember dancing around to sound of music songs at around 1am- very random! We were up for a night out and went to bed around 2am so didn't have any trouble with noise. The rooms were small but clean and at the end of the day exactly what we wee needing. We paid £68 for the double room which for it's location was great!	
+	May 31 2007 	Great location great price	We just returned from a five week trip to England and Ireland. We started at the Cardiff. The staff (Alex, Agnes and Nara) were fantastic. They made this average hotel above average. We were able to obtain a rate of $136/night because we stayed five nights and the fifth night was free. We had a small (but adequate) room upstairs but our friends had a larger room on the first floor. Everything was clean, water pressure in the shower was fine. It was a quiet location, but had restaurents close by. Also close by were Paddington Station (London metro and trains to Windsor and Oxford), bus stop and Kensington/Hyde Parks. Breakfast was a nice buffet for cold items and a full hot English breakfast.	
+	Mar 21 2005	Best Value in London!	Our family of four found the Cardiff to be a real gem. I chose the Cardiff because of its proximity to Paddington station but found that that was not the main benefit of staying there. We were only there for one night as we had a stayover between airports being brought in at Gatwick and flown out of Heathrow. Although the Paddington train station is just a couple blocks away, we found that using the Tube to get to Heathrow was just as easy. It may take more time, but the Tube was much, much cheaper and only involved one transfer. (A serious consideration due to the current exchange rate!)Upon arrival by cab, we were greated most appreciatively and made to feel welcome. My teenage daughters felt so at home they decided not to leave for dinner. They would rather watch the tele! We found the variety of restaurants in the area to be exceptional. Everything is quite convenient in the area as there are many stores close by. We also enjoyed our first English breakfast there and were treated most kindly by our server who was very helpful to us first-timers.We loved the park right out the front door, the very pleasant staff, the cleanliness, and the location of the Cardiff and we would most certainly return.	
+	May 31 2009 	Desayuno increible		
-	Jul 27 2009 	Tiny room no elevator nor aircon	This hotel is nicely located, metro is about 400m away and you can walk to Hyde park and Marble Arch. There is a bus tourist company which drives just behind the corner. But nothing else can be recommended. Hotel is small and our room at the highest floor was smallest we have ever been to. It felt like the wall would fall on us. And because we were on top floor, of course there was no elevator working that time. Maybe it was under construction because there was some renovation going on at some other floors. Stairs were narrow too. Aircondition wasn`t working either. There was not much help of the small window. Room has been renewed lately, but it felt like beeing in a c-class cabin in cruise ship, unfortunately. Breakfast was so and so, some day they were out of some of their basic products. Staff was friendly both in reception and breakfast room.If you are interested in this hotel, make sure that aircon is working and you get bigger room than what we got. We won´t go there again.	
-	Jan 31 2005	Is the gummy bear still there?	Stayed here for five nights in November 2002. Blech. Our room was located through 14 (yes really) doors, down an alley in another building. Dirty Dirty Dirty. I guess the staff didn't think it was necessary to clean our room, since the green gummy bear on the floor just inside the door when we arrived stayed through our entire stay! Our sink leaked, and the bathroom was a modular unit -- you could sit on the potty and take a shower at the same time. The room was so small that there wasn't room to lay our suitcases flat on the floor to open them.The location is not that great -- a walk from Victoria or Pimlico stations. Internet cafe is clear up at Victoria.The little convenience store across the street was robbed while we were there.The continental breakfast consisted of the worst juice I've ever tasted (worse than mcdonalds) and bad cereal--not even the Muesli staple was offered. Oddly there are some okay rooms in this hotel tho -- my parents missed their connecting flight and arrived sometime later than we did. Even though my husband and I arrived several hours earlier, the staff wouldn't move us even when we asked &quot;we're all booked up&quot; (we looked young enough to hike the stairs I guess). My folks' room was accessible by a lift, and was at least 3x the size of ours. It was a much cleaner room, a fact we blamed on it being more accessible than ours. The bathroom was modular, but normal sized. Their only complaint was that the floor sloped, and there was no shower curtain. Think bad Motel 6.So would I recommend it -- NO. But if you get this in a package (like we did with (---)) demand to be in the main part of the hotel where it's cleaner -- no travel through alleys.	
+	Sep 15 2007	Excellent Hotel	Booked for 6 nights at the Thistle Charing Cross for 119 pounds/night plus breakfast. At check-in, I was offered the upgrade to a junior suite for 35pounds/night which i accepted. there's also an upgrade to a exec king for only 20 pounds/night, but you have to ask for it.before i took the upgrade, i did look at the double deluxe room that i booked and it was acceptable as well - it was about the size of a typical manhattan hotel room. but i decided to splurge a little bit for the extra room.the junior suite had a king bed and a separate living room area. my room however, faced the street and it was quite noisy as london stays active for most of the night.The second night I requested a quieter room. They actually have a quiet room category. Next time i'll definitely request it. It was a lot smaller than the junior suite I originally had. it looked more like the exec room. since quiet was a lot more important than space, i didn't make too much of a fuss even if i did get bamboozled.the free breakfast was quite good. eggs, sausage, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, toast, coffee, cereal, fruit, and deli meats. i wouldn't pay 17.50 pounds though for it when you can get an english breakfast for about 5 pounds across the street.the location was wonderful. you have access to the rail system as well as the underground system literally a stone's throw away. leicester square and picadilly stations are within a 10 min walk as well.tons of shopping and restaurants nearby. i ate regularly at the mcdonalds about 150 feet from the hotel since british food stinks.if i could, i'd actually rate this hotel a 4.5. Definitely a good value play if you can get a decent rate. walk up rates were as high as 350 pounds per night!!	
+	Aug 16 2007 	Ideal Location	Stayed here for a long weekend to see some shows.Location was perfect for Theatreland - the shows we saw - Lord of the Rings (MUST SEE) and Fiddler on the Roof were about 10min away.Just round corner from Trafalgar Square &amp; Buckingham Palace and Westminster within a short walk.Built over the Charing Cross Station but not too noisy at all.We upgraded to an Executive room on arrival for £35 per night - included a bottle of wine each day and was a very comfortable room which we thought was worth the extra - we effectively paid a total of about £140 per night for a double including breakfast and wine.	
+	Feb 28 2007	Very Comfortable Perfect Location!	Stayed here Feb 17 - 23, 2007. The room was small by American standards, but Very comfortable and completely met our needs. We were coming from 10 days in India so a soft bed, clean restroom and shower, and clean hot water was truly welcome. I was concerned ahead of time that with the hotel sitting on top of the train station it might be noisy, but not so.The hotel seems to cater to business travelers, but for tourists the location couldn't be better. London is such a dynamic city and this hotel puts you only a few minutes walking distance to everything. And what isn't easy walking distance is a quick Tube ride from right outside the front door.The only downside was that our great promotional rate for the room did not include breakfast. After our first morning breakfast bill of $65 for the two of us, we decided to eat out of the hotel the rest of the time. But with the shops and restaurants of the west end just a few blocks away, it wasn't a problem at all. The staff was friendly and helpful, check-in and out was a breeze and we'd go back here in a heartbeat simply because of it's fantastic location as a launching point the this great city.D.

+	Oct 22 2007	What a gem...	Amazing rooms, beautifully appointed in a relaxed yet fashionable style with none of the pretence of other London 5 stars.They have adorable extras in all the rooms (eye masks, lavender pillow sprays, beautiful toiletries, hangover kits in the minibar).The location is fab for bars and restaurants in Fitzrovia and the hotel itself has a bar which is a hit with post work drinkers. The breakfasts were great and the service polished and efficient and I would reccomend this hotel to anyone very highly (though would note for siteseeing and high end shopping e.g. Bond Street &amp; Knightsbridge) the location is not the best.A hotel not to be missed, I would return again, and again...	
+	Jan 17 2009	Chester is adequate	Good location near Victoria Station. No breakfast although I found it through a B&amp;B website. Couldn't get into the room early after flying all night. Room was ok.	
-	Jan 17 2006	Carpeted bathrooms	My company office is in Chiswick &amp; I've been coming here on and off for years. The lack of hotels in Chiswick (this is the only one) and the mediocre f/b I've had on this hotel long deterred me from staying here and I tended to stay in central London and taxi out. However, laziness recently prevailed and I stayed in the Chiswick hotel several times in the last few months.It's generally OK- 2-3 stars, cramped, a bit noisy, light and sound under the ill-fitting doors. A typical mediocre London hotel, but pricey for that at circa STG80-100.What has just put me off entirely is that the bathrooms are carpeted. I'm no Howard Hughes, but this just isn't sanitary. I hate having to wear my shoes around the room and to go to the bathroom and on my last stay I just couldn't bring myself to shower. So henceforth it's back to the commute from London.	
-	Oct 13 2009 	Stylish convenience lacks service	From the outside the hotel looks smart and when you enter you get the LA feel that is mentioned on their website. However the experience deteriorates when you make contact the with the staff.I arrived early for check in and was told to wait around until a room became available as guests were just starting to check out. I sat in the lobby catching up with paperwork for an hour before seeking an update on my situation. The staff member (who it seems had forgotten me) advised that my room would be ready in 15 minutes. After half an hour I went back up to the front desk again - the original staff member had now gone on her lunch break and forgotten me again - and was finally checked in.The room was very stylish and certainly met the chic boutique expectations with the funky light fittings and furry carpet. The bathroom was spacious and the bath itself was a good size. The shower was large but the tiled floor had limescale deposits in some areas. The bed was hard but duvet comfortable and the the tea/coffee facilities were good and finished in a nice shiny chrome effect.The breakfast was very dissapointing; staff were weary and barely managed to say hello, and the croissants were small and lacked flavour. Overall, the hotel was an excellent location (2 mins from the tube station) and the room was comfortable but the staff seemed poorly trained.	
+	Feb 7 2007 	Excellent location	Citadines Trafalgar square was ok. We were on a weekend break and stayed in a studio, room 517. From the window there was absolutely no view, but the room was on a quiet side of the building so we got a good night's sleep. Room was ok, a bit small, but bigger than in London usuaylly. I've stayed in various hotels in London and Citadines is the best by far. We didin't cook but we appreciated water boiler so we could make ourselves a cup of tee. Also the fridge was nice, and there was a Tesco market at Trafalgar square to buy sandwitches from. If you want to eat breakfast downstairs, it costs 9 pounds - expensive.The bathroom was big and clean. Only problem was that the tap in the shower was really tight. You had to lift it with all your strenght to get the water to come out. At first we didn't and thought the shower was broken, so we got moved to a room 410. There we tried the tap and noticed that you need to use a lot of strenght. So we asked to get back to room 517 which felt like a nicer room. The staff was friendly and helpful. We asked for the information about a bus going to Liverpoolstr. Station and the person checking us out double checked that we had got the information and knew where to go. All in all a very good experience to stay at Citadines. Would definetely recommend it to my friends and will stay in it again.	
+	Jun 15 2006	a great place to stay!!	Great location, close to the tube station, grocery store, bakery just two blocks away. Royal Albert Hall is 5 min walk , Harrods 15 min. Get a tube pass which includes the bus (stop accross the street) My sister and I stayed there for 10 days and felt it was our home away from home. The staff are friendly and helpful .We had planned to cook our dinners in, that didn't last long as we found so many restaurants within easy walking distance. After touring the busy parts of the city it was great to come &quot;home&quot; and re-group in our quiet, cosy surrondings. Our unit was a located on the first floor, with bedroom and bathroom upstairs, kitchen and sitting area, with TV downstairs. Wireless internet is available in the lobby, which been a non smoker I found it hard to spend too much time there, but I understand they are in the process of installing connection in the rooms. My next stay to London will definetly include the Citidines Kennsington.	
+	Mar 21 2006	Great location a few things left to be desired	I'm happy to report big improvements in staff and in room quality over last year. Staff was polite, cheerful, and helpful, and the room was brighter, cleaner, and more pleasant. All of the good things from last year -- the relative quietness of the rooms on noisy Northumberland Ave., the big bathroom, and well-equipped kitchen, were all still in evidence. With this in mind, I'd love to give this place another star, but I can't. Why, you may ask. I'll tell you: I had the bed from hell. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that the beds they have in hell are probably more comfy than the one I had. My standards are not particularly high, mind you. I know that the studios have sofabeds, and in the past I've found them acceptable, although certainly not the most comfortable. This bed, though, was not only uncomfortable but in bad repair (the mattress support panel would regularly fall through leaving in peril of falling through to the floor), and it bespeaks a certain lack of regard for the guests that the hotel would pass off this kind of Inquisitorial torture device as something acceptable to sleep on. Even with this unpleasant bed business, I find myself in awe of the location and the general value the hotel offers for the money. I just wish they didn't coast on the &quot;location&quot; angle so much, and tried a little bit harder.	
-	Jun 12 2006	Avoid if possible	I only stayed here one night (thankfully), and was glad that I did not have to spend too much time here. On the plus side, the hotel is very close to the Earls Court tube station, so getting there is quite easy. With a large suitcase and backpack it took me less then 5 minutes to get to the hotel from the station. The Comfort Inn is anything but, the inside of the hotel was like a sauna. The hotel was quite rundown, and is greatly in need of some renos. I booked a single room as I was travelling alone, but I was still surprised at the size of the room. It was very long and narrow ( I could almost touch the opposite walls with my arms extended. Carpets in the room were stained and the room smelt a bit funny (especially the bathroom). Thankfully the bedding was clean. I was lucky enough to have an air conditioning unit in my room as it was quite warm that night. Unfortunately it was extremely loud, and I could not find any controls to adjust it, which made falling asleep a little hard. The fire/door alarm that went off at about 3:30am didn't help much either. The clerks that checked me in and out were friendly enough, although in the morning there was a rather shabby looking man in the back office that kept on yelling at the young lady that was checking me out. For the price I paid (aprox $140 CAD), I did not find this hotel worth it, and would not stay here again.	
+	May 6 2005	Nice days in London	We stayed here for three nights in May 2005 in a triple-room with a small but functional and clean!!! bathroom.The hotel is very close to Earls Court Tube Station with lots of shops and restaurants on the way. We didn´t hear any noise from the Tube in our hotel!!! This place was nice with friendly atmosphere. You get a beautiful clean!!! room, nice location, helpful staff and an excellent Continental Buffet Breakfast.Check In 2:00 p.m Check Out 11:00 a.mW´ll stay again!	
+	Dec 28 2005	bagels	We always stay at the City Hotel,Visitors should be aware that it is situated in the East End the area can appear seedy to a newcomer but with an open mind you will have the chance to experience real London.The hotel staff are friendly and efficient,rooms spacious and clean,ample buffet breakfast.lively bar attached with a pleasant atmosphere.Good public transport links to the West End try the 25 bus and see some famous London landmarks including St.Pauls cathedral.	
-	Jul 11 2009 	Expensive but not sure we would stay again	Claridge's is above all a name. All the celebs stay there, so for my boyfriend's birthday I thought I would treat him and see what all the fuss was about. We were ready to check in at 2pm and told that our room was not ready. Good start. We went for lunch and were told I would recieve a phonecall on my mobile when the room was ready - certainly within the hour. We did not receive a phonecall. By 3.45pm we went back to the hotel - we were concerned about the time since we were due to go out at 6pm - and although our room was ready (just as well otherwise I would not have been happy) we received no form of apology. This is supposed to be the best hotel in London! At the time I did not make a fuss but for what you pay per night, we had lost a couple of hours in our room which equated to a good few drinks in the bar! To top it off our air conditioning did not work and we had a very hot and uncomfortable nights sleep.Moaning aside it is a beautiful hotel and great location but be prepared to pay over the odds for everything. £31 for an full english breakfast? I don't think so. If you make a reservation make sure money is not a problem. Also, if you write a complaint letter to the mangement after your stay, expect to not receive a reply - I am still waiting to hear back after my letter dated 25th May! Will let you know if I receive any form of response but to be honest, I'm not expecting it!	
+	May 4 2009 	Undoubtedly the best hotel in London...	I travel all around the world for business or leisure. I often stay at luxury hotels as I really pay attention to details that make you feel the hotel is worth every penny.There are many 5 stars hotels in London. Most of them state they are the best in town, they are second to none...According to me, most of the London 5 stars hotels are old fashonned. They lack serious overall renovations or refurbishings. The Dorechester is among these hotels as it provides an excellent service but has old fashonned furnitures. Contrary to Paris that has 5 to 7 real palaces (outstanding building, beautiful furnitures, excellent food, premier service...), London can not boast with a real palace that exceeds common luxury standards...except the CLARIDGES.My wife and I wanted to stay in a Mayfair hotel. This area is located in the center of london's main attractions. In that point, the Claridges hotel is perfectly situated.We wanted to stay in a moden / art deco room in a hotel where service quality still has a sense. We reserved a Claridges suite designed by David Linley, a genius furniture designer.We arrived in London early in the morning. A Bentley limousine was waiting for us. The driver was friendly and class.At the hotel, they upgraded us with a Linley suite that is one of the best modern / art deco style suite of the hotel. A bottle of champagne, a fruit plate and flowers were put in our suite.During our stay, we tested the staff. Our butler together with the concierges were very professional and friendly. They showed they paid attention to our requests. We ordered food via the room service ad we also eated at the main restaurant. Everything was perfect. Food quality was great like in many french palaces.As a summary, we spent 3 unforgettable days in that hotel. The Claridges is definitely the best hotel in London. It is a perfect gateway for people expecting the best.Thank you very much to the hotel's staff	
-	Aug 21 2007 	well worn	my wife and i stayed in room 144 .the view from the window was terrible over looking fans and windows with paint flaking along with dozens of cigarette butts directly outside our window.the carpet in the bedroom was worn and splitting .the bathtub had paint peeling from it .the room was very dreary and dark,it is the only five star hotel i have ever stayed in that does not leave mineral water beside the bed at turndown.breakfast is taken in the lobby with a gale blowing through the front door.i think this hotel is living on its past and needs a urgent refurbishment.in london i would say to stay in browns or the dorchester hotels for a much superior product.	
-	Jun 15 2006 	Poor Ventilation	I have stayed at this hotel on two occasions and found it very convenient for business purposes. However, during both stays I developed a sinus infection that was very painful and a nagging cough that kept me up at night. I originally though that I had simply caught a cold during my travels, until I realized that my sinuses would clear up during the day while at the office. The problem got worse the longer I stayed, and I actually had serious asthma attacks on my final two nights. I have never suffered from allergies or asthma, so it was quite a fright to wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air and my throat swollen tight.The ventilation system is quite poor in this hotel, as is evidenced by the smell of cigarette smoke throughout the corridors. If you stay over a weekend, there is a large influx of weekend partiers who fill the hotel with cigarette smoke that easily passes from room to room. There are no smoke-free floors, and my smoke-free room had cigarette burns on the night table. If you are a non-smoker, I highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel. You should also be cautious if you stay for more than a few nights as you may (as I did on both occasions) leave with a nasty nasal infection.	
-	Aug 20 2006	Utilitarian	Functional business hotel in good location, if with late 80's decor. The staff however has all of the warmth of a post Soviet republic.	
-	Jun 22 2008 	Don't even try !!!	Can't agree more with all comments here regarding to this &quot;hotel&quot;. I'd say a motel or backpacked room is very much better. Everything is bad and definitely will greatly disappoint you, especially for those arrive in London with no other accommodation plan. The only good thing is you can walk down the street and you can get a 300% better place for a marginal extra. Don't even try it, everything is DISGUISTING!!!	
+	Oct 15 2009 	Perfect place to stay with a family	Stayed in a 3 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment with daughter, son-in-law and baby grandson. Building is old but the set-up suited us perfectly with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom able to be shut off from the rest of the apartment. The apartment was extremely clean and equipped with everything possible to make our stay easy and comfortable. Staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful but certainly not intrusive. Location was great - easy walk to Gloucester Road and Earls Court stations, supermarkets, banks, shops, pubs etc. We would certainly choose to stay there again if we have the opportunity.	
+	Dec 15 2007 	Clean comfy Comfort Inn.	This was the second time I stayed at the Comfort Inn Buckingham Palace, 8-12 St. George's Drive, London SW1V 4OU which is not even a 5 minutes walk from the Victoria Train Station (and the Underground) and less than 3 minutes from the Victoria Coach Station in the very heart of London with connections to both Gatwick and Heathrow airport.I highly recommend this clean and comfortable 3 star hotel which is extremely good value for money and for its great location, as nearly all the major sightseeing attractions are within walking distance. The staff is polite, friendly and helpful. You have a vast variety to choose from at breakfast and the room as well as the linen, is spotlessly clean too. The best thing is that this hotel has a hand-held power shower and not the usual horrid 'fixed' wall shower which nearly all other hotels have.After a busy day out shopping and sightseeing, I couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of this cosy and comfy hotel and relax.I will definitely stay there again.	
+	May 29 2004	Great Hotel!		
+	Sep 12 2008 	Clean convenient and comfortable	Excellent location, a few minutes walk from Victoria central coach station and Victoria tube station, this hotel will provide all the necessities with none of the frills at a reasonable price. My room was clean and neat, bed was comfortable, kettle and hairdryer were provided, continental breakfast was adequate and the service was friendly and efficient.	
+	Feb 20 2007	Great find	We had a two night stay in February. It was a few minutes walk from Lancaster Gate underground station and very easy to find, a great place to be. The hotel was inviting and we were welcomed and everything was very efficiently dealt with. We were on the ground floor, in G8, a lovely double room, but no view! Very clean, bright, with a comfortable bed, all amenities and good bathroom and powerful shower. Breakfast was down the steep stairs to the restaurant - just included continental, but fine on the first day, good juice and coffee - but no meats on the second day, we were towards the end of the breakfast period though! We also had a cream tea, which was pleasant. Good value for money. I am sure I will stay there again and would recommend it.	
+	Sep 22 2009 	Nice Hotel... Great Location!	My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 night as part of our tour of Europe... we arrived in London in the morning and there was no problem checking in a few hours early. Right down the street is all the shops and restaurants you could ask for. Plus a Tesco's if you want to grab some groceries and save some $$$. The internet was a joke, but they let us use their office PC to check in our flight and print our boarding passes, which was appreciated! We must have gotten one of the remodeled rooms as the room was fairly updated and clean.All in all it's a great hotel to stay at and everything can be accessed with ease... especially Kensington Gardens/Palace	
+	Oct 22 2008 	Pleasant Stay	The hotel is great, especially after reading the reviews of other hotels in London. I booked via lastminute a cut me a special offer. They sell it as a four stars and I can classify it as a good three stars. The staff is nice, the room clean and quite. It is positioned near the tube. The only remarks are about the room service, since the food is not that good and quite expensive. The breakfast is also expensive since you can find the rooms nearby the hotel with very great pies.	
+	Nov 1 2005	Great Location	The Copthorne is conveniently located close to small restaurants, shops and the Kensington station. Very easy to get around. The room was on the small side but certainly adequate and the bath was spotless. Eventhough we were on the 3rd floor, we had no problem getting a good night's rest. Internet access was available and the money exchange service located off their lobby was very convenient. It would get an &quot;Above Average&quot; score if is wasn't for the slow service or, in some cases, no service at all, in the restaurant at breakfast, which may have been due to the large tour group we were with. However, when we had dinner without the group, we were seated in very close proximity to a chain smoker (about 2 ft.). When we mentioned to the waitress that the smoke was making us very uncomfortable, there was no attempt to move our table eventhough there were only a few tables occupied in the large dining room. Since our dinner had already arrived, we ate quickly and left. We would stay there again, but hopefully, by that time, their &quot;no smoking&quot; law will be in effect.	
+	Apr 9 2004	People should stop complaining about this hotel	My husband and I recently booked a 4 night stay at the Copthorne Tara Kensington using Priceline. We paid $75 per night, plus tax.After reading the other reviews on Priceline, I was understandably concerned. However, after staying there I felt compelled to defend this hotel.We did not make any requests, other than to have a double bed. We stayed on a low floor, and I never heard the tube once.The room was modern, and the bed was very comfortable. The room was small in comparison to American hotels, but this we expected. The room was also very clean, and the staff helpful and pleasant. The only downside was the high price of the hotel restaurant for breakfast, which forced us to eat outside of the hotel for all of our meals. There were plenty of places to eat within walking distance so this was no real issue.To all of you that are complaining about this hotel, I urge you to get a grip on yourself. You are paying under $100 per night for a hotel in London. The only place cheaper is a youth hostel. If you get so bent out of shape about not having a wash cloth or other trivial issues that I saw posted, I urge you to stay within the pristine confines of your own home, and not venture out into the world. You will be perpetually disappointed. If you are expecting a hotel to be like the Ritz, you should cough up the extra money and pick a nicer hotel.To those of you looking to see the world, hit Priceline and grab the deal of the century. This place is a palace for that price. (Especially in a city as expensive as London, but that is a whole other review! :) )	
+	Dec 7 2003	Good location - good experience.	We stayed at the Tara from 11/27 - 12/01. We had an excellent stay and would stay there again. The rooms were booked directly on the Copthorne hotels site. We asked to have our 2 rooms located close together on the quiet side of the hotel away from the tube line as was suggested in a previous review. When we arrived after 11:00 PM our rooms were waiting for us on the quiet side of the building as we requested. The shower pressure was great. Another reviewer stated that the shower curtain didn't work. It works fine if you tuck it into the tub like you would at home. The beds were comfortable but small as are all twin beds in London. The rooms were clean and well upkept. The staff was pleasant and helpful when asked. Our rooms were made up each day without any problems. On talking to other guests at the hotel we got a very good rate booking directly with the hotel's website. I would recommend staying here due to an all around great experience.	
-	May 10 2009 	nightmare in the morning	JWe've just returned from a weekend at the Corus Hotel. We booked through Superbreak and got a good deal of £198 for the two of us bed and full english breakfast. After reading reviews of the small rooms with beds against the wall and confirming that with reception, we upgraded to executive room on arrival and on reaching our room were glad we did. The room was small in comparison to some of the B&amp;B's we have stayed in at less than half the price, but was clean and had everything we needed for our stay, with plenty of tea and coffee, butn not especially good quality. The bathroom was adequate and had plenty of soap etc that we didn't use. Our room was on the ninth floor overlooking Lancasther Gate. The room temperature was comfortable, the window's opened easily and there was airconditioning if needed. The bed was a normal double bed size and was very comfortable, there was plenty of extra bedding if needed. The hotel was full but in our room we hardly heard a sound. The reception and lounge areas were bright and well furnished and the reception staff were pleasant and professional but not especially warm. It was almost as if they were reading from a script and not showing any personality. We didn't hear an english accent among the staff all weekend. The main problem with the Corus Hotel is the organisation at breakfast. There isn't enough room in the restaurant and each morning we had to wait in reception until we were called. Once in the restaurant we had to wait to be seated. Staff were running around clearing tables and trying to stock up food but lacked organisation. The breakfast is self service and food was frequently running out, and we were having to wait for food to be re-stocked. Rather than a relaxing start to the day, we felt rushed and left breakfast feeling stressed and jaded. All in all the Corus is a clean comfortable hotel in a good position right by Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate Station and only a short stroll to Paddington Station, but it isn't good value for money and we struggle to understand how it has a 4 star rating.	
-	Jan 24 2009 	Used to be better	I've written good reviews about the Corus in the past and had found it to be clean, comfortable and with good service. After a break from traveling for work I returned and actually was rather disappointed to find the Corus has downgraded in a few small ways which add up to a mediocre stay. I shan't be asking to stay here again.	
+	Oct 16 2008 	Convenient Location Nice Accomodations	We stayed at Corus Hyde Park for three nights from September 30, 2008 through October 3, 2008 on a trip to London to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We booked with British Airways Holidays and got the room for a bargain of $426 total for three nights ($142 per night).The lobby was nice, using mirrored walls to make it seem spacious. It featured modern furnishing and two computers with internet access (I think we paid a pound for 15 minutes).The hotel is very convenient to the Lancaster Gate tube station and only a 10 minute walk to Paddington. When leaving the Lancaster Gate Tube station, turn right, cross the street, then take your first right, after &quot;The Swan&quot; pub. &lt; 5 min walk.The first day we arrived we wandered through Hyde Park and found we were also only a 15 minute walk to Knightsbridge.The hotel rooms were small, as expected in London, with modern, simplistic furnishing. It appeared to have been renovated within the past 5 years. Our room was on the 6th floor and had a view of the back alleyway. There was some noise at night, garbage bins in the back alley, but that is expected in the city. We had everything we need, including a flat screen TV and a shower with great water pressure. We also had tea and tasty ginger biscuits in our room. Our rate included breakfast daily. It was a nice spread, including juice, coffee, tea, cereal, croissants, rolls, cheese, deli meat, granola, yogurt, etc...We had drinks at the bar one night and the bartender was pleasant and accommodated our strange American mixed drink requests.I would stay here again. Not the nicest hotel in London, but a good bargain, nicer than I expected.	
-	Oct 7 2008 	Uncomfortable 	I booked this hotel based on location and price. The single room I was allocated looked out onto the well of the building and the star feature was a sheet of wire netting covered in bird poo. Asked to move and was given a twin room. Very small &amp; if there were two people in the room they would have been tripping over each other. On a positve note the room was made up each day in an identical way, the bathroom had ample soap &amp; shower gel, and the TV was excellent (new large plasma that contrary to the website I did not have to pay extra to use). The staff were all very friendly. The bedding, like many cheaper hotels, left a lot to be desired. The blankets, pillows, and in particular the bed cover have the fug (&quot;old man smell&quot;) of the last 1000 people that have stayed in the room. The window blind was broken and only had one position - down - so I needed to have the light on at all time. The hallway on the 1st floor is used as storage for vacumn cleaners and bags of bedding - as this is the fire escape it does represent a hazard if there were an emergency evacuation. If I had paid more than the £69 per night that I did I would have stamped my feet and screamed. I'm still itching from the thought of that smelly bedding.	
+	Nov 7 2005	My 11 yr old wants to go back asap	We stayed here in early - mid Sep for 5 nights. My daughter and husband made great use of the upstairs lounge area and honesty bar while I shoppped. In fact my 11 yr old daughter is very keen to get back to London asap, but has specified that a stay in this hotel is a must. I am not sure whether its London and the Krispy Kreme donuts at Harrods or the Covent Garden hot chocs she liked, but she had a great time. Be sure to visit Rules, Londons oldest restaurant within easy walking distance.	
+	Nov 25 2002	Great hotel		
+	Jul 24 2006 	Cranley is convenient and has character	My wife and I stayed four 5 nights in one of The Cranley's four-poster rooms (607 - ground floor) which looked out onto the street. The room was very comfortable and certainly spacious enough and the big four-poster was very nice to sleep on (plenty of extra pillows). Bathroom a little small but ok with a heated towel rail. It had enough wardrobe and drawer space and a nice big flat screen TV / Cd / DVD opposite the bed (not that we watched much on it). A nice breakfast table with 3 chairs (there was an armchair as well). The room safe worked by swiping any magnetic striped card (e.g credit card) which was a lot easier than remembering a code.Overall we found the hotel had the old-England charm and the personal service that we were looking for. They have the room keys on huge brass weights which you wouldn't want to carry around - the idea is you hand it to them when you go out. The doors lock from the outside by the old-fashioned method!The staff were friendly enough and professional and while it was convenient to have a continental breakfast (i.e. no hot food) delivered to the room you might do better to make the short stroll to Gloucester Road (near the tube) where you could get a nice cooked brekky for half the price. We only used the room service menu once and the club sandwiches were excellent.There are plenty of restaurant options nearby (easy flat walking) as well as a small convenience store 4 doors down and an ATM opposite the tube station.We never made it for the afternoon tea and scones but were regulars for the champagne in the evenings (a generous glass but they could do with more canapes ...). If they recommend the Indian restaurant two doors down give it a miss - it was over-priced, small portions and very ordinary take-away quality. We found a nice Spanish tapas bar further up Gloucester Road.The location is good - it lives up to it's claim of being in a quiet side street (which is not easy to find in a big, busy city like London) and it is an easy, flat walk to Gloucester Road tube station (which can take you straight into the city or directly out to Kew Gardens). One unexpected bonus for anyone touring London for the first time is that both of the most popular open-top bus companies (Big Bus; The Original) have stops at Gloucester Road tube so it is so easy to hop on and off right where you are staying.	
+	Feb 12 2006	charming and comfortable	I spent 5 days at the Cranley together with my wife and our 16-year old daughter - and we'll certainly choose this hotel again for our next trip to London. The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms well decorated and the bathroom the best we ever had in a London city hotel. Bina Gardens is a quiet small road in Kensington, 5 minutes to the next tube station. The breakfast is brought by the room service, there is no breakfast room in the hotel. Afternoon tea at 4 p.m. and a glass of champagne at 7 p.m. are served in the (small) lobby, thus giving your stay another personal touch.	
+	Aug 21 2006	Good on a budget	My partner and I stayed at the Crestfield from the 2nd July 2006 - 5th July 2006.Good Points:GREAT location. Only a Short walk to the tube. Lots of places to eat, a post office and a few pubs nearby. CHEAP.The tiny bar and courtyard at the back was quite nice on a summer evening.A complimentary breakfast (quite basic- cereal, toast, juice, coffee)Good-sized rooms.Bad Points:NO Air conditioning. If I was going to stay in London again in summer, i would stay in a place with air conditioning. It was very hot in the rooms, even with the window open at night.NO lift. We were a few floors up, and had to lug all our luggage up the stairs. Overall, a good, cheap stay. Clean and basic, a bit old and worn. Not ideal for the London Heat Waves, though!	
+	Jun 14 2006	Very Good Choice	I found the Crestfield quite easily. It was exactly where the directions said it would be - across the street from Kings Cross Station. The gentleman that checked me in was very friendly. The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day. And the front door is locked at all times. You have to buzz to get in. When you leave, you have to leave your room key and collect it when you return. My room was on the third floor. As it is an older building, it had no elevators, so I had to walk up and down a LOT of steps. I had both of my knees fixed, so it was a work out for me. If you are an older person or have bad knees, this may not be the hotel for you. My room was quite clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable. I had booked an en suite and it was clean and had plenty of hot water for showers. As a warning to the Americans - the ensuite room has the toilet, sink and shower all in one room. It is small, but like I said, it was clean and I had plenty of hot water for showering. The booking came with a continental breakfast: three types of cereal, toast, orange juice, apple juice, coffee and tea. It was basic, but quite filling. They come round to refresh your coffee or tea often. If you are on a budget, I highly recommend this hotel.	
+	Aug 19 2009 	Cricklewood hotel	Arrived at London City Airport from Russia via Copenhagen, so picked up rental car and drove to this hotel as it was convenient for our first visit the next morning. Lovely Hotel, I enjoyed the mix of old and new architecture. staff were pleasant and helpful, our room very comfortable . We had dinner in the restaurent which was a bit overpriced and not as great as we expected. Breakfast was good. The bar we used was large and empty we probably should have used another but too tired to explore.Pool looked so inviting shame we ran out of time.Found the location convenient and would consider using again for next visit to London as the transport links were good and one avoids the congestion charge.Parking was free as we dined at the hotel	
+	Aug 30 2005	Wonderful	I share in the praise of this wonderful hotel. Although it's a fifteen minute Tube ride from the sight seeing attractions, it was an ideal location for us. We work in New York City, and London is similar in many ways.In addition to all the good things said by other reviewers, I would like to say that the pool and sauna were fantastic. We had a lovely departure meal, with live music, in the hotel restaurant, and I can only say good things about the staff. One feature which I thought was cute, but very efficient, was notice of a telephone call on the TV screen in the room. Also, Fabiano, the concierge, was extremely helpful.The Crown Moran was terrific! We'd love to stay there again.	
+	Apr 27 2007 	Good value friendly 	My husband &amp; I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on the London Marathon weekend. We booked on a bed &amp; breakfast plus dinner on the first night deal for £129.00 total. We were given a choice of dining on either night, but we already had plans for our second night.The staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive throughout.Our room was of a reasonable size, very clean, and had adequate storage space. All the furnishings were modern and in good repair &amp; the bed very comfortable. A hairdrier, room safe, trouser press and basic toiletries were provided.Breakfast was full English, but nothing to make it special. Dinner was Table d'hote with 4 choices at each of the 3 courses, pleasant enough, but the service was a bit slow, especially as we were the only people in the restaurant. At breakfast it was much quicker, despite most of the tables being filled. Drinks were twice the price of the average bar.The hotel was very close to the underground station (district line), handy for a quick trip into Central London.All-in-all a good stay.	
+	Mar 6 2007 	Just lovely	I've stayed in the St. Gregory a few times now, and it's just lovely. The rooms are spacious, airy with excellent air conditioning and comfy beds. The staff are polite, friendly and helpful. The restaraunt on the roof it top class: buffet breakfast with views over the square mile and, what's that i hear in the background? Yep Jazz. The only downside is the location. If you're a tourist the attractions are by no means in walking distance. Liverpool St. Underground is a 10 -15 min walk south, and Old Street is a 10 min walk north. If you're on business, the City is in easy walking distance and you can walk from the St Gregory to London bridge in around 20-25 mins.	
+	Jun 24 2009 	A nice hotel in a convenient location - would stay there again.	I stayed here for 8 nights in June 2009. Unlike some other reviewers my room was not tired at all. It was updated and very clean. The carpet was new, tiles in the bathroom were new and everything had been updated. I was traveling by myself and had a double bed - room 559. It was very quiet and I never heard anyone in another room. The view was only of office buildings - but I only used the room to sleep in so it didn't matter to me. The room was also very large for London - the biggest I've ever had. The TV had a lot of channels, there were 2 robes in the room, a pot for making coffee and tea and an ice bucket with a bottle of carbonated and still water - which they replenished each day as a courtesy if I drank them. There is also an ice maker on every floor which comes in very handy. And it had air conditioning that actually worked (rare for London).The room had a hairdryer on the wall in the bathroom without enough pressure for my hair, but it also had a hairdryer in the drawer of the dresser and there was a plug by the mirror and it was more powerful than the other. The water pressure was poor, but there was plenty of hot water and the bathroom was nice and large and clean - it even had a lighted makeup mirror on the wall. They provide soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, q-tips and a shower cap. There was also a full length mirror in the room, iron, ironing board, trouser press and safe.The Internet as others have said is ridiculous - 7lbs for 15min, 12lbs for 30mins or 15lbs for 24hrs. There is a pub nearby with free wifi, but I never used it - taking my laptop was a waste - I just used the Blackberry.It's located between St. James and Victoria Tube stations - a short walk from each. It's about a 15 min walk to get to Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Circus. You can go in front of Buckingham Palace and turn right on the Mall - but I preferred to turn right on Birdcage and go through St. James Park. West End shows are 20-30mins walk. Harrods is about 30 mins. Breakfast which was included in my rate was very good. They had lots of traditional English things like baked beans and mushrooms. They also had scrambled eggs everyday (you could ask for eggs cooked another way), rolls, chocolate croissants, fruits, meats, cereal, apple juice and orange juice. For lunch the Broadway Cafe offers good sandwiches at very reasonable prices. There is also a convenience store right by the hotel where I got some snacks. Most of the area was closed when I got back after 9:00. The staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful. I arrived at 7am, check-in wasn't until 2:00, but they got me a room by 8:30am. I would absolutely stay there again and recommend to others - at least if you get room 559!	
+	Jan 7 2007 	not a bad pick	We stayed several times at this hotel, this time over New Year and found it quite pleasant. The room this time was nicely furnished, newer than the last ones, and had a spacious bathroom with window. The reception could be more efficient, since they had erroneously extended our stay by 6 days although we had booked it through a travel's agent last October. This resulted in a long wait until they had found us a new room with the correct dates. Breakfast is rather plain, the choice is limited and the quality pretty mediocre. There are no diet offers and the tea out of a thermos pitiful when one thinks of England as a tea drinking nation. The worst, however, was that they had put a credit guarantee of over 2,000 suisse francs on our credit card and forgot to cancel the amount when checking out, although everything had been pre-paid. This left us with an unusable credit card for the remaining days in London. As I said, better trained staff can be expected from a famous hotel chain. In comparison to other London hotels, however, not a bad pick.	
+	Feb 27 2009 	Reasonable 	Reception &amp; checkout very friendly &amp; efficient. Concierge knowledgeable &amp; very friendly.Stayed 2 nights in king size club room. Room OK but number of cosmetic problems that did no justice to the premium rate charged e.g eye catching scratches on table in dining area (strange because the table surface had a glass top protective cover) and some furniture surfaces looking tired and dull. If you think the inclusive continental breakfast in the club lounge an attraction..think again. On the weekend we were there it conisted of two croissants and half a dozen mini danish pastries....that's it ! apart from automated machine serving beverages. Two other couples walked in while we were there, saw the display &amp; walked out again in disgust. The evening was bettter with a good choice of beer, wine, spirits &amp; canapesThese little disappointments apart, the hotel is well located near tubes and attractions, clean and tidy and worth the money provided you get a good deal.	
+	Nov 25 2008 	Liked the room the location and the price.	Stayed here for two nights in a club junior suite earlier this year. The room was very nice and the staffs were friendly and accommodating. There was a problem with service in the club lounge on Sunday evening. But my complaint was handled very professional and friendly. I was invited to talk to the guest relations manager and she asked if she could do anything for us. My request for a late check out was honoured immediately. Not always so simple on a week day. Best of all, that evening service at the lounge was impeccable.I like a hotel where I feel they take customer suggestions seriously and really try and improve wherever possible.Although there isnt much going on right around the hotel, it is sort of in the middle of all the major attractions. So you can get everywhere easily using public transport.Breakfast was good, but very English. Not necessarily everyones cup of tea, but I liked it.All in all, a very nice stay.	
-	Nov 11 2008	Not up to crown plaza standards	I feel i got too llttle for what i expected. Cheaply done, with lotsof trainees as employees everywhere and little other service. Not recommended	
+	Dec 30 2007 	Fine place	After I booked this hotel, negative reviews appeared regarding the hotel, so I was a bit apprehensive of staying there. My experience was great. We had reserved a studio but were given a 1 BR, and when I said it was a bit cold, they immediately sent up a space heater and that was that. We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. The hotel is in a great location for underground travel to/from Heathrow and for tourism in London.	
+	Mar 20 2006	Curzon Plaza so convenient	Though the apartments are rather spare, and the kitchen tiny, the location can't be beat. It's in Mayfair, 1 1/2 blocks from the Green park tube stop and a five minute walk to Buckingham Palace. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom, 2 bath. I would guess this apt. had at least 1000 sq. feet. Be forewarned though, Curzon appears to be a shortcut between Park Lane and Piccadilly, so the cabs are buzzing round at all hours. Even on the 6th floor, we had a lot of street noise. The hotel itself though is very quiet, has wireless internet, laundry service, and a 24 hour desk staff.	
+	Jan 8 2009 	Liked it a lot	Booked through Laterooms at £75 for an executive room, I enjoyed my stay here - free parking, modern room, Sky Sports 1, 2 &amp; 3, plus they let you take your dog, this is one for the revisit list.Friendly reception and in-house restaurant, you can't go wrong.You do really need a car if you want to go into London.Pillows are poor and the heating system very noisy, but otherwise I left happy.	
+	Jul 31 2006	Check Booking with Hotel	Stayed here while attending a local party. Hotel is (in my opinion) 1 above a Travelodge but I did an internet booking choosing a &quot;Business&quot; room over a normal one as it offerred an iron and ironing board and a fridge (I loathe that UHT stuff so always bring a pint of milk). After checking in I realised that there was no fridge or ironing stuff. Reception told me that fridges were only supplied to Suites or long stay guests but they could bring the iron etc to my room (which they did very quickly). The air-con did not work but they had supplied a free standing fan. It seems that Days Inns are independently owned - this was fine for a one night stay, nice and clean with a good size bath but the room was tiny. But if you want something in particular that is on the web booking - phone the actual hotel to see if it really is available.	
+	Mar 19 2007 	Good Value - Great Location!!	Fab location 10-15 minute walk from Victoria underground station, from the room I had on the top floor you can see most major attractions, from my bathroom window I could see Big Ben. The room was OK size wise but was very very clean and smelt fresh. All in all very good value for money would definitely stay again.	
-	Mar 20 2009 	Terrible	Nothing more to say other than it's one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed with. Not very clean, terrible decor, and very run down. Staff are not very friendly, and weren't willing to sort out errors. The only good thing is the location!	
+	Aug 2 2009 	Excellent Value. Nice Place	Got a deal off lastminute.com for £240 for 3 nights with breakfast. Hotel and room were both smart and comfortable and staff were very helpful. Breakfast was also very enjoyable (you can think of it, it was there). Ample parking on site and only 10mins from tube station into London.	
+	Apr 1 2008 	Good value	A good quality hotel (no aircon) with easy access to central London (£89 for a double with B&amp;B) and next door to the National Maratime Museum. Room sizes good for a London hotel &amp; clean with a good bathroom. Breakfast buffet good providing you avoid peak times which are posted in the lifts. We did not dine as the menu was rather short &amp; uninteresting but there are lots of good restaurants within a short walk of the hotel. A good choice for visiting London without the hassle of a city centre hotel which invariably charge high prices and are poor value. Could get hot in the summer as there appears to be no aircon and the fire doors were illegally jammed open. Staff generally friendly.	
+	Sep 14 2007 	Excellent location friendly staff and value for money	We stayed here in April 2007 on a quick visit to London to see a show. We stayed in Greenwich as we also wanted to visit the Maritime Museum and Royal Observatory. The Devonport Hotel was a lovely place to spend the night. It has a fabulous location in the centre of Greenwich right next door to the park. It has excellent parking and extremely friendly and helpful staff. The rooms aren't huge but are well appointed and comfortable. Clean and airy with a good bathroom. Our room also had a pleasant view. Breakfast was plentiful and good. It was easy to get to the West End by simply catching the river taxi. It was a wonderful way to spend a Saturday night and we are trying to find an excuse to revisit Devonport House again soon.	
+	Oct 2 2009 	Positivamente impressionato		
+	Oct 4 2005	Great Hotel	We arrived at the Draycott after being dissatisfied with the hotel we planned to stay at and were treated so well by the staff there I was sorry I didn't book this hotel originally! We stayed in &quot;Grenfell&quot; (rooms have names not numbers) which is a deluxe double overlooking the gardens. The room looks like the photo on the hotel's web site (although the furniture is in need of replacement as the couch was saggy). The hotel is very quiet and well managed and charming. The hotel is very close to Sloane Square and is in a very nice neighborhood. The breakfast that comes with breakfast packages is more food than you could ever eat and the staff is great. On my next trip to London I will not even look for another hotel and will simply book the Draycott. Its a great great hotel.	
-	Jun 13 2006 	Average Hotel tiny room too hot in Summer	This hotel is one of many that typically stretch along these streets in the Paddington area. The positive things are a great bathroom and shower, and otherwise modern furniture. It's also pretty clean. The negative things are tiny rooms and no A/C. The room size was just enough to contain the bed and a wall-closet-desk-combination (it was difficult to find space to place my luggage!). The heat (June) is so annoying that sleep is diffucult, and leaving the window open on the ground floor might not be safe. The distance to the next subway might be an issue for some travellers, though the proximity of Hyde Park is good. There is wifi (fee) from another hotel near by.	
+	Aug 25 2008	Very Classic British	This hotel is great., in the St James area of London. Our two bedroom suite was gorgeous. Much better than likes of the Ritz, Savoy or Dorchester. The only other hotels that come close to this are the Lanesborough, Claridge's and the Connaught. The restaurant is ok, kind of cold but the drawing room is great for tea. The staff are top knotch though!	
+	May 15 2008 	Dukes is a wonderful hotel!	My four sisters, my Mom and I stayed at Dukes for 2 nights at the beginning of May. We had 3 wonderful rooms. The only thing I would suggest is to put some electrical outlets in the bathrooms. We had to do the blow dry curling iron thing in the bedroom part.The service was excellent! Before arrival they arranged airport pick up for us, two dinner reservations, and breakfast reservations at the hotel. They also got us tickets for the Tower of London, the Big Bus, and St. Paul's. All the staff were very friendly and alway smiling. We like that.We ended up not having time for breakfast the second morning but our breakfast the first morning was really, really good. I had the eggs benedict!I would definitely stay here again and I would definitely recommend it.	
+	Jun 10 2005	A wonderful time in a special place		
+	Sep 13 2007 	Does what it says on the tin.	On deciding to take a trip to London with my Boyfriend this Autumn, we found the most difficult thing to be finding somewhere to stay. Although this may seem virtually impossible in London, it seemed as though there was a big gap in the market between youth hostel and full blown hotel - not to mention the price. We stumbled on the EasyHotel website whilst looking on the internet for B&amp;B's which seemed to be in our price range, and at £40 a night for three nights in September (and bear in mind we only booked a month in advance), the deal seemed unbeatable. After reading a lot of negative reviews, I could only, and still can, discern that people's adverse feelings towards the hotel was because they did not fully research the hotel on the EasyHotel website, and didn't know what they were getting themselves in for. And in my opinion, serves them right going into it blindly!In all honesty, yes it was small, and yes, if one of us was standing up in the room, the other had to either be in the bathroom or on the bed, but for the time that we spent actually in the room itself, i.e. sleeping and washing, it served the purpose perfectly!Both the bathroom and the bed were immaculately clean, the bathroom was functional and did have &quot;holes in the wall&quot; so to speak to store shower gel, etc, as well as a bin, a rail on the back of the door (great for hanging one of those washbags with the hooks which was the most practical way of saving space in the bathroom) and a soap dispenser on the wall. The shower was hot and consistent (hot water was always available) and yes, if you leave the door open there is a CHANCE you'd get the floor of the room wet, but they do provide you with a shower mat to put on the floor. Similarly, the bed was standard double bed sized, not cramped at all, and the duvet was warm and the pillows and mattress comfortable. One factor that must be taken into consideration is that you cannot unpack. There are two hooks provided for hanging up coats, and because we booked a window (invaluable - definitely spend that little bit extra), the window ledge, as well as under the bed, but apart from that you WILL have to live out of a suitcase - this SHOULDN'T be a problem if you are tidy (there honestly isn't enough floor space to be messy) and if you are only staying a few days. We stayed three nights and travelled light, knowing what we were going to wear on each day. Granted, not everyone wants to be this organised or pared down, but if you can it does help.There are only two limitations I can think of, one would be that the hotel doesnt have any kind of restaurant attatched, and we found getting breakfast a little difficult - although there is a MASSIVE 24 hour tesco just along the road which has a Costa coffee shop with delicious muffins! The other is that the window doesnt open and that can feel a little claustophobic. The room is air conditioned which isnt obtrusive (its not too loud or the jet too high powered) but we did find it hot during the middle of the night. Other than that, there's little else I feel people can pick at - the hotel literally 'does what it says on the tin'. It's a base to sleep and that's about it. If you're the type of traveller who likes to spend time hanging about the hotel then this definitely isnt for you, but if, like us, you'd rather spend your time (and the money you saved) in the pubs and restaurants on Earls court road and London in general, then it really cant be beaten on price and practically.It's ideally situated, close to the tube and anything amenities you could need (the aforementioned tescos, sainsburys local, somerfield, as well as a laundrette, and loads of pubs, general shops and restaurants) and the staff are pleasant and I will no doubt be going back soon!	
+	Jun 15 2009 	Does what it says on the tin	We weren't sure about booking an easyhotel but will happily do so in future. The prices are attractive since most of the time we're just looking for somewhere to sleep in London, and that usually costs a ridiculous sum of money. With the bedroom menu that they offer, you know what you're getting. And contrary to my worst fears, the hotel wasn't in some horrible slum; it was in a great location and was clean and tidy throughout. The staff were efficient and helpful (but not five-star luxury smiley, which was fine by us). We had a standard room with no window - absolutely fine, imagine small rooms are not much more than a bed surrounded by four walls. Bed was fine (pillows could have been better), bathroom was one of those pods much like you get in an Ibis, pretty tight but functioned and was really clean, and to my surprise had shampoo and shower gel dispensers. There was no furniture other than the bed, so if you're staying more than one or two nights be prepared to live out of your suitcase. The floor was lino like you get in schools and hospitals - not cosy, but at least clean, and preferable to manky carpet. I could have forgiven them if they hadn't branded the room by painting one wall bright orange, but that's to be expected I suppose. Overall, a decent place to lay your head and grab a shower in the morning, saving some pennies for the train journey and a nice breakfast en route. Wouldn't hesitate to use again, and have booked their Kensington hotel for a few weeks' time.	
+	Dec 4 2008 	would stay again	I booked directly with easyhotel as they don't come up on searches. I was only wanting a crash pad and to be honest for the price (£53) i wasn't expecting much. Was happily surprised when i got there, the reception staff were friendly and polite and the room was better than i expected. It was clean, warm and bigger than i thought it was going to be! The bathroom was compact but enough room to do what you need + the shower was hot. Word of advice, when ur not using the toilet, keep the lid down as if u drop what your using - it'll fall in!My boyfriend usually stays in more expensive places, but he thought that this was perfect for a one night stay.Will book again.	
+	Jul 23 2009 	Tiny room but very practical and great value	If all you want to do in London is crash on a bed, take a quick shower and enjoy the city, this is the best place. I've stayed in B&amp;Bs in London before and most of them are old looking and quite tacky but quite expensive. Easy Hotel is simple, no beating by the bush: a double bed and a bathroom, that's all you need! Everything was very clean though they didn't clean our room during our stay. The location is very good, 2minutes walk to tube station, 5 min to Hyde Park, reachable by night bus. The main asset of this hotel is its price, £50 per night for 2 people.	
+	May 13 2006	A Great Place to Stay	Just returned from a week in London and stayed at the Ebury House. This is a nice, budget B&amp;B in a fantastic area of London and on a residential street, so it's fairly quiet at night. We stayed in two different rooms: the first was a twin (2 twins) and the second a double. Both rooms were very small by American standards and the bathrooms were hysterically tiny! (We looked into another room on the second floor that overlooked the back garden, and it was larger as was its bathroom.) But we knew all this before we went and were not surprised. Also, we didn't visit London to sit in our room! We found the beds to be comfortable enough. The breakfast is decidedly NOT gourmet, but it is satisfying: warm and filling. The tea was wonderful. The management is very friendly and helpful. We received a really warm welcome. They try very hard to make everyone's stay as nice as possible. We stayed for seven nights and paid 60 pounds a night, a fabulous price for London! Please remember that this is a small, budget hotel. For the price, it is an exceptional value: decent breakfast, ensuite bathrooms (in some rooms), marvelous location in a quiet area, clean towels and bed made each morning, and a caring and friendly staff. What more could you ask? Overall, we were really pleased and would most definitely stay there again.	
-	Jul 4 2005	Never Never book this hotel	Having checked into this hotel on the evening of Live8 and paid in full - we came back to find that the Eden Hotel given away our room and we were told to leave.	
-	Oct 11 2004	Hostel masquerading as a hotel		
+	Jan 28 2009 	Lovely stu	On one hand, It was a great hotel, well situated, tube station very close which make thing really easy.On the other hand it was very clean and the stuff was kind and friendly.In conclusion, it was much better than i thought and a really good place to stay for an economic price.	
+	Jun 15 2006	Relieved - thought it was a great value	I was very worried about the hotel after reading the reviews and tried to change hotels but was having a hard time meeting all our requirements anywhere else. So my husband and I were pleasantly surprised when the rooms were fine: decent size for Europe, cleaned daily, and serviceable. At $80 (including taxes but excluding breakfast ) through expedia, this was a *great* deal for London. (I don't think I'd pay more than $120 for a double, though.) Most of the staff was very friendly, and the night guy, who could be a bit grumpy, was fine with a little patience.BTW, the continental breakfast at 5 pounds was fine, but we liked Luigi's down the street on Spring Street--you could get a decent-sized breakfast for 3.5 pounds or less.	
-	Jan 2 2005	Gouge your eyes out with a fork before you stay here	Whoever said this hotel is clean was drinking waaay too much mead at the pub and bashed their head on the toilet. It is nasty and that's being generous. The carpet in our room was filthy and coming apart from the wall. The room radiator didn't work and there was no heat in the bathroom--in December! Hotel staff is discourteous and uncaring. We waited for mail and phone messages that were never given to us! The only compliment I can give this hotel is that the wake-up call actually worked on the morning I left. I can't say it enough--Stay away from this establishment.	
-	Apr 24 2004	Look elseswhere	Dirty, horrible room that shook each time one of the regular trains went past. Empty food containers behind the bedside cabinet, TV did not work, reception unable to sort it out. Toast was greatly prepared by the experienced chef as described in their web page!!Please please look elsewhere, there are plenty of good budget hotels in the area-this is not one of them.	
+	Oct 26 2006 	Edward Lear is a bargain!	I have just returned from London, staying five nights at the Edward Lear Hotel. I was looking for a bargain, and this hotel is that. My single room (no bathroom) was very small, almost a broom closet, but I knew that going in. The room was clean; the breakfast each morning absolutely delicious, and the guests interesting and fun to talk to. Many are return customers, liking the bargain and the history attached to the hotel. I was on the second floor, so be mindful that there is no elevator! The bathroom was kept clean, and yes, I did have to wait a few times. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially when trying to figure out how to make a phone call. I would stay here again; London is an expensive city, and you can't beat the price!!!	
+	Feb 12 2006	Value for Money	We stayed at the Hotel in January, 2006 on our weekend shopping in London. The hotel was old but quite cute. Great for travellers with a low budget for Hotels and those who do not wish to spend long periods in their room. The rooms are quite small, witht thin walls. There is everything you need to have a shower and sleep, even though you will have to step out of the shower soaked with water in the middle of the room. The breakfast was great with variety of food. One of the only problems with this hotel was that it didn't have a lift and it was fairly frustrating to go up 4 storeys with heavy shopping bags. We will definetly return, but with our room being maximum on the 2nd floor. Afterall you get value for money, cheap hotel close to oxford street.	
+	Sep 19 2007 	Unbelievable Service	I have traveled the world and been (thanks to my various employers) to many great 5 star hotels in London, NY, Boston, Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong etc.This is the first time that I have been blown away by the service at a hotel.Dropped off my luggage in the morning and when I got back at lunch to check into my room, they had already hung up all my suits.Reception staff welcomed me by name each time I walked in. The room is immaculate and includes free wifi, a Bose iPod docking station for my iPod, LCd TV in room and bathroom. and loads more.But again service, service, service.The bar in the Hotel.....great and discrete with Antonio making an unbelievable Martini and at 60 he has stories about De Niro, Oliver Reed and many more from his 44 year career as a barman in all the top hotels in London.$	
-	Jan 22 2004	Not up to advertisment.		
-	Oct 24 2009 	Be warned!	We arrived on the monday afternoon. We walked into the hotel reception and saw a wonderful and modern marble reception which is exactly what we expected from the online photo's we had looked at before booking at this hotel. This is where the comparison ended! The receptionist ignored us for 5 minutes before finally welcoming us (if you can call it a welcome) to the hotel. I signed us in and we were told the room number and where the lift was. We worked out for ourselves which floor we were on and found our room (109). We walked into the room and rather than the flat screen, wall mounted TV and all the mod cons that were advertised online, we found what apeared to be a single room with 2 single beds pushed together in a room which was well overdue for updating with an old portable TV on a wall mounted stand which, if not carefull, you'd knock your head on getting out of bed. All the basics were provided (Tea/ Coffe facilities) and the room was clean, but there was a lack of the style that we were expecting. The room was so small that there wasn't enough room for both of us to walk around the bed at the same time. The en-suite shower room was small and had mix and match fittings (mostly mix!). The view out of our bedroom window consisted of 3 cables tied together with string and the contents of a used cigarette counter (including lighters and matches). On a positive, the hotel was only 2 minutes walk from the tube station which got us far away from the hotel in record time. All in all, I'd not recommend this hotel to anybody and would advise anybody that does book into this hotel to check the room number and facilities before confirming the booking.	
-	Nov 9 2009 	Expected more	Booked the hotel trough hotwire, which means you dont know in advance which htl exactly you book. public areas are quite ok. rooms are very poor. terrible lighting, cold, tiny, did not really feel clean. Definately a very basic 3 star if not 2 star.	
+	Sep 13 2009 	smart and small	The room was small, but clean, minimalist, and nice. The bathroom was good, bed was comfy, and there was a good buffet breakfast.	
-	Oct 18 2005	Stay was ok overall inspite of the problems	We have just returned from a 6-night stay at Exhibition Court Hotel 4. The staff were quite friendly at check-in. We arrived a bit early, about 9:30 a.m., after travelling overnight on a trans-atlantic flight. We were happy that they allowed us to go into the room then since check-in time was 13:00 hours. We experienced some problems with the room though. The water was not running out of the face basin, the water was not running out of the shower, when we opened the pipe to get a shower, the shower head immediately fell off as water started to come out of it, almost falling onto my foot, then the fridge had a real moldy smell, the toilet seat cover came off at one end. Was a bit disappointed at first, since they knew we were coming and the room was not really in a ready state for guest. We reported the problems, the guy came and used a plunger in the shower area and that helped, the face basin problem did not get fixed neither the shower head problem, so the following day they offered us another room. That room had a problem with the kitchenette sink, couldnt get any water from the pipe. I immediately asked the guy at the desk to come and look at it, he said he would, but he forgot. We went out, I reminded him as we were leaving, but hours later nothing had been done about it. The next day, I reminded them and they came and turned the water on from underneath the sink, only to return an hour later to say that water was leaking into another room below us so it had to be turned off. They said the plumber would be in the next day. He didnt come until early evening after having to go back to them again. Anyway the problem finally got resolved. Overall apart from the problems, my stay turned out to be ok. The hotel is at a good location. Its just that I would expect them if they are expecting guests to have the rooms in a ready condition. For example, I am sure the last guest who stayed in the room, reported problems with the room both the shower head falling off and plumbing problems in the shower and face basin area and the lack of water in the kitchenette, in fact I believe that is why the water was turned off from underneath the sink, because of the problem. I find the staff from one shift to the next do not communicate your problems effectively to the other person who is taking over. I didnt find the breakfast appealing, went down the first day and didnt bother after that. Also for persons wanting to do any sort of cooking in the room, I thought they could include things like a sharp knife to cut things, a little dishwashing liquid, a kitchen towel or paper towels, just little things that would help.	
+	Feb 15 2008 	Fabulous stay at the Falcon	I recently spent a weekend at the Falcon. As I am a student and was travelling alone, I was interested in the single semi-ensuite to save money because the price of 39 pounds was unbeatable. After contacting the hotel I was told that a single semi-ensuite was only available for one night and I could have a double semi-ensuite for the second night at a price of 47 pounds per night for my stay. As I was used to paying 65 pounds per night I found this to be very reasonable, especially based on the positive reviews found here on trip advisor. The room sizes may be small for those used to North American room sizes but for a budget, central London hotel/B&amp;B I found the room and shower sizes to be just fine. Both rooms I was in had a small balcony overlooking the square which was a nice touch. The first room I had (the single) must have had a smoker staying the night before because there was a strong smell of smoke but the windows were open to air out the room when I arrived and that was appreciated. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and I have no complaints. The only thing I would suggest is that a light be installed near the shower because once the curtain was closed it was a bit dark, but was manageable. The double room was a bit bigger and had a large flat screen tv opposite the bed (but no remote control) and was also very clean and comfortable. There was a light installed outside the shower in this room so maybe it's just the budget rooms that don't have the shower light.I found the hotel staff to be very friendly and eager to help when called upon. It was a bit strange to have the toilet not only outside the room but two flights of stairs down when I had the single room, but for the price and the fact that I was only at the hotel in the morning and at night, it was no problem. Another nice touch that I appreciated was the water dispenser near reception, as it was a good way to hydrate myself before making the trek up the stairs to my room!For the past 3-4 years I have stayed in the Sussex Gardens/Norfolk Square area at various hotels because I liked the location (very close to Paddington Station and as a female I don't like to have to walk far from the station to the hotel at night) but haven't found a hotel I was completely satisfied with. I can stop searching now because the Falcon hotel is where I will be staying from now on.	
+	Jul 1 2007 	a gem of a hotel	we stayed in the falcon in june 07 . found the hotel on the internet , and we booked our rooms over the phone and just by speaking to the owner i knew that we had made the right choice of where to stay whilst in london.the hotel is very clean and the beds are &quot;propper beds&quot; extremely comfortable . the bathrooms are a decent size and we had the luxury of a power shower (room 5) two of our group had a room at the top of the hotel and it was a bit of a treck but to be fair we were told of this before we booked the room so it was our option to book it .all the staff are vvvfriendly and are on hand to advise you on &quot;how to get there&quot;? breakfasts are good and you can eat as much as you want . would stay here again without hessitation, and would reccommend it to anyone travelling to london as a great place to stay the mcneils from wales	
+	Nov 14 2009 	A beautiful home from home	I have been lucky enough to stay on my many business trips to London, and I have always found the staff to be very friendly, warm and welcoming.The rooms are very plush, roomy and tastefully decorated, situated in Mayfair with lots of eateries and classy bars within easy walking distance. There's also links to bus and underground close by, making it ideal for reaching anywhere in the capital.The atmosphere is so welcoming, I almost expect my mum to be waiting for me! I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveller coming to London who is looking for a luxurious stay at a realistic price.	
+	Aug 16 2005	Compact yet charming - a hotel with personality	Needing a room for a single night stay, I booked Flemings Mayfair on the day of my arrival in London. I had heard the hotel was good, but as I paid such a low rate, I was concerned I would be accommodated in a tiny cupboard of a room. However, this wasn't the case. Whilst the room I had was compact, it was cleverly so, and absolutely ideal for my needs. I feel like I got the bargain of the day. The facilities were excellent, the staff perhaps a little over-attentive for my liking, and the location just off Piccadilly was excellent. If I had paid full rate I may have been disappointed, but it was tremendous value at the bargain rate that I got, and it was so lovely to stay somewhere charming rather than somewhere that is just functional. It has real personality, something that seems to be very rare these days.

+	Nov 13 2004	Great B	I just came back from my London trip , we stay at this hotel for 10 nights , when we arrived after a 6 hours flight our room was ready (11.00 am )We ask for a twin bed room and it was a twin bed room , and it was freshly paint et decorated.Near the victoria station train or underground , a easy way to get around London .The breakfast what a treat and after 2 days , one of the girl who serve it already know what we order each morning. that's service....They now have sat tv but why watching tv when London offer you so many things to do...Go there it the best place I know....	
-	Feb 27 2006	Worst hotel in london ever..........	Me and 2 other friends thought that this hotel was a proper bargain but i knew that there is gonna be something wrong with this place it was filthy it smelt and the people at the front desk were horrible it was so quiet and the whole atmosphere was creepy, the people were cheeky at the desk and they made snidy comments to a friend of mine while we were downstairs. there are no lifts and the rooms are DISGRACEFUL....If ever anyone is thinking of going there DONT cause it is full of --- and more ---. There is nothing good i can say about the dump....!!!!	
+	Aug 6 2006 	Great for the price	Booked online for an average of £62/night for a double room. This is dirt cheap for central London at this time of year. Remember while reading these reviews, you get what you pay for. Back home this amount of money would get a real 4 star hotel, but in London, it does not. Things are more expensive here. If you want a room in the style of a US Hilton, you won't find it in London for under £200. However, if you want somewhere nicer than a youth hostel for not significantly more than the cost for 2 people, this is the place for you. I would stay here again.The rooms are small by comparison to american hotels, but not by comparison to other London hotels. The photos they show on the website are much bigger than the one you will get if you book online. Maybe if you pay rack-rate you'll get one of those nice big rooms with big windows, but we sure didn't. We ended up with a basement room. The window lets in enough light, and is well enough secured to protect valuables.The entryway to the hotel is lovely and edwardian, and there's a red carpet in reasonable condition leading up to it. The rooms have been refinished beautifully into a dark modern style. The in-room internet works as advertised (seems to be about 8M/1M speed) and is free. And frankly, for me, these things are what matters. One comes to London to admire London, not spend time in the hotel room.That being said, it's not perfect. Most importantly, THERE IS NO AIRCONDITIONING. After verballing the manager, he admitted to me that the feeder cable from the power company cannot handle the current draw for all the airconditioners at this time of year, and the air-conditioning has been turned off to keep power supplied for everything else. He claimed work would commence in the next week to upgrade this cable, but since I won't be here, I wonder his sincerity. It's a reasonable excuse, especially since the air-conditioners were only installed this year, but still, the end result is no air-con in sweaty humid London. This is not the place for a romantic get-away at this time of year, unless you like being really hot and sweaty.Secondly, while there are nice 40 inch plasma TVs in the room, they seem to have a policy of not replacing lost or stolen remotes. Maybe there were never any remotes in the first place, I don't know, but this means all these £1000 TV's do is make a good clock (there is a small clock in the TV's frame). It seems insane to leave a £1000 TV dormant for the want of a £9 remote, almost as crazy as the notion of stealing remote controls from hotel rooms, but maybe I just don't understand people today. The staff suggested I buy one from a retailer in Oxford St if I wanted to watch TV. I passed them up on this suggestion, so sorry if you get my room next. There is no remote.Thirdly, and finally, we come to the bathroom. A frosted glass door assures that your choices for use of facilities at night-time are to light up the entire room, to your partner's chagrin, or remain in darkness, to your peril. There is no door or curtain for the bath/shower, nor any extractor fan. Additionally, while the refit was only finished in April (or much later, if other posters are to be belived), there are brown stains in the ceiling of the bathroom of my room. The powdery nature suggests mould to me, but the pattern looks like a leak from above. Either seem feasible.The staff seem reasonably helpful, although the first three of them I spoke to had never come across the concept of an extractor fan in the bathroom and management were less than forthcoming over the exact cause of the lack of airconditioning, but they did have someone to help us to our room with bags. Again, if you're from north america, you probably won't like the staff, but don't worry, it's nothing personal, they're just not fishing for tips like many you've met back home.I haven't checked out yet, but I assume they're not going to try to trip me up with some hidden charges. They do seem honest enough.All in all though, great for the money.	
+	Jun 23 2004	Cute hotel though you get what you pay for.		
-	Aug 3 2006 	A shocker of a Hotel	The Grand Tourist Hotel in London is a disgrace. It is dirty demands up front payment the moment you check in (understandable when you see the condition of this hotel - no one would stay if they hadnt already paid), the reception staff are unusual to say the least , the rooms are of a very low standard and the breakfast is the worst I have ever experienced anywhere - cornflakes served on plastic plates, toast and if one is brave enough the worst looking scrambled eggs and baked beans. Even the tea is served in dirty pots!! The bathroom facilities are old and grotty. I think it would be impossible to enjoy a stay in this hotel and my husband and I found it necessary to stay out from daylight to late at night to avoid spending time there . The only good things about this hotel are 1. its close vicinity to Earl's Court Tube station and 2. It gets you off the streets of London at night.We would not recommend this hotel to anyone under any circumstances - try a hostel instead or any other hotel - they could not be of a lower standard than this.It was the most depressing place we have ever stayed in during our entire lives and we are well travelled people in our 50's and have visited many countries.Do NOT stay at this hotel!!!!	
+	Oct 29 2009 	Beautiful hotel and good spa and pool	I stayed at this hotel having booked online. Our room was upgraded so I don't have much to offer on the the standard rooms, save that they seem to have a good specification and if they were a quarter of the standard of the room we stayed in they are fantastic.The hotel itself is clean and very well decorated. The spa has some good deals though overall is a bit pricey for the standard treatements. The hotel pool is by far the best I've seen in a hotel I've stayed in being a full 25m long (according to the hotel literature - I didn't measure it but it looks that way).The staff are good though we found the check in and check out a little slow. The one time we had to ask staff to come to the room they did come very quickly.Overall the hotel is very good and is in a fantastic location for the City/Tower Hill area and the price we paid seemed a very reasonable rate for the standard and location.	
+	Sep 1 2004	absolutely fantastic!		
-	Jun 17 2009 	Disappointing	Our stay here was disappointing. We found the room small and stuffy, and the air conditioning was noisy and disturbing. the health club in the basement is good and the reason for giving the second star. However that cannot compensate for the disapointment of the room. Add to this that as of date of stay (June 09) there were extensive roadworks going on outside the hotel so you definitely do NOT want a room at the front, as we had. Non existent service. Hugely oerpriced.	
-	Aug 15 2003 	no air conditioning or water coolers		
+	Nov 9 2009	Overall very very good	Booked at rejsefeber.dk Stayed from 5-8 nov at room 435.Knew it was a top secret hotel.It turned out as we hoped to be an absolute bargain.Room was plenty big enough. A nice big king size bed. Bad pillows - my wife thought they were ok. Very very comfy bed. Our room overlooked the atrium inside the hotel. It was totally quiet. We did not hear a noise all night. No people, no cars, nothing. Very peaceful and amazing considering we were in the middle of London.Bathroom was nice. It was well laid out and very modern - all black &amp; white. Giant heated mirror plus lit up magifying mirror &amp; powerful modern hairdryer. Shower was lovely and water really hot. Gorgeous Moulton Brown toiletries (8 bottles!).Check in was friendly and fast. . Concierge was very friendly and helpful.We did not eat dinner at the hotel except breakfast the last morning - I did not think it was worth 23 £. Waiting staff were efficient and polite and our tea were all served hot and quickly. With arcon you can get the temperature you want in the room.Overall an absolute bargain. Right next to St Pauls, in a quiet location, near places to eat but not too busy and yet within easy tube or bus ride of anywhere you could want to go in London. Luxury hotel, very new, very modern, very clean rooms and efficient friendly staff. I	
-	May 11 2009 	grotty little room	stayed for one night, that was one too many, reception deceptively clean and tidy. room was grubby, light bulbs not working, unable to open drawers, shower head was filthy and kept falling off, light above sink broken, toilet roll holder hanging off wall, paid cash on arrival, despite booking on line receptionist only had my first name as booking reference, breakfast not too bad, but conservatory where it was served was grubby, dusty chairs and floor. will not be returning. also my bag was kept in an unsecured room opposite reception which was full of junk having been told it would be taken to my room, it was there several hours later on my return	
+	Nov 11 2009 	Great hotel but not the best	i only planned to stay there for 4night &amp; had to change rooms 3times due to a/c problems. but i did get a free upgrade. nice staff, don't plan to eat at the hotel as there is only 1 choice of restaurant and a small cafe both of which are very expensive! also not too close to commercial are lick oxford street (15-20min walk), other locations must use transportation. Hallways are like a maze, good luck finding your room. Room service was surprisingly fast!Nonetheless, i would stay here again if i had to.	
+	Dec 10 2006	Great Experience at the Grosvenor House	If not for the temporary loss of dining room due to renovations, our stay here would have been rated Excellent. The lobby lounge is doubling as the hotel dining room, which made for a somewhat uncomfortable meal (imagine your food being served on a small cocktail table, and at cocktail table height). We're aware that the price of large scale renovations can often be worse than this to guests, so not really a huge deal to us. We were welcomed to the hotel by several helpful and attentive bellmen who assisted with our bags, and gave easy, explicit directions for our rental car return. Check in was seamless, especially thanks to Christopher. Our room category was overbooked, and he offered us an upgrade with virtually no hesitation. Our Superior room was spacious, comfortable and had a very attractive decor. The bathroom was large and luxurious, and shower had excellent water pressure and temperature.Minibar/room service and temporary dining room prices are typically Marriott priced, as would be expected in a desirable city center location.And the location... FANTASTIC! Hyde Park right across the street, the shops of Oxford Street, chaos of Piccadilly and charm of Marylebone are within healthy walking distance and all the rest of London available by tube, with a stop a few blocks away.	
+	Oct 10 2007 	Somewhat deceptive website	This hotel was clean enough, but the room itself was extremely small and plain. Incongruously, the bathroom was very nice and looked liked some of the design featured on the hotel's site, which we felt was generally deceptive. We stayed for 2 nights to attend a wedding. I would feel very sorry for anyone who came for abroad for a longer stay, or London holiday on the basis of having seen the website, to receive a room like ours. The communal spaces were clean and attractive. The breakfast was OK, but we felt they could have been served until later (9am finish is rather early, especially on a Sunday). Fried breakfasts were rather small.	
+	Apr 16 2008 	Terrific	This was my secong trip booked through Virgin Vacations at the NH Harrington Hall. It's a short ride f45 min from Heathrow on the Piccadilly Line to Gloucester Road, the hotel is less then 5 min from the tube. Our room was &quot;superior&quot; not the &quot;standard room&quot; which faces the street. The standard is fine but sometimes you hear noise from the street.This superior room has a small table, lovely bathroom, mini bar - which we used to store some food, flat screen tv, and comfortable bed, our room #609 at the end of the hall away from the elevator. Included in our room package was a wonderful breakfast each day choice of eggs, bacon, sausages, various home baked breads, fruits, ceral, home made muffins etc wonderful array of choices. In a nice comfortable setting. Near the hotel is Waitrose, Sainsbury, Tesco express, Pret a Manger, great selection of place to buy some food to save on meals. I had terrific coffe at &quot;House of Coffee 149 gloucester rd around the corner from the hotel 2 mins a away, great place for a meal open from 7- 1am.	
+	Jul 8 2008 	bit of a mix	The building was beautiful (even though the online photo was a little misleading), the rooms lovely and the bed very comfortable. Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired: neither the receptionist nor the waiters were as polite as they really should have been (the waiters at times ignoring those guests who clearly needed service or having to be asked multiple times to bring food or drink), while the breakfast was delivered at a snail's pace. While there was a sense that this severe delay was not the normal state of affairs, nothing was done to rectify it.	
+	Aug 7 2007	A lovely surprise	We've stayed at Her Majesty Hotel last july. We are a family of four and stayed in one room. Although I have read the previous reviews we only really know when we get there and Her Majesty Hotel was a great surprise, the room was good, clean, the breakfast was good and the staff was really nice. They all were very polite and the manager was always making an effort to help us in whatever we needed.Althought the hotel is not in the central area it is not far from it. From the hotel you have a choice of two tube stations - central line and hammersmith and city. It is easy to find buses too. So I can assure you that while in Her Majesty you won't have transportation problems. Another thing is that around the hotel area there are a good choice of small restaurants.We totally recomend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in a good, clean and friendly hotel and wants to save their money to spend in attractions, museums etc.	
+	Aug 28 2009 	perfecto		
+	Aug 12 2009 	Wonderful experience	Our friends came for a visit and we wanted to take them to London. The decision to stay in Hilton was because of the high rating and reviews on tripadvisor on the one hand and because of the price on the other hand. The hotel is very nice.We stayed overnight so our room was a double, our friends stayed for 3 nights in a junior suit, which was lovely. The every day compliments from the hotel, nice breakfast and helpful staff made our trip wonderful.Unfortunately on the weekend the Jubilee line did not run due to works, but we used DRL that was also quite convenient.Overall the Hilton Canary Wharf is very good value for money.P.S. Internet in the rooms is very expensive!	
+	Jul 9 2008 	Great place	We spent three nights here. Although it was not in the town center it was very easy getting to it. The hotel shuttle bus drives you to the Canada Water Station to catch the Tube into town. The shuttle runs very frequently until approximately 11:00 pm. There is ample parking for your car. I actually liked having the hotel a little further away from the hubbub of the city. It is in a quiet area and you get a chance to refresh yourself. The health club is very up to date and although I didn't try the pool or spa, it looked great. The rooms were amazingly large for a European hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful.Some rooms have balconies facing the Thames and it looks lovely at night. I would definitely stay here again.	
-	Oct 25 2007 	Disappointing	I was booked into this hotel for business for a week and on arrival, it seemed quite pleasant. Although it is not in Central London or near a tube station, the hotel runs a shuttle bus every 15 minutes from the hotel to Canada Water.The people at the desk were friendly when I checked in and everything went smoothly. However, as I walked to the lift to my hotel I found that the corridors were narrow and marked and the general feel of the hotel was dated. This did not improve after I reached my room.The room was large but definitely had a 70s feel with the carpet and decor, and the carpet was damaged in some places around the room. The beds were fine, and though the bathroom was small, that was also clean.My room did have a nice view, down the river Thames, and further exploration revealed that the deck is right on the river edge and there are some lovely views in both directions.In my room the tv remote was missing, and it took me three tries at the desk to get a new one. They were apologetic, however, if I had wanted to watch the tv it was impossible to change channels without it.The food is okay, but nothing special - the room service I found was better but it is all very overpriced and there are no nearby restaurants except at the shopping center at the tube station. The meeting rooms are nice but in some of the rooms the carpets are stained although it does look like they are renovating some of the facilities.Overall I felt that the hotel was extremely expensive for what it was and if I'd booked it myself I would have been very disappointed.	
-	Oct 20 2005	Overpriced tiny noisy room	Room decoration was ok, but boy was the room tiny even by london standards. The room didnt even have a bath which wasnt mentioned when booking/checking in. If this room was cheap i wouldnt have minded, however this cost 190gbp. staff were friendly. theres certainly much better around for that amount of money. room was the nosiest i've ever stayed in - appeared to be right above where they dump the bottles from the bar - no double glazing, and a church right opposite with chiming bells every 15 mins. Not my best nights sleep ever. Breakfast was ok, however these days for whats a 3/4 star hotel i really do not believe its acceptable to provide water down orange juice. The tea was awful too.	
+	May 5 2003	Excellent staff and facilities		
-	Aug 10 2009 	BAD	We were hoping to enjoy Hilton Hotel hospitality but instead of that we had the very worst treatment that is possible!Me and my wife had a very unpleasant surprise in London. We planned a romantic weekend in London and booked and prepaid(from 22/07/2009) the hotel Hilton Hyde Park London. Some of the reasons that we booked that hotel were that it is located in an old beautiful building near a great park(Hyde Park). Unfortunately for some reason we were moved to a different hotel, that is not in the center, is a modern 3 star hotel and in a very small room. I have to mention once more... we had pre paid the room 20 days before! but for some reason there were no available!!! and despite that (which is thier mistake) we were downgraded to a diferent hotel !!! I will really consider in the future on staying in a Hilton Hotel !! Till now I have writen 3 letters to them and have received no answer! that is all ! thank you	
+	Nov 21 2007	I would go Back	Really enjoyed my stay at the Hyde Park Hilton in London. Booked using londontown.com and received a free dinner with booking, both the food and the service were very good. Free english breakfast is included (bacon, eggs, pancakes etc.). Our room was nice and clean, and had a big bathroom with a bath tub, which my wife was happy about. A lot of the other hotels we have stayed at in Europe only had stand up showers.	
+	Jun 19 2008 	Functional and convenient	I should say I'm not a fan of personality-free corporate hotel chains. That said, I booked this through lastminute.com's 'Secret Hotels' (&quot;4* in Islington&quot;) because I needed somewhere in that part of town and didn't want any hassle. The hotel did its job perfectly - no hassle, quick service, friendly staff. The room was a good size, with a comfy bed. As with other chains like this, extras were VERY expensive, but I didn't bother with them - I'm amazed people still put up with hotels charging for WiFi access. So, in summary, a good location, a trouble-free stay, very comfortable, and good value if you get a deal - but beware the extra costs if you want breakfast or internet access. (For breakfast, head across the street to the S&amp;M cafe on Essex Road - excellent sausages!)	
+	Aug 4 2007 	Great for a two night break	Having used this hotel several years ago, we were aware of its location, just slightly outside the main hotel areas. That for us was a bonus - there is a good bus service into the centre and the tube station is 5 minutes walk away and connects directly to Oxford Street and the theatre district. We found a really good Chinese restaurant - the Singapore - just up the road with a selection of pubs nearby, with prices half those in the rip-off centre of London. We had an good room overlooking the main road &amp; there was very little sound due to the excellent double glazing and the substantial trees, which seemed to soak up the sound. We found all the staff charming and pleasant, generally with a smile. Our room was smallish but very clean &amp; the bed was quite comfy. We had booked the two night break with dinner on the first night and breakfast each morning included. The rate that we got at £94.00 per night was outstanding for a London hotel of this calibre and Hilton Hotels should be congratulated for this offer, (which applies to most UK Hiltons). Dinner on the first night was ok - the food was well cooked &amp; ample, and the breakfasts were the usual Hilton buffet with every conceivable item for a breakfast available. The only criticism was that the dinner restaurant was soul-less, with some jazz music being played in the background, which sounded like a cat being strangled. There were very few takers for dinner and that didn't surprise me when the bill for extras arrived showing £3.35 for one cup of coffee! A carvery-type restaurant would be much more sensible and would get the punters in. This is an excellent hotel for a short break in London for those who want to avoid rip-off hotels offering poor value for money.	
-	May 4 2009 	Dirty old and worn	Just returned from a long weekend at the Metropole. We stayed in an executive room in the Eastwing. The room was old, worn and the bathroom not clean at all. The showerhead was full of chalk and the wall full of mould. Not what you would expect in a real Hilton. The pictures other travellers added on this site are from the renovated rooms which the eastwings does not offer. So be aware where your room is. If I return to London I will stay at an other hotel.	
+	Aug 24 2008 	Ideal base to explore London	I chose this hotel mainly due to its location - I needed somewhere to stay close to Earls Court and found this one on lastminute.com as one of their top secret deals. Upon arrival, my room wasn't ready and I was offered the choice of taking a single room instead of the double I'd booked, or waiting a little while. I opted to wait so I could explore the area - it's situauted right at the end of Kensington High Street, just a short walk from Olympia tube station (exit the station down Olympia Way, turn left at the end of the road, go over the railway bridge, cross over a road and it's on the left), and is quite an easy walk down the High Street into Kensington itself.The room I was given was on the 2nd floor and was a little on the small side for a double, but was nevertheless well-equipped and in good order with a modern, clean and well-equipped bathroom. The lightswitches were a bit tricky to fathom (a series of push-button controls and switches for individual lights), but it didn't take long. Air-con worked very well and was quiet enough not to be intrusive to sleep... which was a pleasure as the bed was one of the most confortable I've encountered in a hotel anywhere!Can't comment on the food as I stayed room-only (there's a very nice sandwich bar/cafe called Frank's opposite - a full English with tea and toast cost me £4.50), but the bar service was excellent (watch the bill though - they automatically add a discretionary 10% service charge to it) and the bar itself had a very pleasant environment.In conclusion, I was more than happy with my stay and would have no hesitation in returning.	
+	Mar 5 2008	dated but fine...	We stayed here for a couple of nights in late Feb, 2008.Yes, we'd read the reviews and yes, we did get a reasonably good deal by booking at the last minute, and whilst it was still not cheap, for London standards, the price was quite decent.The hotel itself is a little dated with need for a refurbishment as the decor was somewhat 70's, but it wasn't too bad at all really.Certainly the hotel was very clean, the staff were friendly and efficient and it was 15 minutes walk along High Street Kensington to the Kensington High Street tube station.The area itself is very safe and is close to Holland Park, Notting Hill and Kensington, so the restaurants are all quite good, it seems.Not having stayed at a Hilton previously, perhaps the standard might be a little lower than regular Hilton patrons might enjoy but overall, we would definitely stay at this hotel again, assuming we again got a decent deal.	
+	Jan 15 2008 	Average hotel with above average service	We stayed in the Hilton Olympia for one night - overall the hotel is very average - stale, tired communal areas - kind of what we've sadly come to expect from large chain hotels.On the plus side, the staff are all very friendly, happy and knowledgeable - which certainly lifts the whole experience.Our standard double room was more spacious than we were expecting, with a fairly modern bathroom.We were a little disappointed to find some rubbish in a corner that must've been missed by the cleaners.Parking is provided by the NCP under the hotel at a staggering £32 for 24 hours - it must be the dingiest car park in the UK - watch for the height restriction too - our people carrier only just made it!Despite being a HiltonHonours silver member, we were initially given a room with a view of the air conditioning ducts!! However, after a quick call through to customer services this was swiftly remedied and we were moved up to the 6th floor with a more open view over kensington High St.Overall, if you're not looking for anything too special - it's fine!!	
+	Jul 18 2007 	Better Than The Negative Reviews	I read all these reviews before I went so I had all complaints in mind. My opinion was above average and that most complaints are just that, complaints by complainers.I did ask for a newly refurbished room and was put on 8th floor in a nice size modern room. We had our six year old and they put a bed in for him without us even asking. Check-in was quite smooth and accomodating.I actually found the location fantasitic. Kensington High Street is full of shops and resturants of all kinds. Most resturants are ethnic food so if you don't like that it could be difficult. The Hare and Tortoise accross the street was a great inexpensive noodle house. The closest tube is not conventient, but just a nice morning stroll down Kensington High St gets you to a better tube station that serves the city center. Take the walk and pass places to pick up a muffin, coffee, fruit to start your day. If you don't want to walk and have a travel card, jump the buses 10, 11, 27.. and they stop accross the street from tube station. Buses are constant.Some negatives were visible, since Kensington High St is busy there is some noise, but with window closed and room fan blowing it was not an issue. The room was a bit warm and I did complain, but nothing was done. I like a cold room, but my wife was perfectly happy.I will say this is not a 4-star hotel, but a solid 3-star and since I paid little via Priceline.com I am happy. Enjoy!	
-	Apr 25 2009 	Wouldn't recommend Hilton	I already had stayed at the Hilton &amp; didn't want to change the booking at the last moment, however to my dismay this hotel though located startegically was worst than the previous hotel. The service was appalling &amp; the hotel unfriendly. Wouldn't recommend anyone.	
+	Aug 16 2008 	Convenient Hilton with Good Size Rooms	We just returned from a one night stay at the Paddington Hilton which we selected for its proximity to Paddington station for our last night in London. Literally the station is out the back door. There is a bridge from the back entrance that leads directly into Paddington station and is a two minute walk to Heathrow Express which then takes only 15 minutes to Heathrow airport. This worked for us since we had a lot of bags to carry. We checked in to a good sized well decorated and clean room and after dropping off the bags went directly into Paddington station and took the Great Western train to Windsor Castle and its beautiful town with shops and restaurants. Paddington also connects to Bath and other locations in Southern England. The Paddington underground station also makes easy connections around London and is not far from the stop for Baker Street and Madame Tussaud's. The room had a double bed and a cot for my son. A refrigerator. A wonderful sized bathroom and tub compared to pint size bathrooms in other hotels we stayed at. The hotel is an attractive building in a high traffic area on Praed Street--with bus depot, train station etc. but we did not hear traffic noises in our room which was airconditioned. I would definitely stay here again. There was a McDonald's and Burger King within one block of the hotel so it is not Knightsbridge if you want a posh area. Paid about $280 U.S. with tax via a popular hotel website deal but breakfast was not included. If booked here again would do it directly through Hilton website. Ths hotel's standard posted rates were much higher and they seemed to cater to a very weatthy Mideastern clientele and business crowd. There were families with children as well. We went out of the area to restaurants. Hotel service was generally good although they could have been friendlier upon arrival. Room was ready on time when we checked in at about 1 p.m.	
-	Feb 3 2008 	Not worth it	Me and my friend spent two nights at Hilton London Paddington. And the expericence wasnt very good.1st of all, the staff at the desk seemed to be very annoying and was more busy to write on their computers than listen to what we had to say when we checked in. That resulted in that they charged us for three nights instead of two. We also asked them for turning the sofa in the &quot;living room&quot; (we rented a suite on 1st floor) to a bed. But it wasn´t done until way asked for it a 2nd time. We asked for it the 1st time at lunch but when we got back to the hotel at 8 pm, it wasnt done, so we asked them again. There was no TV set in the &quot;living room&quot; part. (I know that it isnt requierd from the hotel but they really should have it)The desktop to the internet-TV didnt work at all, so we couldnt get online on the internet from the room. The page on the TV where we could look at our bill wasnt working either. The name was correct but where the costs was going to be shown it was just: -At the breakfast at the executive there was no white bread (toast) or boiled eggs. The milk was not cold at all and the juice wasnt pure either. For a hotel for this kind of category of price, it was really bad, expecially when one bad thing come after the other bad thing. Some may have complained about the noice from the street but both me and my friend just love it because it just gets this &quot;living on a hotel in a big city&quot; feeling. So thats was no prob. The good part was the location, inside the lively Paddington Station and along a street with many shops and restaurants. And staying at the suite was really comfortable with big rooms, a bathroom and last but not least, no queue to the breakfast.	
+	May 8 2009 	Third time here - great place	This is the third time we have stayed here and would thouroughly recommend it if you can get a good rate. A comfortable and modern hotel with quiet, clean rooms. Good buffet breakfast but expensive if not included in your rate. We really like the location right near the river and only a few minutes walk from London Bridge station to get to the West End etc.. Bar prices very expensive but I suppose you expect that. Friendly efficient staff.	
+	May 28 2008 	Fabulous!	I have just returned from a 3 day stay here and I wish I was still there! The hotel is gorgeous - modern, stylish and comfortable. The room was fab, I loved the decor and the bed was SO comfy! The staff were friendly and helpful. It is minutes from London bridge tube but it is only a few minutes walk to tower bridge which you can walk over and past the tower of london to get to Tower Hill tube which is a much more scenic and interesting way of doing things! There are stylish bars and restaurants near the hotel and so are the London Dungeons which I love! I would go there over the Tower of London anyday! The bathrooms are great too, modern and immaculate. There is a gym on the third floor and a stylish longe on the ground floor. I would go there again tomorrow if I could!	
+	Apr 2 2007 	Great hotel	Very nice modern hotel with nice large, clean rooms with lovely big comfy beds. The staff were really friendly and helpful and the location is great. I'd definitely recommend staying here it's a great choice for a London hotel.	
-	Sep 10 2009 	You can do better if you use holiday inns - much better	The Hotel - is a shiny new hotel in a modern style with typical rooms, bar and breakfast for a holiday inn. It is however a good mile and a bit from Earls Court entrance and speaking as a man who regularly walks the back streets of London at night, this isn't one I want to go back to. The streets are too quiet or frequented by the sort of people you have nothing to discuss, seriously, it's not pleasant after dark.Food outlets in the area are a rip off and prey on tourists with no prices displayed wuite often and the one I did use was average quality, top price and not overly clean.There are NO buses from the road outside into the west end, get to Kensington and change but it is close to Notting Hill and I guess 2 miles walk to the museums.At the £90 I paid, it was expensive, even without using Hotwire, you can do much better for the same money or a few pounds more.Not a fan - not going back	
+	Jun 16 2009 	Perfect for my needs	While I agree that Earl's Court is not centrally located, it's not inconvenient by any means. There are two tube stations within walking distance and a bus that stops in front. The neighborhood is very down to earth. Restaurants and pubs of every type are located within walking distance. Everything from Middle Eastern, to Italian, to Spanish and Ethiopian Food. During the day there is a minimarket south on North End Road where the banks are located.The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. Special thanks to the friendly Night/Early Morning desk manager who negotiated an airport cab rate on our behalf and argued for us when the cabby tried to state a different price. Special thanks to the weeknight security guard who was extremerly friendly and always had to let us in at off hours.The room was nice, clean, and soundproof.The free continental breakfast was decent but I loved it because it was free! They provided, fresh grapefruit, peaches, various kinds of yogurt, cold cereal, two types of cheeses, various juices, plain and chocolate crossaints, prepacked chocolate and blueberry muffins, white and wheat bread for toast, various jams and butter, and coffee, tea, and various fruit juices. The staff was always on the ball and you never had to wait long for them to put out fresh dishes or food.Internet access is a bit steep. 4 pounds for 30 mins, 6 pounds for 4 hours, and 15 pounds for the whole day.This hotel was perfect for my needs.	
+	Apr 19 2009 	impeccable		
+	Feb 13 2008 	Clean reasonable price...great location for nightlife	This is a pretty reasonably priced hotel for London. The property itself is very clean, well-designed and the rooms are large-ish and again clean and trendy-ish (but not cutting edge). The staff were friendly and efficient and the (included) complimentary breakfast was pretty good.The real reason to stay here is the location. It's out of central London but it's less than two/three minutes to the Old Street Station and maybe 15 mins walk to Liverpool Street.But, it's right in the middle of some of the best nightlife that London has to offer. Trendy, independent bars and clubs. Great ethnic restaurants (including a handful of Vietnamese restaurants that are superb...Little Hanoi - less than 50 yards away - won some cheap dining award and was superb on my visit) and probably 15 mins walk to Brick Lane(although there are a few Indian restaurants on your doorstep).There are also quite a few strip pubs/clubs (not rip-off places) nearby. These might be a plus or a minus to some but they're easily avoided if that's not your thing.For a tourist or casual visitor, a night out around here is far better- and far cheaper - than the tourist trap of central London.	
-	Nov 14 2009 	Room problems long delay in fixing it.	I recently booked a twin bedded room at this hotel. On arrival at 2pm both beds were zipped together. I immediately pointed this out to the reservation staff and they told me that my Holiday Inn profile was for a King size bed. I told them that was irrelevent as I had booked on this occasion a twin bedded room. I told them we needed to go out but would return later that afternoon, they told me that the problem would be fixed before our return. On our return the problem was not fixed and they said they had no staff sio we would have to change rooms. The new room was no where near as good as the original and faced the road so was noisy. Furthermore people calling the hotel for us were told we were not at the hotel, they had not logged the room change. This problem dogged us for 2 days and we never did gat any of the messages people left. All in all a pretty poor effort on their behalf.	
-	Oct 23 2008 	Disappointing internal catering	Whilst the rooms are satisfactory our experiences in the bar/bistro were very disappointing and we could not recommend eating an evening meal in house especially when there is a very good Chinese restaurant on the ground floor. This would appear independently run from the hotel. We ate here on the 2nd night of our stay and enjoyed the meal.On the evening of our arrival quite late my wife and I decided to eat in house after a long drive to the hotel. We ordered at about 9.20pm and waited... and waited. Just after 10pm I enquired where our order was. What was brought to the table had obviously been standing for some considerable time and looked very unappetising. I had scampi - there were 5 very small dried up pieces of scampi on the plate with accompaniments. My wife's risotto looked like dried up mush and was obviously made with the wrong rice. I showed both dishes to the manager who did clear our bill. Not the first time we have had a poor dining experience at Holiday inn in the UK.We filled in the crit but have had no contact from the hotel in terms of follow up.	
+	Jan 27 2004	Value for Money		
+	Jul 27 2009 	Excellent Choice	I stayed in the hotel with my spouse and a 12 year old daughter, for 8 days from 17th to 25th of June, for a leisure trip to London. The check in was one of the most amazing one as it took me less than 30 seconds as all my things were ready, along with a voucher for free surfing for 4 hours. I guess like everyone else has mentioned, that the location is simply unbeateable if you plan to visit London by the tube.Though the area around the hotel is not too exciting, but who cares, if your only aim is to visit London and its attractions. You are just 20 to 40 minutes away to any place of your choice in zone 1 &amp; 2.A special mention about the staff. THEY WERE EXCELLENT. You cannot expect better and most helpful service in London. GUYS KEEP UPTHE GOOD WORK.I certainly plan to return back soon.	
+	Nov 21 2009 	Great value hotel that allows easy access to central London	I stayed for three nights. The room is relatively spacious and it was quite and comfortable. The service was good and the tariff provided great value for money. It is easy to get to one just takes the Victoria Line to Canning Town and the hotel is just 100 metres down the road. They provided a continental breakfast. There was good value dining in the evening. All up a good place to stay.	
-	Jul 19 2009 	This hotel was the worst part of an otherwise lovely trip to London	Since I have had good experience with Holiday Inn hotels in the past I was not expecting any of the problems that we encountered at this hotel. To begin with, the room faced a busy main street which made the room terribly noisy at all hours of the day and night. The beds were uncomfortable, particularly the sofa bed which was hardly suitable as a bed. Even though we stayed at the hotel in the middle of the summer, albeit of the London type, the blankets were ridiculously warm (heavy comforters), and the room temperature control did not function properly. All of this amounted to a miserable stay in the hotel which almost spoiled our vacation. The only positive things that I have to say about this hotel are that the breakfast was quite nice and fresh, and that the underground station was conveniently close.	
+	Jul 27 2008 	Good Old HI !	I have stayed at HI Bloomsbury on many occasions in the past for work, so had no problem choosing it for the night before our journey to Europe on Eurostar.On arriving at the hotel I asked for, and got, an upgrade (don't ask, don't get). I was given a 'business class' room on the sixth floor which was quiet, clean and comfortable - when given the choice of sooo many pillows it would be remiss not to have a decent nights sleep.We left before breakfast in the morning, refreshed and ready for our journey. Some reviews have complained about the £11.50 price tag for a breakfast of fruit, croissants, bacon, eggs, coffee.... need I go on? This is what it costs for up to 2 adults, not each!!! I paid nearly £10 for a couple of coffees and a baguette at a cafe in St Pancras - now thats what I call expensive.	
-	Jun 28 2005	A Terrible Stay in a Good Location	This was one of the most infuriating hotel experiences I have ever had. The hotel lobby looks nice, but not nearly nice enough to make up for everything else the hotel lacks. Our room was small and located above what seemed to be London's Noisiest Street. My sleep was disrupted (and I am a deep sleeper) almost every night because of the voices, cars, and loading trucks coming from outside. Housekeeping did the bare minimum, not even bothering to supply us with additional bathroom tissue when we were almost through our last roll (afterwards that's when the kleenex came in handy). The worst part of all was that we asked for a wake-up call for 6am and they failed to give us one, causing us to nearly miss our flight to Barcelona that morning. The hotel staff had little reaction to this error on their part and they were far from apologetic. Despite its good location, I would never consider staying at this hotel again.	
+	Oct 2 2007 	Gute Qualität für ein Hotel im Großraum London		
-	May 1 2009	Great stay until duty manager said the wrong thing.	We just checked out of the Camden Lock Holiday Inn today. This would have gotten a higher rating from me except for the little glitch at checkout. First the positives. Everybody, except the last guy we dealt with, are friendly and informative. The area is very interesting and in some respect more interesting than the typical tourist areas of London. The tube station is about a 5 minute walk away and it is very easy to get anywhere you want. The area is a madhouse on the weekends but that just reinforces how interesting the area is.The room is probably larger than most European hotel rooms. We booked one with 2 double beds. It was clean and the beds were ok. Housekeeping was an issue. There was only 1 glass in the bathroom and it never got replaced or washed out. After the third day without a new bar of soap (and our existing soap becoming a sliver), we had to ask the front desk for some. They put some shower gel in the shower on the third day. The room was still clean but replenishing the supplies was a bit lacking.The restaurant is ok for dinner. In fact, we hate heated up pub food so we ate in the hotel twice and it was fine. The servers are very nice and friendly. Breakfast was ok...but you do get sick of buffet English breakfast. Luckily, there were sticky buns, cereal and fruit to pick from if you got tired of bacon, sausage and black pudding. The eggs come scrambled or you can ask your server for fried, boiled, omlettes etc and they'll bring it to your table. There was also baked beans, tomato, and cold cuts. The orange juice was fresh squeezed and quite delicious. The servers could try to refill coffee and tea more often but it's a minor quibble.The lobby has a lounge with a bar and very comfortable seats. I actually enjoyed sitting there.Bad stuff... internet wifi was 15 GBP per 24 hour period. We decided to forego the hotel internet connection and purchased a T-Mobile internet dongle and pay as you go service instead ... as suggested by somebody on the Tripadvisor forum (Carphone Warehouse, T-Mobile etc are just down the street near the tube station). However, the room we were given, on the 1st floor, was like a cave. Our view opened up on some roof area with walls on either side. This meant our connection to a G3 signal was horrible if we sat where the desk was located (near the window). Our signal improved as we got closer to the hallway and was great if we sat in the lobby. Oh well. There are worse things than sitting in the lobby lounge. It was actually quite nice.Now for the check-out glitch that has annoyed us. We booked the room using a CAA/AAA which meant we had no breakfast included. At check-in, we were asked if we wanted to purchase breakfast vouchers for 9.95 GBP each. We decided to do so since it would save us time and the price wasn't too horrible. We told them that we couldn't use a voucher on our last morning though since we had an early train to catch. She gave us 5 vouchers for 5 mornings of breakfast. One evening, we realized that we couldn't use another voucher because we had a bus tour that we had to leave for early in the morning. We asked the front desk if it would be possible to return the vouchers for a refund. If they said &quot;no&quot;, we'd have a VERY quick breakfast before leaving on our tour otherwise, we'd get breakfast while on the tour. The front desk clerk said it was no problem and took back the vouchers and said they would take the charge off of our bill. When we checked out, not only was that breakfast still on our bill, they had charged us for breakfast for the day we arrived too. We arrived at 2 pm...no way for us to have eaten breakfast. The duty manager, who checked us out (Osman) reluctantly took off both breakfasts. &quot;Reluctantly&quot;, I say, because he first questioned when we arrived as if he didn't believe me when I said we arrived in the afternoon and then chastised us for returning the other voucher. He told us that in the future, we would not be allowed to return breakfast vouchers. I said, &quot;In that case, in future, we won't stay here.&quot; He replied that was our choice. Hold on here....we ASKED if we could return it and they said yes. And now here's this guy saying we shouldn't have been allowed to return them and blaming US for this &quot;problem&quot;. If they had said we couldn't have returned it, we would have stayed for breakfast. When we told him this his reply was it must have been somebody new at the desk and he/she shouldn't have allowed it. Well...fine...but BLAME and chastize your employee, not the customer. Talk about ridiculous. THAT soured an otherwise good experience at this hotel and if if they intend to employ such a person as a MANAGER, then we won't be staying there again. Ironic since we had just said to ourselves that we'd come back without hesistation. Well...too bad...lots of hesitation now. Somebody needs to be sent on a course for customer service. It's amazing how 20 seconds or ill chosen words can leave a bad taste in your mouth.	
+	Jan 27 2009 	Excellent value and location for central London	Paid £63 on priceline, £62 on hotwire for this hotel and thought it was excellent value.Great location in Camden Lock, five minutes walk away from tube to Central and City of London. The location itself is quite an attraction too.Modern hotel with nice rooms and functional bathroom.Would recommend even for the non priceline/hotwire rate.	
+	Jan 28 2009 	Perfectly fine given the great rate!	We spent a Saturday night in this hotel, having decided at only a few days' notice to travel into London for the weekend.We got a terrific deal at only £59 for a twin room, so our expectations were moderate. It's a great location (we had previously stayed at the Millennium Gloucester Road across the street, so we knew it was a good spot) - literally a minute's walk to Gloucester Road tube station, 5 mins walk to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and the British Science Museum.Our room - and the hotel generally - was dated, looking a bit tired. But we were very content with the beds, the cleanliness and so on. The windows open so you can get fresh air if you want.We didn't bother with the usual overpriced buffet breakfast - because there is a 'Paul' patisserie on Gloucester Road, opposite the tube station. We did have a sandwich and a cup of coffee in the lobby cafe after we checked in - absolutely fine.This hotel was perfectly adequate; wouldn't necessarily aim to stay there again, or wish to stay more than a couple of nights. But for the price, and the favourable location, we were content.	
+	Dec 15 2008 	Great Hotel for a great price	Our room (two single beds) was very comfortable, cosy and most importantly very clean. We had a mini fridge and iron and ironing board which was convenient. Lots of channels to watch on TV. Staff very friendly and polite. One or two downsides to staying at this hotel: (1) Slightly noisy - if you're facing Cromwell road the noise from the underground train is not great from 6am till midnight especially if you can only sleep with the windows open. (2) Heating was weak - but then we asked for a cool room. Otherwise it was so convenient: (1) You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money. (2) You are 5 minutes away from the station (3) You are in a great part of town full of nice restaurants. Rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished. Really had a nice experience!	
+	Jul 15 2008	good hotel	I booked this hotel via Holiday inn ,2 nights for the price off 1 .The rooms are clean average UK size .The rooms have air con and the windows do open .The windows have two layers off double glazing making them soundproof. A lot of hotels in the area are converted houses this hotel is purpose built .I paid a promotion rate off £109 for two nights .Without the promotion rate it was aprox £300 .Good location ,near the tube .I could see the tube line from my room on the 15th floor .	
+	Jun 21 2007 	A fine hotel and great location	The rooms here are clean and no smaller than any comparable London hotel. The advantages are proximity to two 24-hour supermarkets, plus a Waitrose, good pubs, and the Underground. The lobby is well-appointed and there are many good alternatives to the hotel restaurant. Overall an excellent place to be based for work -or recreational-stays in London.	
+	Dec 2 2006	Stay here - you won't regret it- great price - great location	I booked a double room on Lastminute by using their secret hotel booking system. I paid £144 for two nights in late November excluding breakfast. (Would definitely use secret hotel again by the way).I can't say anything bad about our stay at this hotel. Arrived quite late in the day so check-in was extremely quick and the member of staff who dealt with us was polite, friendly and efficient. We were given a standard double room on the 27th floor which is the top floor. The views were spectacular, we could see loads of Londons landmarks including Harrods - all beautifully lit up for Christmas.The room itself was everything you would expect for a 4 star chain hotel. Very clean, average size for a London hotel with tea/coffee making facilities and TV etc. More than worth the money we paid.The Hotel location was absolutely perfect for sightseeing and shopping. A short walk to the Natural History Museum and the Albert and Victoria Museum, then 10 minutes further to Harrods and all of the Knightsbridge shops. The nearest tube is Gloucester Road which was right beside the Hotel. Locally the area is great, loads of lovely places to eat or shop. Tesco's is opposite the tube and Waitrose is equally close, perfect for breakfast etc. We ate at a fantastic steak restaurant called Black and Blue - the best steak I have ever tasted.There are two Holiday Inn Hotels in Kensington, the other is nearby and is probably a nicer hotel so not to be confused when booking. However, reviews on this site refer to this Holiday Inn as a high-rise monstrosity which I think is unfair. There are 27 floors to this hotel and if you are looking for individuality or boutique - forget it! Overall, for the money, location, and for the piece of mind knowing that its going to be clean and comfortable, look no further.I am fussy and trawled the internet looking at London hotels, goodness knows how I was brave enough to book a secret hotel room. No regrets and would definitely recommend.	
-	Jul 24 2006	Not so good	We had 4 twin rooms booked and prepaid two months in advance for one night on 10th July 06. When we arrived, we were asked by the receptionist what room we wanted. We told him that we specifically booked for four twin rooms. No comments were given by the receptionist.Then we were asked if we wanted rooms nears to each other. Our answer was yes but if they could not do it, we will be ok with all the rooms on the same floor. No comments were given by the receptionist.When we were given the keys, to our surprise, two of the rooms were double and were on the different floor to the other two. When asked, the receptionist's reply was that he could not do what we asked for.Furthermore, one of the room given was occupied by someone else and we could not open one room with the key given. We had to ask the receptionist twice for them to realize that they have given us a wrong key.In conclusion, rooms were small but clean, internet charge was expensive (15 Pounds/day) and reception staff/booking system was hopeless.	
+	Apr 17 2009	Affordable Clean Perfect location	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. When we arrived our rooms were not ready but we were able to leave ours bags there which was handy. Greenpark tube station is just around the corner. Buckingham palace is a short 5 min walk through Green Park and the hotel is also a short walk from Piccadilly Circus. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. We had a buffet breakfast each morning which was okay but nothing special. As we were in London for sightseeing the location was perfect. I would definitely recommend this hotel.	
+	Sep 28 2006 	loved this hotel	I trawled through the internet for hotel reviews and finally settled on the Holiday Inn Mayfair due to its location. Booked this hotel on a 3 day advance booking (inc breakfast) for £112.00 ex VAT for 1 night 23 sep 2006. Occasion for hubby's birthday. Arrived at hotel at 9 am and was able to leave luggage with concierge until room was ready. First impressions were hotel lobby was clean and nice with comfy seating area and friendly staff. Bedroom was lovely - spacious, extremely clean, nicely decorated( no worn/scratched furniture or saggy bed as seen in other reviews) and aircon in good working order. Ate very nice dinner in hotel restaurant which again was clean and nicely decorated with lovely comfy armchairs to sit in. Food was not overly expensive and was cooked very well and both hubby and I had left clean plates for all courses. Breakfast was really nice (and plenty of it). Location is excellent - 1 minute walk Green Park tube station, Theatreland 10 min walk, shopping districts all within walking distance. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will be staying again next year.	
+	Apr 2 2007 	Functional business hotel but quite priceyfor tourists.	I have been using this hotel as a business user for a while. Much quieter hotel (due to good double glazing as well as location) than its sister hotel in Russell Square but not quite as nice an area.Rooms are ok, bit small especially the bathrooms, not ideal for the larger user like myself. Being a loyalty card holder makes no difference here for some reason. They seem to have a problem with newspapers being taken from outside rooms as well. Staff are helpful but, as with most hotels, little recognition of guests even when long staying.Food seems reasonable if not exciting but with a variety of restaurants and coffee shops, breakfast especially is significantly cheaper and tastier outside unless incorporated in the cost of the room. A couple of small supermarkets are close as well. Nice restaurants especially around Googe Street. Internet is available but at a silly price, there is an internet cafe near by but closes at 6pm.Safes are provided in the rooms and the iron I was supplied with was clean and in good condition. TV reception was fine, limited channels and SKY One can have problems but the hotel staff fixed it quickly when I was there. Transport is good with Great Portland Street and Warren Street near by and plenty of buses to Euston and King's Cross.Regents park is only a few minutes away, nice on a summer's day.	
+	Dec 28 2006 	Perfectly servicable	It amazes me to see such negative reviews about the Holiday Villa. I don't understand what people expect from a hotel in London that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. We stayed at the Holiday Villa London for 6 nights - upon arriving early, we checked our bags at the front desk and set off to explore. The hotel is around the corner from the Queesway and the Bayswater underground stations, so it's incredibly convenient to both the Circle and the District lines. The location is wonderful, with Kensington Gardens down the road. The Bayswater area is full of restaurants, pubs and bodegas. The hotel itself is nothing special at all, but it is far from horrendous. Our room was tiny, but always clean. The coffee and tea service was replenished daily. The continental breakfast was meager, but who needs more than some toast and tea in the morning? For the price we paid, we were more than satisfied. As long as you realize that you're not going to be staying at a Hilton, you'll be fine.	
-	Jul 12 2008 	Be wary of booking here	We have booked here twice. The first occasion (April, '08) was satisfactory, average in all categories, for the price. The second was for our son's wedding nearby, in which we had a key organisational role. The booking for 3 nights (early July '08) was made 2 months in advance, and PREPAID. With 2 weeks to go an e-mail was received cancelling the booking, and returning payment on credit card. Likewise a booking for family friends made at same time as ours. Reason? -- urgent refurbishment. Phoned hotel, but couldn't get past reception, who were unhelpful, and their explanation unconvincing. Spent worrying few days trying to arrange alternative at short notice (LateRooms very helpful here). Have never encountered such disgraceful behaviour from a British hotel before, and advise anyone thinking of booking here to consider carefully. Is this operation basically unreliable?	
+	Apr 25 2005	Perfect spot/price	perfect spot since it's near the victoria station,restaurants and the major sights and spots! very nice staff.	
+	Jan 15 2009 	a perfect hotel experience... far exceeded expectations	My husband and I spent a wonderful 5 nights in the very special hotel during the last week of November 2008. We were unsure of what to expect and we were completely delighted by every experience we had at Hotel 41.The staff are the best we have encountered in 30 years of International Travel. they were effecient , unobtrusive, professional and friendly at the same time and always there. Nothing was a problem and we felt they always went the extra mile to make sure we were Ok. They would always greet us with a smile and an enquiry as to how our day had been. When we checked in, very exhausted after a long flight from Sydney, they greeted us with a comfortable chair and a glass of champagne in the magnificient reception room and made sure the whole check-in process was simple, efficient and quick. In fact it was like staying at a grand luxurious yet understated private home We then walked to our beautiful room where we were greeted by a spotlessly clean, elegant, comfortable room. Not your typical hotel room in anyway, this one , with its black and white theme had all the comforts and special touches of a home away from home. every detail is taken care of, fluffy towels, hot water bottle, the most comfortable , clean bed mattress and linen you will ever experience, clean carpet, olives and lemon in your room and complimenary water every night.It is simply too difficult to write all of the wonderful features of Hotel 41, you need to experience it for yourself. Andrew and team you are the best, please keep up the good work. Thank you for making our stay in Londen ( our 6th) perfect.	
+	Sep 15 2005	Top Drawer	I adored everything about this hotel: location, staff, breakfast, late night cappucino, specutacular furnishings in room. I've travelled around the world, and this hotel ranks in the top three, all time, for me.	
+	Sep 29 2008 	Good value for the location	This was originally a large house, which has been successfully renovated into a nice comfortable hotel. They have made a real effort to keep some of the original features of the building, whilst installing a contemporary modern décor. They have managed this very successfully. The bedroom and bathroom was of a small to moderate size, however it was very clean and the room had some nice touches. The bed was very comfortable and a good size. The employees were lovely and very helpful. The breakfast was of a good quality but small in choice. The bar is expensive even by London standards. If you want to stay in this particular part of London you will not find a better hotel for anywhere close to the same price. It knocks the spots of the national chains of hotel, which are priced similar. I would definitely go back.	
+	Dec 11 2007 	Lets not get carried away	The previous reviewer I would suggest has got carried away with what IMHO is a good utility hotel worth what you pay for it. A box with rooms however with a great view over the London dock area.No real facilities apart from a reception and combined bar/eating area. Location v good for both ExCel, O2 Arena and not much of Tube ride into Central London.However, it;s basic albeit clean and quiet.Bed somewhat hard, a tardis of a bathroom but fine if all you want is some shut eye during the night. By day it;'s right under the London City airport flightpath.It was worth the £65 I paid for the room. Nothing more but certainly as a crash pad after last nights Led Zeppelin concert it was quite, convenient, clean and not too uncomfortable.If I'd taken my wife, and I'd been the other end of London we would have stayed at the ParkCity in Kensington. OK not in the same price league, and not convenient to the O2 but divisions better.For what it is, and where it is I'd suggest you're ok at this hotel as long as you're looking for a bed, a shower and a beer.	
+	Mar 23 2005 	Great Hotel!		
+	May 6 2008 	OK for a flying visit	We stayed at the Hotel Meridiana atthe end of April 2008. we were travelling to France the next day and wanted a stop-over hotel near St. Pancras.The location of the Meridiana is excellent if you are travelling to/from St. Pancras or King's Cross. It is literally two minutes walk from the entrance of both stations. It faces a tennis court and small square with trees, which, apart for the odd group of teenagers, is pretty quiet. The area was fine at night and we did not feel threatened or worried when we returned at around 22:30-23:00 at night. Our room was small and basic, as was to be expected. It had tea/coffee making facilities and a very, very small toilet and shower; however, it was unusual to get an en suite at this price so I should not complain! The TV was very high up, which made viewing quite difficult and the bed was very small. The whole hotel, and our room, was very clean and tidy.The major problem came in the form of noise. Any time anyone flushed their toilet we had five to ten minutes of noise in our room, also the door to each room had to be slammed to shut it, so that added to the decibels over night. We could hear those above us and next door when they got up - at 6:00am - the next day, too.The breakfast was also not good at all. The breakfast room had only four tables, so others had to be turned away whilst we ate. It was stiflingly hot, with a electric fire piping out heat. I had been told the hotel did not offer a vegetarian option at breakfast, so asked for corn flakes and a fried egg and beans. No cereal ever arrived. We had instant coffee and very greasy eggs, my husbands &quot;full English&quot; consisted on one wizen sausage, one piece of bacon, a spoon of beans and one egg. We had two bits of toast with this. The staff were fine, the hotel clean and the location great for our onward journey; however, I would not use the hotel again because I got very little sleep and the breakfast was awful.	
+	Apr 1 2006	Great position good hotel good prices	Very central and very close to main tube-station. In really quite and nice location. Good breakfast and very helpfull and friendly staff. Probably the room are too small, but if you need it just to sleep is a good accomodation. Absolutly I will use it again for my next trips to London.	
-	Jul 6 2008 	OK if you're stuck	I stayed in a single room as a walk-in guest and received about 5% discount from the rack rate (for the last available room). The room was a decent size, and it had a nice view of the square across the road. The air conditioning unit worked really well. There was a kettle with tea and nescafe. These are the only real positives. Everything else was either average or below average. In particular, as mentioned by others, sound travels from the other rooms. Also, the water pressure in the shower was minimal.If you are stuck and want to avoid a B&amp;B, then this might work for a short stay. Otherwise I would recommend looking around for something with better value-for-money.Wireless Internet was available (approx 9 pounds for 24 hours' access).	
-	Aug 16 2004	Rubbish!	Booked the hotel for a week 9th-13th July 04. Tried to checked in at 8am. waited an hour (no receptionist) was given a £30 a night basic room. Told to pay the full fee in advance. The room was filthy bedspread dirty and stank! bedside cabinet and wardrobe falling to bits. Sat on the bed only to be greeted by a collection of insects including flea's crawling up my arm!! refused to give me another room and refused to give me money back, a very nasty experience from a very nasty hotel! Checked in at the Montana just a few doors down, lovely clean room, 24hr reception, excellent breakfast for the same money! Advise check out other hotels in the area, all are far better.	
+	Aug 16 2009 	The Coolest hotel in the coolest part of London	OMG! This place was cool. We loved The Hoxton from the moment we walked into the place. The staff is great, the rooms are clean, new, spacious and oh so stylish. Walking around the area was so fun. Too many good restaurants to choose from and the tube station just around the corner (along with a much appreciated Starbucks to kick off the day)The restaurant at The Hoxton was fantastic and the staff will try to please you in every way. Just ask.	
+	May 8 2009 	The Hox Rocks!	It all begins with the lobby, half of which is a bar/restaurant in the center of which is the check in/out counter and its very helpful friendly attendants. The lobby is full of people most of the time coming or going, eating, hanging out or using the free computers.There is an outdoor patio area which must be great in the summer. It might put off some older travellers but I loved it - nothing cold, lonely or impersonal about the lobby,.The rooms are not huge but the quality of the fiurnishings and fittings is excellent. The window curtains are thick and keep out the light if you need to sleep. The large TV monitors tilt and come with a keboard. Fabulous beds with down duvets and pillows. Great shower head large bathroom mirror, free Pears soap - a large bar, not that sample sized stuff, nice towels. I do wish they had a luggage rack but otherwise no complaint,. The overall style is industrial/modern . Can't say the window views are beautiful but I do not go to hotels to stare out the window.I was OK with the bagged breakfast but supplemented it with some groceries purchased across the street (several small shops in the area sell food which you can stash in your imini fridge) I found their restaurant breakfast not great for the money. Lots of reasonably privced restaurants in the area.One great thing is they give you two free bottles of water per day and they are very welcome &quot;travel companions&quot; as you go about your sightseeing.Hotel is not far from the Old St. tube station (Northern Line). The closest neighborhoods of interest are its own (lots of interesting small shops and galleries -- worth exploring) Soho, Camden Town and Hampstead Heath are all easy to get to on the tube, as are the City / Southwark (The Tower, Globe Theatre, London Dungeon, Tate Modern, Etc.) Going to Buckingham Palace area and Chelsea on the tube takes about an hour -- it's do-able but not convenient. The museums and Harrods are accessible if you dont mind changing a few trains.A very pleasant surprise at the end of my stay (5 nights) was the phone bill -- long distance calls are most reasonable, a tenth of what other hotels will stiff you for.I would recommend the Hox HIGHLY to anyone who loves the older parts of the city and not so much for those who want to spot royals, do luxury shopping, or see Big Ben. It is an excellent hotel with a great attitude.	
+	Oct 10 2008 	It's true!	OK, a lot of enthusiastic reviews, a design hotel in the middle of a trendy and young London area (Shoreditch) with underground and nice markets just minutes away, fair price: where is the problem? No problem: everything is true.Hoxton is that nice hotel whith that nice price: stylish room with big bath room, free Internet (wifi and cable) everywhere, light breakfast from Pret-a-manger included.I'll come here for sure next time in London.	
+	Jun 6 2007 	It's 100% true	Spent 2 nights in Hoxton in May 19 and 20. First impression was good already! The hotel lobby looks exactly like website. I arrived in the morning so the room was not ready yet. Staff were kind enough to put my luggage to the storage room!Checked in late afternoon. Very fast and smooth process. I have to say all staff are very friendly, and they have the passion to work!Room was very clean, and very spacious! Room is tastfully decorated. The cushion on bed add some fun to it! There is no bath but shower, which also makes the bathroom looks bigger. There is a piece of Pear soap provided. My suggestion is: Provide 2-3 smaller sizes of soap, so that guests can use differnt soap to wash hands and take a shower.Free breakfast deliver to your door is also a PLUS! The whole idea is just cute and so handy! Because last day of our stay, we had to rush to waterloo station. So we can just grab the bag and go!The hotel is not located in the core area. But Old Street tube station is only 5-8 mins walk. But make sure you take the right exit.I got lost one day since I mixed up the exit no. of tube! I tried to make a long distance call from hotel room. It didn't work at the beginning so I called front desk. Still didn't wor. I called them at least 3 times but staff were very patient. At the end they sent a staff come up the room (it was around 11pm) to fix it for me. When I checked out, the long distance bill was very reasonable. A 10 min long distance call to Canada, only cost me 30p!!! It's 100% true fromthe website: No rip off charges!!!I highly recommand it to travellers with no kids. It would be a perfect place for business people (there are 4 computers at the lobby to use). This place is not only good for young people, but alsoolder crowd. But mind that the hotel is in a trendy mood and staff wear polo shirt. If you are looking for traditional hotels like Hilton, with the uniform dressed porter service, don't stay here.I won't stay in other places except Hoxton, if I'm going back to London.	
+	Nov 28 2006 	Good value and not TOO trendy	Just stayed at the Hoxton to be near a reception. Not the nicest area of London - but very much and up and coming bit of the capital. Good restaurants and bars near the place and very near the tube (unfortunately nearest the Northern Line which is rarely fun!) Easily walkable to Moorgate and the city.Rooms are decently laid out and the beds are comfortable. Nice flat screen TV and good on screen help. Nice touches - free half pint of milk for tea loving Brits and real Pear's soap. Shower (large head dropping water directly on your head) excellent - and nice layout (I am 6 foot 2). Breakfast a bit spartan but was good quality. Staff were very friendly and helpful - and no too hopelessly trendy. I booked the day of travel - but still paid only £129 (about 240 dollars). Will happily stay here again.	
-	Mar 27 2009 	Bed Bugs  Disgusting experience at the Ibis	I stayed a the Ibis hotel on 2nd Feb, I have stayed here before without incident but my experience on that night means Ill never set foot in any Ibis hotel ever again.After a tiring day on a training course I got to my room and crashed out on the bed until about 9.30pm when I woke up I felt something crawling in my hair. I brushed it with my hand and a small insect fell onto the bed. I crushed it and a lot of blood came out of it (I didnt know at that time that that was MY blood). Then I felt something else crawling in my hair as I shook my head several more of these insects fell on the bed. I jumped up in disbelief and lifted the pillow to see more of these creatures scurry for cover. I rang reception and told them that I wanted a different room because there was some kind of infestation in my room. They told me that they couldnt give me another room because they were fully booked. I was pretty insistent with them at this point and they said theyd call me back. Fifteen minutes later reception called me and said someone would be up with another room key. After a while a security man turned up at the door, handed me another room key and demanded the key to the room I was in. I told him I hadnt packed, so he said just drop it at reception and went to leave. I was pretty amazed that the Manager hadnt come up. I said to the security man, dont you even want to see this, he reluctantly came into the room but was quite horrified by the bugs crawling around on the bed. I gathered my belongings pretty much still phased by the experience and got in the lift to my new room. There were a couple of women in the lift and, as you do, you look toward the floor where I thought I noticed something crawling on my scarf. I looked more closely and there were some of these bugs on there. I crushed them, I dont know if the women noticed but I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me I felt so dirty and grimy.When I got in my new room I took all my clothes and shook them in the shower, and then showered myself  several times.Then I went down to reception to ask to speak to the manager, but had to speak to the duty manager instead.Now this is where it really gets disturbing. She didnt act in any way like this was an out-of-the-ordinary event. She said sorry and said that I didnt have to pay for my room but far from being shocked at my experience acted like it was an everyday matter. I asked to speak to the manager and she said Id have to come back in the morning.I didnt sleep much that night, I could still feel those things crawling all over me.I went to reception in the morning and asked to speak to the manger but amazingly he had the same attitude. Apologetic, but not surprised by my experience. He offered me a free weekend at the hotel with my wife!!!! Really! Would you take someone you care about back to that!?I cant begin to tell you how grimy and disgusting this experience made me feel. I have been unable to write about this until now and even now it is making my skin crawl. To this day whenever I feel a slight itch I look down because I still feel those things crawling on me.I would save yourselves this grim experience.	
+	Mar 29 2007 	Decent Affordable Hotel	I stayed at the Ibis London City for two nights in March and, overall, was pleased with my stay. It is conveniently located next to a tube stop, and is not far from St. Paul's and the Tower of London. My room was very clean and well-kept. Though amenities were sparse (no mini-bar, only one towel per person, etc.), I felt I had everything I needed for a short visit. My friend and I paid about $200 total for our 2-night stay, breakfast included. This was, by far, the best deal I found for hotels in the heart of London, and I did my fair share of research. At the Ibis, you get what you pay for. There are no luxuries, but it was much nicer than staying at a hostel or a privately-run &quot;budget&quot; hotel (which can be hit-or-miss).Our double room was fairly large, and the bathroom had very modern fixtures. I was impressed with the water pressure in the shower -- better than most American hotels! There was plenty of room for our suitcases (and I had been coming from a longer stay in the UK, so I had lots of stuff!). Maybe it was my exhaustion after nonstop sightseeing, but I found the bed to be very comfortable. The breakfast was a lovely continental spread, with plenty of rolls, croissants, bread, muffins, cereal, fruit, yogurt, and beverages. Well worth the money spent. We also dined at the in-hotel restaurant for supper, which was quite delicious, convenient, and affordably priced.The one complaint I have concerns the front-desk staff. Most of the people working at the front desk did not speak English very well, which proved to be a problem when checking in and later getting directions. I had to repeat my name over and over again until finally, I had to write down my name for the guy in order for him to understand it (and it's a very common American/English/Irish name). The next day, when we asked for directions to the nearest Catholic church, another reception clerk looked at us like we had three heads. We asked again, and he pointed in some direction, saying, &quot;I think there's one down that way.&quot; This was not very helpful! But the staff was friendly enough and usually figured out what we were saying eventually. It's just something to prepare yourself for when checking in!Overall, it was a decent place to stay and I would certainly stay there again.	
+	Jun 4 2009 	Staying here feels like being at home	good location,economy hotel, friendly, helpful staff,clean, comfortable roomdelicious foodgood value	
+	Mar 24 2008 	Very Relaxing	A great hotel situated right by Hyde Park. I was a bit worried it might be noisy in the rooms due its location next to a busy roundabout, but decent double glazing kept any disruption out  I didnt hear a whisper. The buffet Breakfast was fantastic  all sorts of great food, with freshly made fruit smoothies, freshly cooked eggs, pastries and more. You can have breakfast in your room for the same cost, but I think youd be missing out.Its recently been renovated, so the rooms are top notch  big fluffy duvet, very comfy bed and nice B+O flat screen TV. The shower had a wonderful rain shower which was great too. If I was to have one negative it would have to be the size of the rooms  I had a Superior Room, which is one step up from the smallest room and it was a bit on the small side, especially the bathroom. However, London is blessed with much smaller rooms than this and its not as if they can make them any bigger! If you want a larger room youre going to need to pay for it. Staff were reasonably efficient  front desk and porters were welcoming and friendly, a little bit slow to offer coffee at breakfast, but otherwise good. Location is fine too  close to the tube, Buckingham Palace and the Parks. In summary, a very relaxing and nice hotel  I wish I could stay there more often.	
+	Jun 18 2007	Loved the hotel!	Had I known how great this hotel was beforehand, I would have stayed here my entire stay in London instead of changing hotels. Great service &amp; great room.	
+	Sep 24 2009 	pretty much ok geat location	We got a low price on priceline, so I think this hotel was ok. The lobby is beautiful, the elevators are tiny, and there are renovations going on in the hallways which are stinky and loud during the day. The first room we were given on the 3rd floor was tiny and outdated with a small double bed, and with no room for the crib we had requested. We called down to reception and they brought us a key to room 111, which has been renovated, had a king bed, and plenty of space. We were not asked to pay more for it. So, I think they did meet our needs without too much hassle. They did have the crib in the new room when we arrived. We did not use this hotel's services, since we were only there one night, but the location is really good, only 2 minutes walk from the St. James station, and very close to Westminster and Buckingham Palace. Overall, an ok place to stay.	
-	Sep 24 2006 	Not what I had hoped for	I got this hotel through Priceline for $95/night. Location is good, except that I stayed there on a Saturday, Sunday and Monday and the area was just about dead. The hotel is in a pretty good location and the Tube is right around the corner. Walking distance to a lot of the things you might go to London to see.The checkin and out was smooth, the staff was generally pretty helpful and I loved the Caxton Bar in the hotel. Went there every night and the main barman was as friendly and helpful as they get. Plenty of pubs around there were open, but not all of them. Must mostly be a business area and the weekends pretty much everything seemed to either be closed or had very short hours.The single major issue I had with the hotel was that I asked for and got, a non-smoking room but because the room didn't have air conditioning( and it was plenty warm ) I had to open the windows to get anything close to cool air. The problem became that at least every 30 minutes or so( until 2-3 in the morning) someone was outside, just below my window smoking, so it was like I WAS in a smoking room. Also, while every room on my floor had a no smoking sign on the door, there was a LOT of strong smoke odors in the hallways and especially around the elevators. And forget about the public areas of the hotel, smoke central.The room itself was clean and neat and had no smell of smoke at all, but that didn't mean it was pleasant. The one thing that helped was that I wasn't in the room often as I was off looking at the city, but trying to sleep was miserable.Now I admit that this might simply have been a case of bad luck, and were you to get a room in a different location or a different time of year, it might be an OK place to stay. But I won't stay there again.	
-	Jul 7 2006	Coldhearted Front Desk	Just returned from Trip to London and Paris. We arrived at the hotel at 11:30am. The front desk manager laughed at us and smirked saying &quot;didn't you know that the check-in time is 2:00pm !&quot;. He assured us there was nothing he could or would do. We slept in the chairs in the lobby exhausted from our red-eye flight. We were the only guests waiting in the lobby and did not dare ask that a room be cleaned and available before 2:00pm. As my children were hungry and a hamburger cost $18 at the hotel, I ran around the corner and bought 2 cups of chicken soup. When my children ate these in the lobby, the cold-hearted front desk manager asked a reluctant staff member to request my children to eat in the parking lot (the staff member apologized and stated that he was asked to do this). At 2:00pm when I checked in the manager acted as if I had just arrived even though he watched me wait for 150 minutes. Every day when we saw this particular front desk manager (younger, Italian fellow) he stared us down. Every item I put in the free security box was handled and scrutinized by this desk mmanager who laughed at each item I put in the box, particularly found my extra digital camera funny - I don't know why). At the end of our stay, as not to be screwed on our bill- problem other reviewers have cited), I spoke at length with an older front desk manager (apparently more senior than our arrogant friend). He apologized for the actions of the younger man but it seemed all too familiar to him. He stated he would have a serious word with the cold-hearted one but offered nothing further. On the positive side, the hotel was pretty clean and in a great location close to Buckingham Palace and St. James park and the Underground. I think this hotel is better suited for Italian visitors and businessmen. It's a tradeoff between these assets and a front desk staff that is heartless and arrogant (they could learn a lesson or two from the maids and other workers who were quiet friendly.) Also of note, I travel extensively and have never experience a concierge so reluctant to help with any questions. Luckily our Paris experience was quite the opposite!	
+	Aug 17 2004	We were pleased.	We stayed here on our last night through London. Wish we had booked this hotel on our first 2 nights through London; as we were very pleased!The room was a good size, clean and modern. We really liked this hotel.As far as location, we thought it was good; but I guess it depends on what you want to be close to.We really liked this hotel, as well as the staff &amp; decor. If we were to go to London again, we would certainly stay here again. In fact, when we plan our trip to Italy (someday...), I will be sure to check out the Jolly chain.	
+	Jan 5 2004	Great Location with a few quirks	I recently stayed at the Jolly Hotel St. Ermin's for six nights -- from December 27 through the New Year's Holiday. On the whole, our visit was very positive. You simply cannot beat the location -- a quick two-minute walk to St. James's Park tube station (Circle and District lines), about a 10-minute stroll to Victoria Station and easy access to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. Multiple sandwich shops can be found in the immediate neighborhood as well as a Sainsbury's on Victoria Street. Don't miss the National Trust Gift shop just down Caxton Street -- lovely items to take home. Also, the hotel is directly across the street from New Scotland Yard (with a policeman posted out front round-the-clock) which made us feel like we were in a safe location and provided a real &quot;cool&quot; factor for my 9 year-old son. Some quirky things about the hotel . . . The lifts have a maximum capacity of 5 people and there is frequently a queue for them -- particularly during the breakfast crush and following fire alarms (yes, there was an evening fire alarm during our stay). The desk staff may try to slot you into a continental breakfast even though you are clearly booked for a full breakfast. Be vigilant and stand your ground -- the very polite desk staff will make the necessary amends. When you first check into your room, don't unpack until you make sure the heat works properly -- if it doesn't, request another room. Our heat did not work reliably (which I discovered after everything was unpacked) and we suffered a few chilly nights before it was fixed. As noted by other reviewers, this is an Italian chain. The staff do a good job of communicating in English -- be prepared to work with them and all will be well. They are pleasant, friendly and fair. Also be aware that all printed material in the room is in Italian and only six of the television channels are in English. But, you're in London to enjoy the sights so don't worry about the television -- you get BBC 1 and 2 as well as Sky-TV. That's all you really need. Jolly St. Ermin's was a lovely place to stay and I hope to visit again soon.	
+	Aug 18 2009 	Great location clean hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights with our 12 and 15 year old children. There is no need for taxi's or a car, the C3 bus service is excellent to Earls Court or the 391 to Fulham Broadway, both have regular services and stop accross the road from the hotel. When the Imperial Wharf train station opens later this year, this hotel will be more appealing.Since reading some earlier reviews of the hotel I notice they have reduced their breakfast rate to £8.50 and £4.50 for the kids. Although our room was beside the lift we did not hear one sound coming from the corridor and we were facing the road, again not a sound at night. I would definitely recommend this hotel as a base in London, its not in the heart of the city but is in a lovely area.	
+	Oct 31 2005	Highly Recommend	This hotel was great value and quality for the cost. Highly recommend. Room was excellent  we had 1 double bed and 1 single bed. Bedspreads, blankets, pillows and sheets were very clean. In addition, bathroom was very clean too. Mattresses appeared to be newer as they were very comfortable. Halls were quiet at night, very relaxing. We did not wake up in time for the breakfast in the morning, so I can not comment on that. Bar in the lobby was great for a glass of wine before bed. A minor drawback for some travelers is its located a little bit away from the Tube stop  but it is easy to walk from the hotel (cute neighborhood and shops along the way  very safe) and you can get anywhere in London via the Tube.	
+	Oct 7 2007 	Comfortable stay at Jury's Islington	I stayed one night at the Jury's Inn Islington in October 2007 while attending a conference at the nearby Business Design Centre. My company travel agent arranged the booking on my behalf.I arrived about 7pm to find my room ready for me, and after a very quick check-in proceeded to the second floor where my room was at the end of the corridor. It was a comfortable room, with a small &quot;sofa&quot; (see photos) as well as the bed, table, TV, tea/coffee and the bathroom area. It doesn't quite compare with Marriott hotels I've stayed in at a similar rate in London, but there was certainly nothing wrong with the room decor, size etc. The bed wasn't quite king size, but that's not a problem for a single occupant.My one complaint about the stay was the noise created by plumbing in surrounding rooms. I woke at least two or three times during the night to hear pipes rattling above or below me, though in fairness I think I was always going to have a fairly restless sleep in any case. It wasn't anywhere near the level that would cause me to complain to the hotel or ask to move room etc.Breakfast was served in the restaurant area, and I found it well presented and very filling. It's self-service, and if you are to have a full English you are given a ticket at the desk to exchange with the person behind the desk at the cooked breakfast part of the buffet. The seating area is spacious and there was certainly no feeling of being rushed to leave, the way you sometimes are in Marriotts and elsewhere.Check-out was uneventful.Overall I'd recommend Jury's Inns, and I'd say I was very satisfied with my experience staying there. They aren't quite 5* deluxe hotels, but they're comfortable and will meet your needs for a quick stay away from home - or a longer stay when you're paying the bill for yourself!	
+	Sep 5 2005	excellent value	We stayed for 2 nights, great hotel,new and modern with nice rooms, good airconditioning.Breakfast was very good . We had a bar meal one night in the hotel pub which was nice and good value again. 5 mins walk to the angel tube station or the no 38 and 19 bus which takes you through to picadilly circus, takes about 15/20 mins.Would stay again and highly recomend this hotel.	
+	Oct 15 2009 	Great location and value.	We stayed for one week for sightseeing to the usual tourist places. Located near the Earl's Court tube station made getting to and from Heathrow very convenient and all other city trips were quite convenient as well.The room was small but well organized. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Staff and guests had a very European feel. Breakfast was great. The hotel got busier as the week progressed and so service suffered a bit. I would stay there again. Not only free high speed internet but several computers to use at no cost.	
+	May 12 2008 	Lovely Continental-style boutique hotel	We had two rooms - one double, one triple - and, despite all the reviews that warn of &quot;small rooms&quot;, I would think that only American visitors used to larger rooms might be disappointed. I found the rooms to be a very decent size; both of ours were spotless and overlooked the hotel's delightful garden (which we were able to enjoy on an unseasonably hot May weekend). For our purposes (attending an event at Earls Court), the venue couldn't have been more ideally located. But the K+K is a two-minute walk away from the tube station, which is serviced by the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines; it's a 10-minute journey to the West End, and would therefore also be ideally suited for tourists. I booked with hotels.com, but wish I'd booked directly with K+K - I would have received the same good rate plus had breakfast included. Three of us opted to treat ourselves to the hotel's breakfast in any case (the other two went to Starbucks around the corner) - and I can confirm it was as excellent as all the reviews suggest. I give the hotel top marks for all the following reasons: location, friendliness of staff, convenient onsite car park, ambience (it has a European feel to it), cleanliness, amenities (both in the rooms and the hotel itself). I can't think of anything negative, or even neutral, to say. Great hotel.	
+	Jul 1 2007 	Loved it - and so did the guests I needed to impress!!	Well, the hotel is GORGEOUS looking on the outside and has a beautiful lobby. Awesome free tea (I'm a big tea-swiller). Inside, it's ver VERY clean and the rooms are light and airy - very IKEA-ish in their furniture i.e. light wood and stylish - seems to be renewable resources e.g. bamboo. It's AIR-CONDITIONED. Anyone staying in Londond in sweltering heat knows how important that is. Passages leading to room are narrow but you don't live in the passages... rooms are BIG and bed is BIG and comfy. Breakfast is AWESOME. It's buffet and it's included - best selection I've seen anywhere outside the 6-star Zurich hotel. I'd say the breakfast alone makes it worth it. Museli, fresh fruit, bangers and mash, scrambled and poached eggs, cereal, milk, bread/jam/honey/cheese/butter and lots of fruit juice...It's hearty and tastes good. I have serious dust and smoke allergies - had NO problems at the hotel. Located next to Earl's court - which is a central hub.. so really great for touring or business. M&amp;S down the road... staff was very helpful and friendly. One glitch - they didn't have our room ready when we got there (flight was a little early)... so it was a bit of a wait. Frankly, some people who came after us seemed to get rooms before we did....we waited for one hour after check-out and still didn't get a room until a different desk-clerk arrived. It might have been a co-incidence but then again, who knows? Also, our bath mat (i.e. the rubber thing in the bathtub) disappeared after day 1 and never reappeared again despite repeated requests. Bath mat was a little important because I was travelling with elderly guests and they needed the traction. i WOULD stay at this hotel again - after making sure I remind the staff that last time I had to wait. For what you get out of staying there, I'd say it's the best hotel in London.	
+	Feb 2 2005	Wonderful Showers but too small room for a triple	We just returned from a stay at the K&amp;K George Hotel. Everything was very clean, the service was wonderful and the staff warm and friendly. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel because we found it quite pricey - we went up to Earl's Court to Benjy's where you get unlimited coffee and breakfast for around 4 pounds. The only major problem we had was we paid for and asked for a triple, and they gave us a room with two twin beds and a cot. We were traveling with a disabled person who needed assistance, so all three of us had to be in the same room. They just took out a table from a double room and added a cot! We checked out other rooms but they were all the same size or had smaller bathrooms. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend the K&amp;K - great location, showers had alot of water pressure, very clean - modern furniture, lobby, etc. They were also shooting a BBC TV program on the steet so that was very exciting too.	
+	Oct 12 2009 	This is a great London Hotel - highly recommended	Could not believe the size and overall comfort of the room. Has everything one needs, wi-fi, big flat screen, iron, tea &amp; coffee making, huge bathroom - list goes on. Needed to be in the area to meet family and had a added bonus of the new Westfield Centre across the road. Am not shopper but the area offers quality dining and bars. Great tube access on the central line.The rooms and service offered here is far superior to the poor value for money closer into town, so the little extra travel time into central London is a small price to pay. Am very pleased to have accidently stumbled across K West.	
-	Nov 9 2007 	This Hotel is the pits!	Last week, I stayed at the Kensington Close Hotel in London, as I was attending an exhibition at Olympia. Hotel was conveniently located - but that was it.I checked in and was originally given a single room, which was literally the size of a broom cupboard. I went back to reception to complain and was told they had no double rooms, but would upgrade me to an exec twin. on the 6th Floor.When I walked along the corridor, there was an overwhelming rotting/musty smell, which was coming from a large patch on the carpet which seemed to be rotting.When I got into the room, I was really shocked by the fact that the room was tatty and shabby. But was more concerned that the Bathroom was really dirty.Floor tiles were cracked and dirty. The toilet pan was cracked. The shower curtain, shower head and tiles were covered in orange mould - which suggested that the room had not been given a proper clean for sometime.From the website it claims to be a 4*, but I've never stayed anywhere quite so squalid. Do yourself a favour and dont' book this hotel - it's a rip off!	
-	Dec 19 2005	Terrible Experience/Room	Rooms are small and the hotel is big - so I felt like I was staying in a 1970's dorm room. I'm used to small Euro hotel rooms, but this was ridiculous. Worse yet, the service was terrible: they gave me the key to an unmade room &amp; I had to go down 6 flights to retrieve an available room; waited over 30 minutes to get two bottled waters from room service; they forgot my wake-up call (had morning appt tickets for Tower of London). I had a better room with far better service in a smaller, more charming hotel right down the street at Kensington Rooms. This hotel is CHARMLESS &amp; I was very unhappy with my stay here. I booked through Eurovacations &amp; thankfully, the Paris hotel I booked through them was wonderful.Only good aspects of this hotel is the nice Kensington neighborhood (albeit out of the way) and relative closeness to the Tube. Other than that, I suggest you book somewhere else!	
+	Jul 9 2005	What was all the negativity about?	Stayed in the hotel from June 23-28. We arrived early and after a small misunderstading about the name the room was under , Married or maiden, we were let into our room at 11 in the am, very nice after all night flight.We were very happy with the room, very good size by european size. We had a double and ny parents stayed at the same time and they had a single and also a good size.The room was clean the bathroom was a good size and while the lobby always seemed busy the hallways were always quite and we only saw 4 other people in the hallways the entire time. The location was great, right around the corner from the tube and lots off shops!!!!There was also a McDonalds right up the street:)	
+	May 31 2005 	It may be Kensington BUT...	Good rate (£ 47 including tax for a &quot;king size leisure&quot;), very disappointing guestroom - very dark, stuffy, old-fashioned - and terribly small bathroom. Staff OK, cleanliness OK-ish.Not a place I'd come back to if I can avoid it, even if the location is good: it's only a short walk from one of the underground stations and from the national museum of natural history. Workable internet cafe just across the road.	
-	Sep 21 2004	Do It Yourself 4 Star Hotel	Room was called a suite! Had a seating area with totally inadequate lighting - tiny fridge as a minibar - not plugged in. Lighting in bathroom also inadequate. Power shower fine if you like to cover everything in bathroom with water. Bath had no footmat or equivalent - v dangerous and slippery. Appalled to discover that &quot;breakfast is till 10&quot; means all food is removed at 10 - regardless of guests having finished eating or not. Cont. Breakfast very poor in choice. Breakfast gave a whole new meaning to self-service. Only knife and napkin on the table. Want a cup of tea? There's the hot water, there's the tea bag and the cup and saucer - do it yourself!4 star? I don't think so.

+	Jun 13 2003	Excellent Oasis in the Heart of Knightsbridge		
+	Jun 26 2005	Lancaster Hall Hotel	The Lancaster Hall Hotel is very conveniently located a short walk from Paddington station, both undergound and mainline trains, an even shorter walk to Bayswater Road where you can get a bus to Oxford Street, or walk a short distance to the Lancaster Gate underground station.It is affiliated with the German YMCA and has a Youth Wing attached to the Hotel. It is a great place to stay. I was booked into the Youth Wing as usual, but when I arrived at the Hotel I was upgraded to a hotel room and I had 11 nights there in June 2005. The rates for the Youth Wing are quite cheap, I would go as far as to say a stay in the Youth Wing would almost be the cheapest in London. You can have a very substantial breakfast whether staying in Hotel or Youth Wing as there is no distinction between guests staying in either as far as breakfast is concerned. The only difference between the Hotel and the Youth Wing is that in the Youth Wing you have to share showers and toilets, and there is no t.v. in the rooms, but if you are young you are probably out every night and wouldn't need a t.v!The service from the staff is extremely good and there is someone on reception 24 hours a day. I would recommend this Hotel, and the Youth Wing, to anyone wanting to stay in London. It is so conveniently located to so much transport and the West End. I have stayed here on a number of occasions on my various visits to London.Thank you to the staff at Lancaster Hall Hotel for making my stays in London so easy.Liz Noble	
+	Nov 11 2009 	Great location	Stayed 6 nights at the Lancaster London. Location was terrific - a few blocks from the Hethrow Express and right near the tube system. We had a great view of Kensington Park and the fireworks displays for Rememberance Sunday. Continental breakfast came with our package and was the same but always good, an upgrade to the English breakfast was available for L2 and worth it. A few blocks away there are some great pubs, restaurants and fish places to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner so don't confine yourself to the hotel - you can just go out and explore. Only complaint was the housekeeping staff seemed to think everyone was out of the room before l0am even on the weekends and we would have not one but two or more quick knocks and opening of our doors before we had a chance to respond. Guess we should have remembered to put the privacy sign out every evening before we went to bed. Also - watch out for the telephone charges - we asked and were given the price for &quot;local&quot; calls. We hadn't thought that a cell phone call in London wasn't considered &quot;local&quot; and the price was more then 3x per minute then was quoted. There are internet places a few blocks away so you don't need to pay the hotel internet fee either if you just want to check email. Nice place for a first trip to London but think there are more interesting places for a tourist to stay then with all the business types. Enjoy!	
+	Feb 22 2004	Very good hotel		
+	Oct 28 2008 	helpfull staff	We had an enjoyable one night stay to see a show.Although the room was small, it was clean and adequate.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and all were very friendly. The position is close to the tube and parking at a nearby supermarket is convenient ( £10.50). Breakfast was good and served till 9.30. We would certainly return.	
+	Apr 22 2008 	excellent servicehigh standard	From the first approach till check out I had a very positive opinion about the Hotel.reception is well organised,helpful,kind,rooms are absolutely spotless,nicely refurbished.We had a quite spacious room comparing to other hotel rooms in London.The location is perfect,10 minutes from centre,but still nice residental area.I recommend it to all who are planning to travel to London,and wants to get a high standard for their money.	
+	Feb 18 2007	a outstanding experience	I stayed at the Le Meridien Piccadilly for three nights in december 2006 just before Christmas. Because my flight was delayed I arrived really late in the evening at about 11.30 p.m. The staff member at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel facade and lobby were beautifly decorated and athmosphere was wonderful. I got a deluxe room on the second floor overlooking Regent street. The room was absolutely beautiful very much like the one posted on the official Le Meridien webpage. It was spacious, it had about 40 square metres and ceeling was about 4 meters high, the style of the design was edwardian, simple classic luxury. The bathroom was also extremely nice. Every morning I experienced a wonderful breakfast in the Terrace restaurant, which overlooks Piccadilly. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially those in the restaurant. The food was exquisite. There were about fifteen tipes of smoked salmon, twenty tipes of tropical fruit, fiftteen tipes of Fortnum &amp; Mason marmelade, a range of freshly baked breads, bagels, about ten different kinds of cereal, ex. For me the hotel appeared absolutely outstanding. I also got the chance to read some of the reviews on this site and one caught my interest. The man who wrote it also added some candid pictures of an absolutely pathetic little room. I cant imagine what I would have done if I got a room like that. I believe that the amount of money that you pay per room in this hotel should be over 400$. The room I stayed in was worth slightly more than that. I dont know how much that gentleman payed for his room but he couldn't have payed more than 250$. All in all my experience was simply fantastic. If I were to go in London again I would deffinetely stay at the Le Meridien Piccadilly because it is one of the top luxury hotels in London.	
-	Nov 12 2005	Hotel is nice but..........	Just returned today after staying at Le Meridien from the 5th-12th of November. After reading the mixed reviews I was a little concerned but since it was already booked and paid for, I went with an open mind. First problem arose when I checked in. American Airlines Vacations booked me into a Junior Suite, which is what I had paid for, Le Meridien had me in a regular room and would not move me. When I showed the desk clerk the information from AA Vacations showing the description as a Junior suite with separate bedroom, 2 televisions..etc, I was informed that by the desk clerk that AA made the mistake, not them and to take it up with AA when I returned home. Prior to leaving for London I looked for a ticketing office address in London in case of problems while vacationing and the address listed by AA on their website for a ticket office, no longer existed, so I'll call AA Vacations on Monday and ask for a refund between the regular room I was given and the Junior Suite I paid for.The staff(not those at the front desk) were accomodating and very helpful with questions and directions. The Concierge and bell staff were very friendly as well as the Doorman. Room was worn out, couldn't get a newly renovated one as there were no non-smoking ones available. The chairs and carpeting were really worn, to the point of fabric missing. The mini bar didn't work so I had to have room service deliver ice daily. The room service staff told me that the refrigerators were leaking in some rooms and they were turned off. My room faced Regent Street and having read prior reviews I was aware of the noise issue, and it was noisy especially late at night and into the wee hours of the morning. It wasn't people noise, it was bus and car noise. After a few days, you just adjusted to it. The room was very hot, even with the heat turned off. I was lucky that one window could be opened and the room cooled off within 20-25 minutes.My room rate included the English breakfast, ate there once and that was enough. I can't believe they actually charge people £22 a person for that breakfast, it was horrible. The eggs and the bacon were not cooked at all, the waffles and pancakes had a grainy texture. The best thing about this hotel is it's location. You are within walking distance to everything and the Hop On/Hop Off bus pick up is in Piccadilly Circus. The theatres are all within a 5 minute walk as is Leicester Square. There are numerous eateries and pubs within a few minute walk. It was wonderful in that respect. There is a Tesco Market about 1/2 block away on Lower Regent Street. Starbucks is a few doors down as well as a Cafe Nero and a Garfunkels Diner across the street.Would I stay at Le Meridien again? No, I can honestly say that the price they are charging is just too expensive for what you are getting. It's great location wise, but that's about it.	
+	Jul 15 2007 	Ana (Portugal)	Do the pictures on the web site don't reflecte the bedroom we staid in, you have fresh towels and a clean room every day. the staff is ok, always at your disposal. after knowing the city (expensive!) it is a good offer for the price we paid.	
+	Jul 2 2005 	lily good		
+	Jan 28 2009 	croatia	me and 3 of my friends stayed at this hotel for 7 nights. we booked the room through venere.com. we got a great price with a discount and each of us payed 150euro for a week. it was even cheeper than on the hotel web site. i expected less, but we got a clean, renovated room with a fridge and our own bathroom. the breakfast was continental but a good start of every morning. the recepcionist was a really nice guy. the location of a hotel was great, 2 min walk from paddington station, and few more from hyde park. near the hotel there are few pubs, kfc, burger king and shops. the neighbourhood was guiet and pleasent. i think this hotel represents a good value for money. i think i will come this year again, but with my bf. i am looking forward to it!!!a+a+j+m	
+	Aug 6 2009 	Great way to enjoy a stay in London	We've been staying at the London Bridge Hotel for our last three visits to London, and the quality and comfort never changes -- always wonderful. A small boutique hotel in a part of London that's less crowded but near the sites. Have a train and underground station near buy is so convenient, and being almost on the Thames Walk, you can get to lots of sites without having to walk the busy streets. Near to Borough Market, the Globe, Tower of London, an easy walk to London Eye and Westminster. Breakfasts are generous and delicious, and staff and concierge are always extremely helpful and welcoming. We won't stay anywhere else when we go to London.	
+	Dec 21 2007 	Great value for money	Room not ready when we arrived so left our bags and when we returned we had been upgraded to a family apartment. It was huge, separate sitting room, dining room and large kitchen It had two bebrooms with very comfy beds and a 50&quot; television. Breakfast was good, they kept running out of things but they were soon replaced.Location was about two tube rides away for anywhere central but the tube station was just around the corner.All in all great hotel with friendly service, would definitely use again, great value for money.	
-	Apr 25 2009 	if you like very long elevator waits stay here	the hotel, which is lovely, has introduced a new elevator system that means you often have to wait ten or so minutes to simply get to the appropriate one. Even staff is exasperated about the &quot;smart&quot; system. You punch the floor you want to go outside the elevator and it assigns you a specific elevator. If another elevator comes first, even if it is empty, you can't board because you can't press the floor inside of the elevator. Stuck!	
-	Oct 4 2006 	Decent hotel ovepriced busienss facility not friendly to Americans	I used mileage to stay at this property in early September.The halls and lobby were dirty. The front desk personnel were very rude and disinterested. Business center was twice the price of other Hiltons in London. Internet was slower than old dial up connections.Overall, a big disappointment to beginning of our homneymoon.

+	Oct 23 2007 	Two very satisfied tourists	My friend and I stayed at the London Lodge Hotel for a week in late September, early October 2007 and we both loved it. The street it's on is charming and quiet, and reminded us of a set from My Fair Lady! From when we checked in, every member of the staff we encountered was kind and helpful. Since we were staying more than a few days it was good to be in a place run by a manager who clearly cares about her guests and is around to make sure everything is fine. I knew that single rooms in London are small with single beds, which ours were, but they were comfortable, attractive, clean, and quite adequate with fine beds and nice bathrooms. There was even a teddy bear waiting on the bed to keep you company during your stay! When we decided to switch rooms after the first night the staff did it for us with no problems at all. I decided I wanted the stand up shower while my friend preferred the bathtub. If you have a preference it's worth it to ask. The breakfast was good, and though we never had a chance to have dinner there, the menu looked worthwhile, and we liked knowing there was a restaurant for dinner if we needed it. On the mantelpiece in the lobby there are even books you can borrow. It seems they've thought of everything. I guess what I liked best was the friendly, personal touch.The hotel is off Earl's Court Road, and near the Kensington High Street, so there are plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby, but when we got back in the evening tired from touring, the nearest tube station at Earl's Court seemed a longer walk than in the morning. We did wish it had been a bit closer, but that's the only criticism we had. All in all, a lovely place.	
+	Aug 29 2009 	Gutes Hotel - Schöner Urlaub		
+	Dec 3 2008 	Une très bonne adresse à Londres!		
+	Jun 23 2009 	clean hotel and very friendly staff	Great hotel. Our room (#820) was large (for European standards) enough for 2 adults and 2 kids. Smallish bathroom but it works. Very friendly staff, too expensive hotel breakfast buffet. Nice pool and workout facility. Close to Marble Arch Tube stop ( approx. 6 blocks away) Close to Oxford street, Hyde park (Speaker's Corner), Kensington, short ride to Notting Hill - Portobello RD. Very diverse area (Lebanese, Iranian) and for me it was not conducive to enjoying a tea at a cafe nearby due to Hookka smoke. Felt safe and very satisfied. If I could get a hotel for the same price and amenities in London's main Square mile, I would but we were very happy. Newly remodeled.	
+	May 28 2007 	A Safe Bet for Young Families	Okay so it isn't at Marble Arch but this hotel is pretty central and a good choice, especially for families. As for any negative comments about being in an Arab area? Well, this is London - it's multi-cultural and never a problem. It isn't Baghdad!Anyway, back to the hotel. We stayed for two nights with our children aged 9 and 4 and were made very welcome. Our room was a king sized double with a fold-down sofa bed. We would have preferred two queen beds but it was fine. The room was spotless and the service exemplary with nice touches such as balloons for the kids as they waited at check-in.The pool is good but not brilliant. It's a little small with limited changing facilitites but fine.Gripes? Only the fact that we were continually told that we would have to pay for our eldest child's breakfast, despite the fact that our rate stated that we were entitled to free kids' breakfasts for children under 12. Fortunately, I had printed off the rate description (&quot;Escape Family Time&quot; or something like that) but was a little annoyed that I kept having to produce the print out! As compensation, the breakfasts - as noted before - are above average with good choice, quality ingredients and efficient service.As I say, it is fairly central. We walked to Regent's Street in around 30 minutes with the kids but cabs to Covent Garden should cost around £12.The staff are worthy of mention, particularly the concierge and maitre d at breakfast. All in all, not five star but a solid four star choice which is especially good for families.	
+	Jun 23 2008 	Not really Regents Park.....	We stayed at this hotel to attend an event in Regents Park.The main complaint I would have is that this hotel is nowhere near anything (including regents park), it is basically in a very residential area with very limited taxis....However ignoring the location the hotel was OK... it could be any other Marriott anywhere in the world. The bed was comfy, the room was average size (for London), the buffet breakfast was fairly well catered for...Overall, a good hotel if you do not want to be near any of Londons major attractions	
+	Jan 27 2006	Loved it.	My family and I stayed here in August, and we all enjoyed it. The service was excellent, esp the bell man, I don't know his name, but he was quite cheery. The rooms were clean and modern. It was a nice change, compared to the dump we stayed in Torquay the previous two nights. I enjoyed the fact that this place had balconies. A big plus. I am a smoker, but I don't like smoking in the same room as my son, so it was nice to stand out there instead of running down to the hotel lobby and outside, like the other places we stayed. The only thing, I didn't like was the beds, the mattresses were too soft, but that wouldn't stop me coming here. As long as I didn't have sleep in them for too long. I know it was out of the way, but I much rather stay here, than go to one of those awful budget tourist hotels closer to the attractions, which my husband and I did once years ago. Terrible. We also got a good deal over the net when we booked, and it was one of the cheaper places we stayed at, during our England trip. I would stay here again in a flash.	
+	Aug 31 2009 	great location	from the moment we arrived the girls on reception were fantastic with my little boy,great location 5 min walk to london bridge tube or monument tube station, breakfast was great plenty of choice we were here for the rugby and it was a direct link to wembley from london bridge which was great.Bourough market is a must seedefo stay again when we come for the football, a big thank you to all staff.	
+	Sep 16 2009 	Very accomodating	We ended up at this hotel by mistake due to an issue at the original hotel we had booked but it was great, we actually wanted to stay here for the rest of our stay but they were unforyunatley fully booked for the rest of our duration :-(The staff were great, they offered us plenty of advise on places to go and things to see plus organised various tickets for us at concessionary rates which were a bargain compared to the prices we would have had to pay on the door, plus they were fast track tickets too so no waiting around in que's which was fab too!!Breakfast was good, variety of fruit and pastry's, i have a sweet tooth so I would go for the sweet stuff first ;-)Compared to the other hotel e had to go back to which was apprently a brand new hotel, this hotel was way better, there rooms are quite small but compared to where we had to stay for the rest of our time away, the rooms were more than accomodating and comfortable, beds were well cosy.If you have to choose between the Trebovir and the this hotel, my advise would be to pick this one, it may look a bit cheaper online but the only differnce is that this hotel's rooms are substaianlly bigger but have no a/c and some do not have flat screen tv's either, which aint not biggy really.These guys pride themselves on cleanliness it seems like too, as the hotel has a very nice lemony aroma to it and the cleaning staff are well friendly, where as the the Trebovir smells of dampness.I would certainly reccomned this hotel to anyone that's on a budget and wants to visit London, as its cheaper than most uptown hotels but has the same standards as most of the upmarket hotel's if not more.I must add that from reviewing there rack rate's, they were cheaper than the Trebovir too, it's a shame i missed them while searching for a hotel :-(The hotel next door looked good from the outside too, I beleive it was called the mayflower, but looks can be deceiving and from readin there reviews, it seems a bit hit miss or maybe.	
+	Oct 15 2008 	Very Efficient staff	I recently stayed at this hotel with my family. The staff at this hotel especially the front desk staff and the housekeeping staff deserve a special mention. They are friendly, energetic and super efficient. They organised our sight seeing tours, transportation, theatre shows and also reccomended some delicious restaurants and area's which we visited as a family and had a great time.The Manager organised for Me and my Brother to accompany him on a night out on the town and he sure know's how to show us out of towner's a good time!!! Thanks for that boss. There is a casino near by which we went to and then moved onto Leicester square which was only about a 10 minute ride on the tube, as the Manager had to get back to the hotel early, he showed us a few nice places and also organised for a taxi to pick us up after, as the tube does not run after midnight. The hotel decor is pretty although the size of the room was a little dissapointing. Breakfast was plain and simple, all the essentials to get you started for the day including fresh fruit, was quite surprised when I saw kiwi's in the buffet area, haven't eaten one of them in ages but had quite a few while staying here, pleasent change to my usualy daily fry ups ;-)Overall it is a very comfortable hotel and the friendly and smiling staff make it worth the stay.	
+	Feb 1 2006	Great for me!...	Really lovely, warm, cosy single room - perfect for my overnight stay as I was travelling alone. Booked over the internet with ease, and efficient &amp; friendly service from staff at reception. Room and en-suite bathroom were both very clean and tidy, room also had TV, telephone &amp; hairdryer. New bed linen &amp; towels were provided. Will definitely book here again. Easy to get to - only a 5-minute walk from 24-hour bus service into London's West End/Oxford Street (buses are every 8-15 mins throughout the day). Highly recommended.	
+	Oct 11 2009 	Friendly family hotel	Very friendly comfortable place to stay, located close to Victoria Station with Bus service Number 24 outside the hotel. Room was very clean, small with 2 single beds and not much room for anything else, but enough for a week stay in London. Great breakfast served downstairs and service was unbelievable. Highly recommend this hotel.	
+	Nov 15 2008 	Great location	Was really pleased with the price of this hotel considering the location (5 mins walk from Pimlico tube, 10 mins from Victoria). Great to find an English breakfast included for a change, unlike the previous hotel nearby where we got cold croissants, biscuits and long life yoghurts! Room wasn't massive, but plenty big enough and really clean. Hade to queue for breakfast on second day, but wasn't too much hassle and staff were very attentive. Friendly, family run hotel which I would reccommend to anyone.	
+	Apr 6 2009 	Mal Life is pretty good!	I was lucky enough to win a prize of two night's dinner, B&amp;B in any Malmaison - I chose London. The hotel is in a quiet location yet really easy to get to and minutes on the tube from theatres, museums, shopping and all that London can offer. The staff at reception were helpful and friendly - with one exception. The staff in the Brasserie were attentive, relaxed, friendly and very efficient. The food in the Brasserie was also of a very high standard. Our room was on the 6th floor at the back - quiet, very clean, very comfortable. This has to be the best hotel I have stayed in and the subtle, homely but stylish ambience was unexpected in a London hotel. Yes I won this as a prize but I enjoyed Mal life so much, I plan to go back for more!	
+	Feb 5 2007 	Great hotel!	I stayed at the Malmaison in London for one night in January 2007. I wasn't sure what to expect having already stayed at Malmaison in Newcastle, Manchester and Leeds and reading reviews that implied that London might not live up to the others - I was very pleasantly surprised!The hotel is in a quiet, picturesque square within a short taxi-ride or one tube stop from Kings Cross station.The room was of a standard London hotel size and still seemed new - there was none of the wear and tear that there now is in some of the other Malmaisons. The bathroom wasn't huge but was well equipped and felt very contemporary. We had a problem with our toilet flushing continuously but we rang the front desk and within 20 minutes this had been sorted.The entrance lobby is quite dramatic and doubles as a champagne bar, whilst the decor of the rooms is just like all other Malmaisons - very modern and stylish.All the staff we met were extremely pleasant - the guy who fixed our toilet was also serving breakfast the next morning and he was extremely friendly and efficient. The food was also good - we had a room service snack late at night and then the full breakfast the next morning and both were great. We also drank in the bar on the lower ground floor until late and found that to be really atmospheric and cosy.Incidentally we found the bed extremely comfortable, unlike some of the other reviewers on here - I guess it all depends on personal taste!All in all we thought it was excellent value for money in London and would definitely stay there again next time we visit.	
+	Jan 4 2008 	The Lovely Mandeville...	Great hotel if you are looking for clean, classy accommodation with a funky edge... and with a location which is hard to beat; a good selection of restaurants and the shops of Oxford, Bond and Regent Streets are just a stones throw away. The hotel bar is definitely worth a visit and we were greeted by very friendly, knowledgeable staff... a pleasant change from some other hotels in the boutique category. Upgrade to a deluxe room for a super bathroom with a walk in shower and a separate bath.I am already planning a return trip in the Spring.	
+	Jun 7 2006	gem of a hotel	we stayed at the mandeville for a couple of nights in may, booking through lastminute. The location was a bonus, off the track but near enough to the crowds if you want them. There are plenty of wine bars and nice restaurants within a 5 min stroll too. The staff are friendly, helpful and always acknowledge you. Breakfast was good and the bar pretty impressive. The room was average size for london, but the decor was classy and plush, the bathroom modern and spotless. I really enjoyed my stay here and would definately return, it represents excellent value for money for this boutique hotel that is without attitude.	
+	Jan 23 2005	Favourite London Hotel	We travel to London every year for Christmas shopping and this year we tried the Mandeville Hotel. I had read the different reviews and was hoping for a room in the &quot; new section &quot; and I was certainly not disappointed. The room was beautifully furnished with every amenity that we personally required , yes a little small but this is London and with so much to see and do we do not spend a great deal of time in our room. Although there was building work taking place during our stay we were not disturbed by noise at all , just a little diversion here and there on entering and leaving. I think therefore that all rooms will be renovated very soon.Each and every member of staff whom we encountered was exceptionally friendly and courteous . Location excellent for shopping, we will certainly be returning in the future .	
+	Jun 8 2007	Simply The Best!!!!!	I always use Trip Advisor before booking anything [some might say i'm rather fussy!!] but after reading the one bad comment and two good comments, i asked them about teh bad points the Australian guy mentions ie no concierge [which they have], check in time of 9am [which is actually 10:30] and poor service [they offered to show me around the apartments to put my mind at rest. As i wasn't in London i said that I was unable to, but the fact that they offered meant alot. I checked in with no problems, they give you clear and concise directions and the apartment was stunning. Although they provide a weekly maid service, i asked if they could come in twice a week , which they said they could, and was pleasantly surprised by the price!! At all stages of my booking and stay i have to say, i found Marlin to be exceptional, i travel alot and rarely find a company like this, that really will go the extra mile to make your stay great. Even when i needed to extend, they did this withut fuss or hassle. Final word - if you are picky and want a great apartment coupled with superb customer service - use Marlin!!!!!!!	
-	Oct 2 2009 	DISAPPOINTING!	I stayed at the Marriott County Hall as part of my 21st Birthday weekend, I was extremely disappointed! The receptionist was very very rude and unhelpful.QUOTES &quot; you may leave your bags at your own perril&quot; and shouted across the reception at me in front of many other people stayng at the hotel &quot;If you do not pay for the room in full you will be evicted out of the room at 6pm sharp!&quot; this was after I refused to pay the full amount for the room without seeing it first. This was an upsetting start to what was meant to be a memorable weekend but the cherry on the top was that after a bath before my party i wished to relax in a dressing gown with my friends only to discover the gowns were FILTHY! complete with hair and neck dirt the gowns were yellow at the armpits! Most disgusting and over all a horrific stay.	
+	Sep 2 2009 	Fabulous hotel!	Loved everything about the hotel. Great food, drinks and in the heart London. Excellent gym.	
+	Jan 19 2008 	Terrific hotel and Great Location	I visited friends in the UK and stayed for a week at this hotel during the VERY fesrive month of December 2007 in London. First of all, pleae let me recommend London during the Christmas season. It's cold and windy but often December is dry with sunny days. It did not rain a drop the entire week I was there and I had been told by my friends that December is often like that. Additionally, the city is all lit up for Christmas and is one of the most festive places to be during the holidays. Airfares are lower as are hotel rates. The $550 US that I paid per night still isn't as high as this hotel will go for during the summer high season when crowds and prices, and the weather of rain are all at their worst. As is clear, the hotel is in a perfect location for leisure travel to London. A person can take the Tube from Heathrow and use the lift at Westminster Station with luggage to head across the bridge to the hotel. I had a $95 week-long London transit pass for unlimited Tube and bus use that included the Tube all the way to Heathrow. This does not include the Heathrow Express train so it took between 45 min and 1 hour for the one way trip but free as part of the pass is a great price! The pass can be obtained through Rail Europe before departure. I arrived at the hotel 8am expecting to have to lock up my luggage in the lobby, tour the city, and return later in the day to check in. However, the hotel was terrific and got me in a nice king room overlooking the Thames River and the London Eye. I was able to shower and change. The housekeeping staff had obviously been working hard early that morning to get some rooms ready for people like me arriving in the city on international flights. To be able to get settled and feel welcome like that, including having a housekeeping supervisor stop by my room two minutes after I walked in to make sure everything was OK, got my stay at the Marriott off to a great start. It was appreciated. I forced myself to stay awake all day which is key to adjust to the time change right away. Don't go to bed! Schedule some interesting touring to motivate yourself to go all the way until at least early-mid evening that night before crashing for a great night's sleep.The room was incredibly clean and well appointed. The bathroom is good sized and the room, though not as big as one might find in an American Marriott, was certainly not small. The tea service and electric kettle with coffee and hot chocolate were great for a warm up at the end of the cold day. The bed was very comfortable. The only downsides to the room amenities were the TV service was very limited, about 10-15 channels (not that you're going to want to stay inside and watch TV in the awesome city of London but still, when you do turn it on, it would be nice to have a little more choice), and in my room, the shower head which was messed up in just having a ton of water fall down with no ability to adjust it. It worked though and a person was able to take a shower without any problem. A light burned out in the room and though I filled out a repair card and left it on the door, it was never fixed during my week long stay. I also noticed that my laptop had been used and found that the last vistied site was Facebook which led me to think that housekeeping had used my Internet connection in the room to send an e-mail to a pal on Facebook as I don't use the service. Those four things are why I can't give the hotel a five rating rather than the four rating I give it. Front desk staff were always very quick to help and they took care of business perfectly, helping me cash cheques, and they got a request for a rollaway for a friend of mine staying two nights with me correct with no reminder.The gym is terrific. Becuase it's not just a hotel gym but for the locals too as a membership club, the equiipment and size of the place are all outstanding, as are the facilities such as steamrooms and saunas. There's also a lap pool. Use is free to guests. The whirlpool looked very nice but with a lack of force in the jets and not being more than 101 or so when it should have been 104 degrees, it wasn't of all that much use to me. Afternoon tea is terrific and with view of Parliament out the windows, is one of the best in London, and worth the price, which is still a lot less than you would pay at the Savoy or Ritz for tea. Other meals I had outside the hotel. For example, a standard breakfast from room service would be $40 yet across the street there's a Bagel Street where you can get a great latte and bagel with trimmings for about $10-$11. Yes, that's still a lot for two items like that in most US cities but we're talking London--a city with New York prices AND a tough exchange rate with the dollar. So, I suggest heading across to the bagel place for b-fast or three blocks away to Waterloo Station where there are a few b-fast places. There is also a coffee place across Westminster Bridge right across from St. Stephen's Tower (Big Ben) and beyond that on Whitehall there's the Red Lion Pub which serves breakfast and is a terrific place for beers in the downstairs pub or dinner in the upstairs dining room. All these places I've just mentioned are within a 5-10 minute walk of the Marriott. so there's no reason to pay top dollar for something like b-fast at the hotel. There's even a McDonalds right at the hotel but it seems a waste to be in London and eat in a McDonalds. The other food tips I will offer here are to eat at pubs all over the city, head to Indian and pasta places as well as sandwich places. Though the hotel might be really expensive (and worth it for the terrific location, comfort, and service), with a transit pass and all those less expensive places to eat, there's no reason why you can't stay in luxury yet not break the bank when it comes to transportation and food. As for that great location of the hotel, not only is it within a short walking distance of major sites, but it's just three blocks as I mentioned from Waterloo Station. Charing Cross Station is just a 15 minute walk. This puts train stations with day trip possibilities such as Hampton Court, Canterbury, and Windsor all within a short walk from the hotel. In addition to having Parliament just over the bridge, if you walk east down the river just a short distance, there's a bridget that takes you to Charing Cross, Trafalgar Square, and Covent Garden all in 10-15 minutes walking from the hotel with great views. The London Eye is right outside. Housekeeping did make some door shutting noise in the morning so don't plan on sleeping in much past 8 or 9am in this hotel. That worked for me because of all the touring I was doing and hanging out with my friends. The hotel showed itself willing to go the extra mile for guests by brining in a choral group on several nights to sing Christmas carols by the tree in the lobby. They also served hot mulled wine and cookies. One night a US Marine who had lost both his legs in Iraq and his wife joined us in sitting there to listen to the group sing. It was a special part of the trip that would not have been possible without the hotel spending some money and time to enhance our stay. Though it's big with hundreds of room and long hallways, the place has a European feel to it so don't think you're not going to get a London experience becauuse it's a Marriott. It's dark wood and other European touches all over the place. As a frequent Marriott stayer, I found the combination of European charm and Marriott dependability to be a great combination. I highly recommend this hotel for a visit to London. It's worth the extra money and like I said, get a transit pass and take advantage of the diversity of food choice in the city and you will hopefully be able to eoconomize elsewhere in this expensive but incredible city. And where else can you step outside your hotel and hear the bongs of Big Ben? This is my home base in London from now on.	
+	Jul 13 2004	Great Location - Big Rooms	Really liked the hotel - the rooms were huge. Stayed there on Marriott points, so it cost an extra 40 pounds / night to upgrade to a river view with access to the exec lounge (free evening cocktails and breakfast). Decided that it wasn't really worth the extra money, so I downgraded to a regular room. It was further from the elevator (FYI - there's only one set of elevators, so if you're in room 401, you're at the far end), but it was just as nice if not nicer, and still had a good view. The staff was very nice all around. Great location as well. Found it easier to take the tube to Westminster than to Waterloo station. Seemed to me that it was a faster walk to the hotel from Westminster. FYI - Starbucks is located on the street behind the hotel, as is an Internet cafe (1 pound / 30 minutes).	
-	Sep 25 2007 	Just Ok...but awesome location!	I stayed here for 4 nights using points. I'm glad I didn't pay retail which was over 200 pounds per night. The conversion to US would be over $400 per night. For this hotel...that would be a huge waste of money. The hotel location is terrific. We were able to take a cab to Harrods that was around 7 pounds. We could have walked it in about 20-25 minutes. We did walk to other shopping and Picadilly Circus with ease...if you're a walker...it's easy. If you're not...these things were close enough and cab would be give or take 10 pounds. The lhotel LOCATION reminded me of being in Beverly Hills. There were exotic cars and people with drivers all over the place. The shopping in the area is also very high end and it's in a very good part of town...very clean and quiet.The hotel was OK by Marriott Standards. The lobby was remodeled...that was nice. Our room was nice but not any nicer then some newer Marriott properties here in the US. Again, it wasn't awful...it was just &quot;fine.&quot; The room had a king bed, desk, armoire with the TV and a bathroom which was not that large...but well appointed with granite on the walls. Very nice looking. The room had all the necessary amenites too. One of the highlites after 3 weeks in Europe...this hotel had the best Air Conditioning around. Our room was always freezing. This hotel also has a &quot;Executive Lounge&quot; and I used that with my Marriott Membership. It was just like in the US except nothing hot for breakfast and no small bottles of water to take back to your room. The concierge leaves little to be desired. We asked for help twice. We wanted to eat at Nobu for sushi which is a short walk. He had the phone number memorized...which was great...however the directions he wrote down for us to walk there were about 3 blocks off. The second time he gave us info that was OK but his attitude is that we were bothering him. The front desk staff was fine too.Ultimately, the location is great, the hotel was spotless clean, everything worked and there were not major issues. However, I'm glad I used points instead of paying so much for a hotel that was like several other hotels in the US. I know London is expensive....I guess I just expected more.	
+	Jul 27 2006 	I couldn't fault this hotel!	I have just returned from a week long trip to London and i was lucky enough to have stayed at the beautiful Marriott hotel Grosvenor Square for the first time. Everything from arrival to departure was brilliant and the staff were so courteous and attentive. I was in London for meetings and some shopping, and was amazed by the closeness to Bond street tube station meaning that i could get to my meeting in the city easily and also walk to Selfridges my favourite london department store (about 3 miutes away!!!!!..... however with everything so close by the hotel was peacful and felt like 'one of those family run' hotels where everybody seems to knows your name!!!! There are two restaurants, one really swanky and another which is more geared towards hotel guests - i enjoyed the views and the food was great, again the staff were always attentive and very helpful. My room was large and was very funky with a great bed.I will definately use this hotel again, highly recommend!	
+	Dec 2 2004	Really nice place....	This was a really nice place to stay and definitely a cut above most Marriott hotels. The location in Mayfair can't be beat. The front desk people and concierge were all very helpful. The rooms were a bit small but the fact that they were renovated and had marble baths made up for it. The breakfast served in the small dining room, although expensive, was exceptionally good. I would definitely come back to this hotel again.	
-	Feb 20 2009 	Terrible housekeeping!	Having stayed at this hotel on several occasions we have never had any major problems (except from the neighbourhood, which is borderline bad). However, when we stayed a few days ago, it was the first time it was busy at the hotel and what a difference that made....The hotel room was poorly cleaned, the sheets were bloodstained(!) and housekeeping banged on the door at 09:15am in the morning wanting to come in and clean?! When I said we were sleeping, they had the audacity to ask when they could get in/come back... Well, my answer was After we have checked out today! When calling front desk to complain, they told me we should have hung out the do not disturb sign... OK, we could have done that if there actually would have been a sign in the room (which it was not..) but the reality is that the hotel should be organised enough to know who are checking out and NOT wake you up by banging on your door early morning wanting to come in a clean!We will NOT go back there	
-	Jan 13 2004	Marriott Maida Vale: awful check out bring with you confirmation of rates		
-	Nov 8 2009 	Avoid like the plague..or you could catch it !!	Two of us booked a weekend stay here but went home early.We had been conned by the website and a glowing review from Conde Nast..The policy is to pay on check in with no chance of a refund.The room allocated was tiny,noisy and filthy.On complaining we were told that there was no other room available,but that we could &quot;upgrade&quot; the second nightfor a further £20.We actually booked the nearby Premier Inn instead on the first night,which was excellent and we will use it in future.The secnd room was marginally bigger than the first with a minute bathroom with hardly enough room to sit down,and was also grubby.Having been out shopping we deicided to go staight home and not stay the second night..On phoning up since we have been hung up on twice......DON'T GO THERE !!!!	
+	Jul 13 2007 	lush bathroom	Stayed at the Mayflower Hotel for the first time for 2 nights earlier this month after booking it via the hotel reception direct. It was £99.00 p room p night with breakfast which was quite reasonable given the location and decor of the hotel. The interior was of a very high standard but I had entered the reception area before and it appeared a lot smaller this time as if they have put a room of some sort behind the reception area. The staff were very friendly and accommadating and always had a smile which for London is RARE!! We were told our room was ready and on the third floor so we waited (&amp; waited) for the very small lift to take us and our luggage up the stairs. The lift is tiny!! Our room was very pleasant with nice &amp; clean decor with two windows facing the main road. There are a few bars/clubs nearby but the noise was tollerable really and you have to expect noise in the middle of London. The shower was very spacious and the bathrooms nice and clean with lovely tiles. Our tv didnt work so all we had for a bit of entertainment was a crackly radio on the teasmade machine but Im not really one for staying in watching the telly anyway!!! Other negative would be the lack of love shown to the rear courtyard/patio area which was looking very sad and some of the plants had died. The courtyard could have been a lovely feature of the hotel. I peered over the fence of the next building and noticed that it had a very grand landscaped garden which then made the hotel's look a lot worse. The breakfast room was very pleasant with lots of cerials, rolls, toast &amp; juices. The cooked breakfast is extra, which is fair enough. We were going to The Ivy for lunch anyway so we didnt want too much at breakfast. On check out the staff once again were very friendly and let us leave our bags there whilst we went and did a bit more shopping. So overall this hotel is very handy and Ive walked past it in the past &amp; often thought about staying and now I have. I would stay again for sure.	
+	Oct 5 2009 	Great rooms great location (for this part of London)	I stayed in a triple room with my parents (in their 70s) for one night and found this hotel great. My bed was a fold down one which appeared out of one of the wardrobes - I thought these only existed in the cartoons and kept thinking my bed would shoot me back up against the wall. It was actually quite comfortable.From a location point of view it was great - we flew in to Gatwick and a train brought us straight to St Pancras right across the road. The next day we got a Eurostar from St Pancras, so there was no long walk around London trying to find the hotel.The front door of the hotel is right beside an entrance to Kings Cross/St Pancras tube station so you could almost get to the hotel from the train without getting wet.As mentioned elsewhere the showers are very good - big heads and a good flow of hot water. One little problem was that in the absence of any sort of barrier the water from the shower had a habit of flooding the bathroom floor.Breakfast was included in our room rate - but note it is only the continental breakfast. We went for parts of the full breakfast. Food was very good and relatively good value. I would go for the full breakfast again. It was served in the main restaurant downstairs which is open to the public in the evening.Check-in and check-out were smooth and there were no problems there. The hotel bar is open 24 hours I think. It's a nice comfortable place to while away some time while waiting for others to get ready.The area around has plenty of old-school hotels but I would definitely return here. I tried to book direct with the hotel but they quoted the full rate. When I checked the rate on some of the online engines I got a much better rate.	
+	Aug 4 2009 	Clean friendly and a safe neighbourhood	Stayed here for 5 days. The double room is very small, but it was nice and clean. The bathroom although small was clean and the shower had great pressure (no tub). The breakfast is included and it is nice to have someone bring you a fresh pot of coffee and fresh toast and jam. Breakfast includes, cereal, toast, breakfast pastries, yogurt, juice, tea, cheese, meat and fresh fruit and hard boiled eggs. There are many great restaurants in the area. Front desk staff was very helpful and loaned us an umbrella one night. (We didn't even ask). We received a discount for paying .	
+	Jul 29 2009 	Very good	Good value for money. Friendly service and clean rooms. Near Victoria Station.	
+	Jan 10 2006	A Good Place For London	I recently got back from my trip to the UK and stayed at the Melia White House with my girlfriend upon our arrival. I got a deal off of Hotwire and I was determined not to get stuck with &quot;the hotwire room.&quot; Because I paid significantly less by using Hotwire I was sure that I would have the crappy room next to the elevator or with a window staring at a brick wall. But luckily that was not the case, our room was small, but overlooked the traffic circle outside the hotel and we were able to see the snow falling in the early morning. Good things about the hotel...-The room is small, but its LONDON and its cozy and it has everything you need a bed, a toilet, a tv, and a shower(plus a North American adapted plug) -A staff that was professional and respectable (to us at least)-Location was nice, walking distance to everything.Negatives About the hotel...-The bed could have been a little more comfortable, and the walls could have been a little thicker (you can hear your neighbors TV)-A continental breakfast for 17 pounds (around $30) is like a $40 pizza...it's cannot be worth it-Oh and just in case... The four cheese pizza from Room Service (when everything else is closed)...the worst combinations of cheeses I have ever witnessed.In conclusion, I was nervous upon arrival as I searched every hotel (in the $100 a night range) I saw on trip advisor, but it suited us fine. It is London, wake up and leave in the morning and come back and go to sleep, that is all you need. I will say though, if I had spent $300 a night for this I would be crying!!!Lastly, an odd thing is that when you get off the elevators it is like the inside of a cruise ship, you will see!	
-	Sep 13 2005 	The Worst Customer Service	DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.....I have just found I was charged twice for my stay, they say they kept another room and it was all my fault. No offer of refund or and future discount as good will, they just told me they will do nothing. SO NOT MY ERROR but hotel keeps my cash.....SPREAD THE WORD THIS HOTEL IS ONE TO AVOID!!! (Plus the room was tiny!)My not so helpful customer service woman was Berta - thanks for nothing!	
+	Jul 22 2005	Great for the able	We used this hotel as our choice from a selection offered by Trafalgar Tours. It was rated in the &quot;upper middle&quot; category and the 2005 Trafalgar London/Europe brochure lists it as not having AC. Not true! After a multi-million dollar refurbishment, it was beautiful -- and cool. The Trafalgar book also said that all their tour hotels include a contintental breakfast. Again, they sold the Melia White House short! On our first morning, we asked where the complimentary breakfast was and were directed toward their only dining room with a sign outside that said the breakfast buffet was 19 pounds per person. I said, &quot;Oh, no, we want the FREE breakfast,&quot; but at the Melia, that was it! Eggs, waffles, omlets, pancakes next to an enormous bowl of hot chocolate sauce (whew!); eggs, English breakfast bacon, sandwiches, fruits, piizza, cereals, and on and on and on! Attentive service as well. We saved big bucks by eating a huge breakfast, a mid-afternoon lunch, and then an evening snack instead of dinner. You can save a lot of money this way if you didn't come to London to eat. Hotel is clean and beautifully refurbished, as was our room. Yes it's small, but who goes to London to stay in your room? Hotel backs up on the beautiful Retents Park and is a few steps from the underground. A convenience store (for those aforementioned money saving snacks and fresh fruit) and restaurants are next to the underground station as well. So now the only caveat: in the beautiful remodeling of this hotel, the bathtub in our standard class room was VERY elevated -- apparently to run the drain pipes. This is fine if you're fit and spry (but even then, it's a climb in and out -- hang on to the grab bar); but we talked with an older woman in the lobby who found climbing in and out of the tub downright frightening. Don't know if the higher priced rooms also have this challenge. Other than that, a really wonderful place to stay. Italian airline crews stay there -- usually a good sign.	
+	Aug 3 2003	A Great surprise		
+	Jun 29 2009 	muy bueno		
-	Sep 22 2006 	Worst Hotel Ever	I have travelled around India and SE asia and stayed in some hellholes, but never anything as bad as this place. Stay here at you peril. Never before have I asked for a refund from anywhere, this was the first time. None of the windows actually lock as the catches are all broken, in 1 of our rooms the door didn't lock, beside this room was an external back door which had no lock at all, and an open drain with food scrapings outside this. Mould and flaking paint on the walls. Worst of all is the customer service. Workmen fixing the room next to ours hammering until 1am, the staff did not care in the slightest about this, because I still stayed in the room!! The fact that I got 4 hrs sleep because of their disregard for anyone staying in their hotel did not matter, and the manager pretended he was not there when I asked for a refund. I am a great believer in 'you get what you pay for', but I honestly wish I had decided to sleep on a bench in the tube station nearby. Pick a different hotel	
-	Jul 27 2007 	Would never stay there again!	I booked the Mentone because it was very close to where I was working, it had free Wifi, and their website claimed it to be a non-smoking hotel. Two out three of these things turned out to be true. Since I was traveling alone, I booked a single which was an enormous mistake as these rooms are at the top of a very narrow, twisty staircase. My biggest gripe with the room was not its lack of amenities - when I say lack, I mean lack, ie. no towels on some days, the tv barely worked, tea never replaced, etc. My problem with the room was that it was so smoky that I felt like I had smoked two pack of cigarettes each morning. People smoked through the night and having an open window did not help ventilate the room. The rooms on the top floor are to be avoided at all costs!!! Additionally, be warned - this is an area full of students so if you face the front of the hotel, it will be very loud in the evening. The full English breakfast is not my thing so I cannot comment on it. The Mentone is inexpensive and conveniently located in Bloomsbury but if you don't want lung cancer - avoid it.	
+	Jan 7 2004	Giusto rapporto prezzo-qualità		
+	Jul 10 2007 	Good basic accomodations	Stayed 5 nights at the end of June. This is a good basic hotel with very limited amenities. The hotel provides a room with ensuite shower/wc. Everything was clean and in good condition. Location is good - one block to the Earl's Court tube station and good access to food shops, banks, etc. BUT there is a 2 pound charge to connect your room phone, no TV or radio in the room. If you are a single they give you one towel and one glass, but will provide another if asked. Breakfast is toast or muesli with tea or coffee. There is a 5% charge if you pay in anything but cash. This includes pound sterling traveler checks! Highly recommend paying in cash. Also the manager wants full payment for the stay when you check in.But it is a decent rate and clean and convenient.	
+	Jun 24 2009 	OK		
+	Oct 29 2008 	Best Hotel on Our Trip	Simply a great hotel! Room was outstanding, large, beautiful bath and quiet. Hotel has a great restaurant and is also close to other good places to dine. Located next to a Tube Station and only a few blocks from Harrods. Staff was excellent, they were very accommodating. We would definitely stay here again!	
+	Aug 12 2008 	Fairly good hotel !	We got a very good deal at this hotel that included breakfast and 2 course evening meal. When we arrived the check-in was efficient and quick and our room was ready a little earlier than expected. The rooms were v. clean and quite spacious for a London hotel. We found the beds to be comfy and the air con unit was a blessing, as you could adjust to suit your own needs. The breakfast was good and there appeared to be plenty of staff serving tea/coffee. Now the evening meal- the standard of food was average, however the staff were v. good and attentive (perhaps because they wanted a tip) . My main issue was with the Chefs special menu that was included in our 3 night stay. The starters were exactly the same throughout our stay except for one night when one of them changed. The vegetarian and fish main courses did not change at all and the meat option was the same for 2 nights. A little variation wouldn't have gone a miss! The desserts didn't change at all either! With only 3 options to choose from, this was v. limited and we ended up eating out on our final night. Being vegetarian I couldn't face the same meal for a third night! Regarding the service charge; we just told the staff we had tipped the waiters individually and the service charge was removed from our bill. It is discretionary, although they should allow you to decide if you have had good service or not. Overall great location, average food, good service, comfortable rooms.	
-	Jan 4 2009 	We won't be back	This was our second stay at the Copthorne hotel and am afraid it will be our last as the standard, particularly at breakfast has deteriorated. On our last visit the only complaint we had was about the lack of towels. However, this time the housekeeping could not be faulted.We had booked for 4 nights bed and full breakfast. On the first morning we were able to choose from the hot buffet as well as continental. Next day no hot buffet was offered which we thought may have been because it was New Year's Day. In additition we had to ask 4 times for tea, coffee and toast. On the third day we were offered hot buffet at a supplement of £3. We could not get the waitress to understand that cooked breakfast should have been included in the rate we had paid. We later spoke to the girl on reception who said that due to a change in policy they were now charging £4 for cooked breakfast. She checked our booking and passed on a note to the restaurant manager, so on our final day we were offered cooked breakfast at no extra charge.If the hotel had changed its policy, there should have been information telling guests about this - there was none. Also if the hotel changes its policy midway through a stay, then the existing bookings should be honoured. The hotel was very busy and the choice at the continental breakfast buffet was poor and many items ran out and were not replenished very quickly.This had put us off staying at this hotel in the future. I think it is not really worthy of calling itself a 4 star hotel	
-	Jul 4 2005	not my cup of tea	We stayed at this hotel because it was supposed to be a four star hotel near to where we had a reunion party. Check in was surlyand gave us no indication of amenities at the hotel. Beware, you have to pay extra for the leisure facilities-pool, etc., which is not stated on their website.room was clean. however, no soap in the bathroom, the mattress was lumpy-you could feel the springs in the mattress, and there was no coffee in the room, although there were the facilities. we had to phone to get the windows unlocked for some fresh air, as well as for soap and coffee. they eventually arrived.this was not up to four star standards. sorry, not my cup of tea.	
-	Nov 12 2006 	Ok choice if you can get a deal	My husband and I booked this hotel through Priceline for £50! Once finding out that we were to stay at the Millenium Gloucester and finding the reviews on this website, we were rather nervous about our stay!The lobby/reception area is truly gigantic and well maintained. The staff were efficient and polite and didn't look down their noses at us because we'd evidently booked through Priceline (this did happen once before at another hotel in London!).Our room wasn't one of the newly renovated rooms, but it was clean. It took us a while to find out how the individual lamps worked as the &quot;main&quot; light in the entrance to the room only lit up that bit. Luckily, we weren't electocuted as one person suggested we might be!The room was close to the lift area, but we heard very little noise/movement. The road outside also seemed to be quite quiet on the Sunday morning.The bathroom is definitely very very tired, but again, it was clean with decent sized and a decent amount of towels. Make sure you use the slip-mat that is provided - you need it!We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it was £17.50 per person! Instead, there is a Coffee Republic at the top of the street. There are also a few more cafes closer to the Gloucester Road tube station which also seemed to be serving breakfast.All in all, we had a pleasant stay, but I feel sorry for anyone who pays the full price for the room that we had. The room that we stayed in was one of a tired 3 star standard. However, the position of the hotel was fantastic being in a quiet area, very close to a tube station.	
+	Jul 18 2006	Good location but not much else	We stayed at this hotel as it was where are European Tour was commencing from. We were fortunate that we got to stay in a refurbished room on level 4 - others were not so lucky. The lobby smells like an ashtray - the receptionist was rather offhand and dismissive. Our check in time was 2 pm but on arrival shortly after 2 pm the room was still not ready. There was no apology and we were told the hotel was fully booked and we would just have to wait!The only positives were the hotel's location right near the Gloucestor Rd tube station and just a 15 minute walk to Harrods, Hyde Park and plenty of attractions nearby. The breakfast was also excellent. On the second day the hotel's hot water system packed up so we all had cold showers!	
+	Nov 25 2009 	Reasonable quality for London	Was given room 202. The room itself, for a central London hotel was very good. Unfortunately our room was on a level with a large expanse of flat roof, which in turn housed the extractor fans. Some were cutting in and out especially in the early hours. Then again a day in London is exhausting so personally I got used to the noise after a night and slept like a log in a luxurious bed.The room was clean and tastefully decorated. When you book, include the breakfast which is continental. £5 extra will see you with a full English. Otherwise a full breakfast will set you back £25. One other thing regarding breakfasts - the 'full English' plates are laughably small and more like side dishes. They certainly don't want you to get much. Reception was excellent and very helpful. Staff were nice. The tube is about 300 metres away. Harrods is just around the corner All in all, for a central London hotel (apart from the usual extortionate London price), I'd recommend it.	
-	Aug 27 2009 	not great!	Stayed here last month, had previously stayed in the Westbury Mayfair and thought we'd give this place a try, staff on front desk were below average in the costomer relations dept, room &amp; bed were silly (more like a single room), I asked at front desk if this was the correct room and was met with a blunt &quot;yes&quot;, having payed £160/night the experience was very poor. If your looking for a hotel with poor staff and a tiny room then this is the place for you, otherwise checkout the Westbury! Also worth noting is the hotel caters mostly for middle eastern guests.	
+	Aug 25 2008 	Great location	I stayed at this hotel for a single night on business.Very impressed with reception and the service received here. The bar was excellent and would recommend the afternoon tea for a spot of luxury!The bedroom was a bit of a let down though; small and quite average, I'd have been disappointed if I'd payed rather than my company.Overall good, and what a great location!	
+	Sep 8 2006 	A Decent Mayfair Hotel	With all hotels it's a question of what you're looking for.I travel to London on business regularly and stay overnight about a third of the time. I need somewhere comfortable but above all else quiet. This hotel delivers on those criteria.As other reviewers have noticed there's a refurbishment programme underway. It looks like the rooms at the front have been completed whilst further back they are a bit dingy and in need of brightening up. But the rooms away from the square are likely to be quieter.It's also worth bearing in mind that this is a 4.5 star hotel located in the middle of some of the most expensive real estate in the world. On this basis, some of the internet rates offered on the hotel website are very good value (anything under £200 a night in Mayfair is a bargain at busy times!). But don't be too shocked if you end up in an unrefurbished room. It will be interesting to see what happens to the rates when the refurb is complete.Rooms apart, this is a medium sized, quiet hotel with excellent staff in a great location. If you like a place with a buzz and lively bars this is not for you. If you want something which offers good value just one step down from 5 star then give it a try.	
+	Jul 29 2003	Great Location...Fine Hotel!		
-	Jun 7 2009 	This is a one star no frills budget hotel.	The room is small, dull, colorless and stuffy. The bed covers are old and faded. The pillows ranged from very flat and limp to very old and lumpy. The drinking glasses were not clean. The English breakfast was poorly cooked and uninspired. Some of the staff were not friendly. The toilet did not always flush, even after reporting this problem 3 days in a row.The elevator and hallways have a musty smell.	
+	Aug 13 2004	Great Hotel!!		
-	Oct 29 2009 	Not worth it	Thinking this would be a great place to take my mother for a girly weekend the website certainly sold it - I learned a big lesson- just pay more. The hallway smelled like a toilet in a student flat that may have been due to the bathrooms that are randomly placed around the hotel. We had to get moved as we were on the 4th floor the first night and when I got up to have a shower was told the water pressure was bad and if I waited an hour or so it would be better- really they said that. The en suite in the first room was smaller than my own ensuite and decorated as the rest of the hotel was in a classic 80s style - that was made in the 80s. It was bismal. The best part was upon arrive there was a sign in the window offering rooms for £55. I am sure you can do much worse in London but this was pretty disappointing.	
-	Jun 8 2007 	Avoid this filthy hell hole	Should have posted earlier, but I forgot to verify my review. I agree with all negative reviews. I booked 5 nights online, as I work in London during the week. This is the worst hotel ever and I have stayed in hotels for years due to my worik. It was filthy complete with dust in all the furnishings. Sheets looked clean but the outer bedding was stained with goodness knows what. A window that was flush with the floor, yes it opened at floor level, with no ledge or balcony to stop you from falling out. I have returned covered in bites. no fan in the bathroom. Do not drink the complimentary tea/coffee in reception. The water smelled like a potty. I avoided the breakfast. I wish I'd read reviews before I stayed there. There are plenty of hotels near the tube. You do not need this one.	
+	Sep 27 2006 	Convenient Small Not So Bad	I stayed 2 nights in September 2006. The location next to Earl's Court tube was nice, but the place was small. The staff was incredibly polite and helpful. That in itself was nice. However, the rooms were TINY. If you can manage sleeping in a twin bed (which I have not done in years), it should not be so bad. Just don't expect to bring any overnight company.	
+	Aug 7 2005	Would definately go back again!	This hotel is situated in a prime location in London, with only a short distance to walk to the nearest tube station. My first impressions of Myhotel were excelled by the really friendly and helpful staff at checkin and any questions I had about the local area and things to see and do were quickly and sufficiently answered. My room was an ideal size and very comfortable. The decor generally of the hotel is impressive and modern. The bar is 'upbeat' and trendy and again, staff are very polite. I really enjoyed the ambience in the bar as it was small and 'cosey'. The small gym and internet access is also a bonus for what seemed like an excellent price for such an attractive City centre hotel. I would definately return to the hotel when visiting London again and would recommend it to friends and family.	
+	Aug 19 2009 	hôtel agréable idéal pour un week-end à Londres		
+	Aug 26 2008 	Great location nice hotel	We stayed in this hotel on a family holiday to London. We had a room with 2 double beds and had 2 young children with us. In addition, my parents stayed in another room. We found the hotel to be quite beautiful, in an excellent location and the rooms very quiet despite being located on a busy street. The front desk was very limited in helping with restaurants, advice, etc. but were friendly enough. For the cost, you would think that the internet would be free or and the breakfast not $35 per person.	
+	Jul 1 2008 	Great Location Dirty Rooms	Stayed at the hotel in June 2008. As others have noted, the location is great; about 500 meters to Paddington tube stop (Bakerloo, Circle and District lines) and a little further of a walk underground to get to the main train station where the Heathrow Express comes in. It's a busy area with lots of shops and restaurants but the hotel is on a side block with a nice park in the middle. In my opinion the hotel is 2 star not 3 star. I booked a single and was given a twin so had a bit more room than I expected. The room (502) was on the 5th (top floor) and faced the back of the building so relatively quiet at night even with the window open (I found the room to be very hot). But if you plan to sleep past 8 AM bring ear plugs because the maids literally start slamming the doors to wake people up (I found this every morning, including the weekends). The room was dirty and badly in need of updating. There were some nasty stains on the blanket and bedspread. The sheets were clean though. The bathrooms was old but cleaned well on a daily basis. The door to the room was not secure at all and would be very easy to open with a hard shoulder to the door. I was very concerned with leaving anything of value in the room but luckily I didn't have any problems. There is no safe in the room. There was also no chain or deadbolt on the inside of the door to be able to secure the door when you are in the room. I booked the room using Hotwire and paid about $100 per night. I think for that price in central London, I got what I paid for. If I had paid much more than that, it would not have been worth it.	
+	Sep 6 2009 	excellent service really enjoyable experience	Was a little bit worried about the location but needn,t have worried ,it took about 30 minutes to get into london by rail and tube. really easy to get to and i am useless with maps and directions dont let the location put you off it is well worth it the hotel is relaxing, it has a calm and relaxing atmosphere and the staff cant do enough for you nothing is a problem we booked through superbreak, rail tickets hotel bed and breakfast all included in the price the food was lovely. well worth a look .we had a great time harrods and a show fab weekend thanks for a great stay definately go back x the only negative the drinks at the bar were a little expensive 2 wines and a lager £16 . Ill get over it.	
+	Oct 6 2009 	wonderful	Lovely hotel,really helpful and very pleasant staff.Wonderfully comfortable bed spotlessly clean room,great bar snacks and truly the best breakfast we've ever had in an hotel. only in london for a concert at the O2. hotel arranged minicab but you could use trains, station is next to hotel.car parking spaces are limited, quite small underground car park(£12 per night) not too bad for london	
-	Jul 15 2009 	MORE FOR ADULTS THAN CHILDREN	After reading the reviews of this hotel from other customers we expected a bit of a &quot;wow&quot; factor but we found it pretty much the same as any other Novotel. The reason I was prompted to write is that we chose this hotel mainly to use the swimming pool for our children. I'm sure other families will know how difficult it is to find a family hotel with a pool in central London with a limited budget.Our children aged 5 and 4 were in tears as the swimming pool at this hotel was 5 FIVE AND A HALF FEET DEEP all the way round. No shallow end. Not the thing you would expect from a family friendly Novotel. One morning the manager was greeting guests at breakfast and we highlighted our views to him about children that are unable to swim not being able to use to pool at all. His response was &quot;you will have to bring your armbands the next time&quot;.Useless.	
+	Apr 12 2009 	Lovely rooms great location superb breakfast good gym. Probably my favourite hotel of all.	I stay at the Novotel St Pancras around twice a month, as a base to stay during my central London shopping trips. I love this hotel. The rooms are stylish and nicely sized, and the bathrooms are gorgeous (I love the glass sinks!). The beds are extremely comfy, and despite Euston Road being fairly noisy, it rarely stops me having a good night's sleep. The temperature/air con system is excellent and easy to use.Staff are always very friendly and efficient. I normally pay around £255 flexible rate for two nights (room only) via the hotel's own website, though this sort of price is only available several weeks in advance. In past months I have booked an advanced purchase rate for two nights including breakfast for two, for around £230. I feel that what I pay to stay at this hotel is very well worth it.The breakfast buffet is superb, and has LOADS of choice - English cooked breakfast, lots of cereals, cold meats, fruits, yoghurt, juices, pastries, breads, rolls. The restaurant area is very stylish and modern. I haven't tried the restaurant, as I normally go one of the restaurants at the nearby Brunswick centre.The gym is quite well equipped, as far as hotel gyms go, and is immaculately kept.The hotel is situated in a very convenient area - just five minutes' walk from Euston and Kings Cross stations. Five minutes' walk from the hotel is Bloomsbury, where you can find off licenses, restaurants, and the lovely Brunswick centre, which has a Waitrose, some clothing stores and several restaurants.Out of all the hotels I have stayed in, I think this is my favourite. I would recommend it to anyone.	
+	Jun 4 2006	Comfortable stay	Ours was a short stay of 2 nights. The 2 rooms were ready when we arrived at 10:30 am. Both rooms were located on the back side of the hotel which was very quiet. Rooms with twin beds had minimal walking space, but a nice closet. Rooms with a queen bed had more space, accommodating a table and chair. The rooms and bathrooms were clean. Beds gave us a great nights sleep. Staff was quick to grant our request for extra pillows. The hair dryer was located in the closet, near the safe, but reached to a wall mirror outside the bathroom. The tea tray was replaced daily. The halls were quiet and clean. This is a large hotel, but we never had a long wait for the elevator. The center elevator is glass on the exterior of the building and gives you a wonderful view of the area.Ice machines did not work on all floors. Staff offered to send ice up from the bar, when I needed ice. The staff was very professional and helpful. We found the hotel to be close to the tube... Euston Station. There was an abundant of places to eat at the station and on the side streets between the station and hotel, if you did not eat at the hotel. The British Library was located across the side street. The fact that I was a priceline guest was never mentioned. I elected to not give my credit card number to the hotel, and this was not a problem. Check out was quick and professional.We were very satisfied with our stay and would here again.	
+	Aug 2 2004	Nice place - well located		
+	Jun 21 2009 	Clean but far away from everything	Clean, modern hotel with superb breakfast buffet. Unfortunately far away from cental London. If you want to see Big Ben, stay somewhere closer. Relativley close to London's Tube (subway), so you can get to Big Ben in about half an hour. You are one or two Tube stops from london rail system. Little on the expensive side, with no ethnic flair, but sometimes you need that when traveling. Comfort is king here. Amenities exceed typical UK standards and even most US standards. No wash cloths.	
+	Apr 21 2008 	Good Location	Have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. Overall i was very impressed with the hotel, for a london hotel the rooms were larger than average. We had a large travel cot and had room for a large pushchair and there was plenty of room left ( When people say the rooms are small i do wonder what they are doing in them!)Yes some of the furniture had seen better days in the bedroom but it was VERY clean. I am quite fussy and i can honestly say that i looked for dirt and didnt find any (not even on the bottom of the shower curtain)It is a massive hotel and may be it could do with a few more lifts but the bar service was good and breakfast was lovely.The location of the hotel is excellent for anyone coming from the west who wants to bring the car for a short time. parking is £1 an hour if you are a hotel resident and the tube station is only 3 minutes walk away.It was a bit noisy on saturday night but that can only be expected in such a large hotel.	
+	Jun 18 2009 	What a way to start your honeymoon!	Wonderful hotel, fantastic staff, so kind and thoughtful, going above and beyond to make our wedding night more special than either of us could have imagined. There aren't many hotels in london that would bother to leave you a hand written note frmo the hotel manager wishing you congratulations. Our room was upgraded to a fabulous suite with a private balcony over looking the aldwych and i was taken aback by the level of service we received, from arrival to check out, even after we had returned from our honeymoon a month later we received a note from the hotel just to ask if we had enjoyed our stay. Superbe hotel, fantastic location and wonderful service. Thank you thank you thank you for making the happiest day of my life, more of a fairy tale than i could ever have imagined! Stay here if you want to feel like Cinderella!	
+	Mar 20 2009	This hotel has the WOW factor	Just had 3 nights stay at this hotel in their Aldwych room, the cheapest room they have. Although small it was perfect for us. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely with a very deep bath. From arriving to departing the service we received was excellent. The staff are very friendly and helpful when you need advice. We had a good package booked through luxury exployer. The room rate included breakfast and use of the pool etc. We even had complmentary champagne and canapes, perfect. Breakfast was very good, what I like was the breakfast was made to order, no buffet style here. Want to go back, will book a deluxe room next time just for a treat,	
+	Mar 11 2009 	Excellent value for money and well positioned hotel	Great position and most convenient.The hotel is newly refurbished, and has a much better appearance than previously. The rooms are most comfortable, and very good value for money. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They sell tickets and advised well on entertainment, and I found them to be honest and caring. The general manager seems to be on duty for very long hours and is usually available if one needs to discuss anything with him. He was professional and prompt in his service. The hotel is extremely conveniently positioned for central London, as well as access to both Heathrow and Gatwick airports. I used West Brompton station to Gatwick, as well as the Piccadilly line straight through to Heathrow.Thank you for an excellent service. I shall most certainly return again when I am in London.	
-	Jun 27 2008 	Unrateable	Faulty Towers has nothing on this hotel. It is absolutely the pits. Having cause along with colleagues to stay at hotels in London on a regular basis we all now give them a rating so that we know which hotels to avoid and I am afraid that I just could not rate this hotel as it really is disgusting. First and foremost it smells, it looks like it has never had anything done to it since it was built probably in the Victorian days. It is patently obvious that the owners are only interested in making as much money as possible and do not give one iota about the customers. Its that disgusting that I wanted to go out and buy cleaning materials such as bleach etc and give it a good clean as it made my skin crawl I was just so glad that I was only there for 2 days and if it had not been for the fact that Wimbledon was on and all hotels in the area were booked I would have stayed elsewhere. The rooms were really really bad the bathroom was so small if you sat on the toilet your knees where just about touching the sink. The sink and toilet where flush with the door so as you opened the door you walked into the sink. If you are unlucky enough to be put on the top floor then be prepared to haul your luggage up a number of flights of stairs as they do not have a lift. And if you do not get a room in the main hotel then you have to walk down the road to another building to your room and then back out to the main reception next morning for breakfast which is a joke. The whole experience was one big fiasco from start to finish. I cant emphasize enough how bad this hotel is and quite frankly it really does not even deserve a terrible rating. There is no rating that can reflect the state of this hotel. Whomever gave it a 2 star rating needs to re-evaluate as it does not even deserve a 1 star rating.	
	-	No Wildlife Spotted but Stay Away!	Sure wish I had found these reviews before booking. We just got back yesterday after spending six nights at this motel. We felt like ditching it as soon as we got there but just managed to spend alot of time away from it. We had a 4th floor (no elevator) triple room with three beds squeezed in, one picture on the wall. One bare lightbulb fixture lit the whole room, no glasses, no shampoo, no chest of drawers, you can't dial out on the phone and there was no phone book (or even bible) shower stall only with water that barely had enough force to rinse hair. Breakfast consisted of cold cereal, toast/jam/butter, hard boiled eggs, cheese, beverages. Be sure not to wear your pajama bottoms down to the breakfast lounge. Lobby consisted of one small sofa about 20' from the reception desk and you must bring your own computer down there to access internet. At least location was okay in terms of catching bus/tube, restaurants nearby, walk to Kensington/Hyde Park and even Piccadilly Square. Surely you can find something better........ there were lots of motels on the same block and one over (hostel is right next door) around this same area whose lobbies looked much better. Wasn't even that inexpensive.	
+	Nov 19 2009	very pleasant stay/no complains	This hotel was very nice! I wonder why so many bad comments? during check in time we were told that we were upgraded to junior suite without any extra cost, although the junior suite seems to be not too big was absolutely perfect for us. It had a microwave and a fridge at no extra cost. I must say that hotel is in very good location and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Very highly recommended for a good quality in reasonable price/Anna	
-	Apr 19 2008 	Mould glorious mould!!	WHAT THE? We were placed on the top floor in a room that appears to have been bigger than most. The toilet/shower was absolutely disgraceful - full of mould and a filthy stench coming from the drain. The actual shower wasnt big enough to bathe a baby in. The weather was atrocious - which I only mention because it was reflected in our room. The bed and all of the blankets/sheets were soaking wet because the roof was leaking all over it. We ended up having to move the bed (which was actually a mattress sitting on wooden boxes) into another position in the room because of the rain.Renovations were being completed in the room next door to us, although these only ever occurred from 11.00 pm until the early hours of the morning. The builders were obviously nocturnal.We stayed here for 4 nights and at the end of it, we were both really sick. We went to check out to find the doorman asleep in a sleeping bag on the floor of reception. We gratetfully threw the keys in his general direction and walked out. I think I would have much rather stayed on a bench in the local park, which I will probably be doing should we again find ourselves in the same position.After having stayed at a large number of hostels, this hotel is only good for knocking down. Do yourself a favour and don't even consider it.	
-	Sep 6 2007 	I will never be the same again...	We stayed in the Park Hotel in December of 2005. Even after this time I still can't get over how bad it was.My wife and I stayed with another couple who we were travelling with in the very bottom room of the place (it had two double beds). Our first impression was VERY LOW BUDGET, but we had accepted it would probably be cheap and nasty when we booked - and we had decided the location was worth the risk.I can still remember the room and its problems even now. I get a chill down my spine thinking of it. Here's a list of what was wrong:1) My wife pulled back the bedsheets and found a used band-aid. So much for clean sheets! We slept in sleeping bags instead on top of the bed. The beds were also awful. I'm sure they must have been on Noah's Ark.2) Our room was right below the entrance. Every time (lasting until 2am in the morning) when someone entered the hotel above us, we were all woken by the creaking floor above.3) The shower/toilet/basin made it possible to simultaneously shower, do a #2 and clean your teeth at the same time. Not that we did, but it was the first (and only) such bathroom where this would be theroretically possible that we have seen.4) On the subject of the bathroom - a furry mould grew in it, and water leaked out of it into the room at the rate that the Thames River discharges into the sea.5) The TV was precariously placed on a wardrobe. I refused to sleep under it because I felt that either the TV would fall down, or the wardrobe would collapse - either case leading to a visit to the Royal London Hospital if it happened. I was frankly amazed that the TV was in colour given its age.6) Some rude staff. One of the staff members would abuse his cleaning staff in front of guests for being 2 minutes late. Very unprofessional, and also uncomfortable.7) Stairs down to our room were so narrow I had to go down sideways. I am not overweight. The width of the stairwell would have been approximately 40-50cm.So far... 7 points against. The only plus is the location. We did stick it out for our full 5 nights, though, as we didn't have the money to book a better place. I'm not quite sure what ill effects I suffer to this day after staying there - but I'm sure there must be something. No one could stay in a place like that and not pick up some disease/fungus.Oddly enough one staff number took a liking to us. He even referred to us &quot;Ah my friends from number 1&quot; (our room number was 1). I suspect that may have been because we set a record for the length stayed there, and he thought we might give the place a glowing review.He is sadly mistaken.	
-	Mar 31 2004	what a dump in lovely victoria!	we arrived at 9.30 exhausted not quite a 3 minute walk from victoria as mentioned in the website more like 25 mins! the man behind the desk was very vague only interested in what time we were checking out!! we had room 215 on the third floor naturally no lifts. the bedroom was a shambles the curtains were filthy the nets black.oh yes there was tea and coffee making facilities with powdered milk - 2 of - and a bathroom worthy of being on the &quot;Dr Who&quot; as it was just like the tardis! on my life this is possibly the worst flea pit in London 2* for what reason I would love to know dont tell your friends about this place they will think you are cheap!	
+	Jun 27 2007 	Satisfactory.	The hotel interior and roooms were quite nice, however the window in our room would not open and the bath took hours to drain after a shower. We had a very disappointing evening meal in the restaurant. Service very slow (even though there were only two other tables dining - it was a Saturday evening) The quality of the food was not great considering the prices. I would visit again but would not pay any more than the 360 that we paid for 3 nights in a twin room.	
-	Jun 29 2007 	It's OK but not worth the price	After booking the Bedford and seeing it was awful, we moved to the Bonnington down the street. The hotel was nice and clean but definitely not worth the price (we eventually moved to the Russell Hotel which was amazing for the same price). The breakfast is nice and included with the room but the front desk just cannot get it together. I was there for business and was doing phone interviews with Radio and Media and they would not put my calls through or give me messages even though I asked them several times! I lost a national interview because of it and had to fight for an apology.The internet is very expensive in this hotel so, if you stay there, go down towards Russell Square to an internet cafe that offers an hour for a pound.	
-	Oct 4 2004	Good Hotel but SMALL (and I mean SMALL) beds	Stayed for two nights at the Bonnington in Sept 04. Overall Hotel pretty good (even if we did have two fire alarms just as I was getting into the bath - seems someone kept smoking in a no smoking room.) Room size was adequate and although at the front overlooking Southampton Row - traffic noise was minimal. Incl full breakfast was very good. However they really should do something about the so-called double beds. I would class them as a large single. Consequently my wife &amp; I hardly slept which spoiled what was otherwise a good value for money break. Needless to say we shall be staying elsewhere on our next trip to London.	
+	Apr 12 2007 	Nice hotel great location	We spent 9 nights at the Park International Hotel in March. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was very nice. Great location, we would stay there again.	
+	Aug 7 2009 	Good price  location and a free upgrade but a few small problems	We stayed at the Park Plaza for six nights in July 2009. On arrival we found we had been upgraded to a junior suite which was an excellent surprise. The suite was really two rooms, a bedroom ( nearest the entry door, oddly enough ) and a living room. The suite was outfitted and decorated in a subdued hi-tech design with two flat screen TVs, a microwave, iron, kettle etc, all in stainless steel. We had a view over County Hall to the London Eye ( the top of it anyway ) and for the hotel location ,next to a main road and Waterloo Station, the room was very quiet.The problems? None of the front desk staff seemed to be native English speakers and several wore &quot;Trainee&quot; badges so it was hard to get checked in quickly. Our room wasn't cleaned one day by the time we returned at 4m and on our way out at 6pm we reminded the front desk people of this , however it still had not been done when we got back at 11pm that night. An email asking the location of the nearest tube and mainline rail stations wasn't answered either ( for the record the nearest tube is Westminster ,although this means a walk over Westminster Bridge, and Waterloo mainline is next door ) but for what we paid and the location, these are minor quibles. We didn't take the breakfast option due to the cost and the reported long queues ( even the hotel advised that there were long queues on weekends ) but with a microwave and kettle in your room plus daily supplies of decaf and normal coffee and tea from the hotel, all you need to do is buy a box of cereal bars from any Sainsburys, Tesco or Marks &amp; Spencer mini store or some croissants and you have your own in - room breakfast service for next to nothing.	
-	Mar 7 2008 	still getting up to speed	Stayed on Business for three nights. Initial impressions are good all bright, shiny and new. However having stayed here three days it is fair to say the hotel is still working towards full efficiency.Firstly, I was upgraded to a suite, near the lift's. For some strange reason they have particularly loud chimes on the lifts making sleep near them impossible. Until they change this do not accept a room near the lifts.Second room was very good standard and well insulated from noise. Nice bathroom, and separate lounge area.Breakfast was constantly chaotic, long waits to be seated, slow service, but the buffet is good.Several fire alarms one evening, lift call buttons stuck, door not locking properly. What you would expect from a new premises.If they sort this out could be a gem.

+	Jul 24 2008 	great hotel - central located - but still in a quite area - excellent for long s	We stayed as a family in this hotel for 12 days partly business partly private. The hotel is great, luxery rooms. very pleasant staff working the hotel. rooms are clean. we really enjoyed staying in London fro such a long period	
+	May 14 2008 	Good Value Weekend Rate	Good value hotel 5 - 10mins walk from Westminster and Waterloo. Probably a 4*, with decent sized rooms and bathrooms, all furnished well with Wifi in the rooms.We booked the &quot;Enjoy the Weekend&quot; rate which was around £120 for a superior room, continental breakfast, late checkout and free bottle of wine. Room very clean, breakfast was varied and fresh (we paid a £4 upgrade to full English). I would recommend that you include breakfast in the rate, as it is very expensive at £13.50/£17.50 for continental/ English.Only small downside is the lack of nearby tube station. The Victoria line was suspended when we visited so could not use Vauxhall, but I think even this station is 10 mins away. We had to walk along the South Bank in very warm weather with bags (but to be fair, it is a lovely walk past the London Eye and Houses of Parliament and we could have got a taxi). Otherwise, absolutely no complaints.	
+	Dec 31 2006 	Great hotel	We stayed in Riverbank Park Plaza for two nights and paid $370 including taxes. Great value!!! The hotel is on the Thames, 15 minutes from Big Ben and London Eye on foot.The hotel is modern with the usual amenities available at a 4-star hotel. At $185 per night in London, given the location and the room, it was a great value.The bathroom was great - both a tub and a shower stall.	
+	Nov 29 2005	amazing view lovely atmosphere	First time I stayed at this hotel but absolute not the last. The best service and outstanding rooms. Loved the modern architecture	
-	Aug 19 2006 	Pot Luck	My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in August. Having read the reviews and visited the hotel I think visitors take pot luck as to how good it will actually be. Unless you go for the superior rooms there's no guarantee of what you will get. My husband has stayed there a couple of times before on business and has seen various rooms supposedly all at the same corporate rate. Even though this time they knew there was 2 of us, we had a smaller room than he's had before, no bath, chipped sinked, a view of roof tops and air conditioning units and due to the close proximity of at least 8 of such units (i.e. directly below our window, facing up) there was a constant hum, 24 hrs a day. The glass bathroom doors are a joke. If the privacy thing wasn't enough, and that's down to personal choice, they don't work! Perfect example of form over function. Someone thought they'd look good but as they don't actually do what a door and a wall are suppose to do, why bother. They clang and rattle, they don't fit the space so there is at least a inch gap and due to the positioning of the mirror, even with the door as closed as much as possible you can still see into the bathroom from the main room. The fire alarm went off at 2am with no apology or explaination the following day. Turns out it was someone smoking in a non smoking room. The room wasn't serviced properly (no tea and coffee refills) and wasn't done until after 2pm, which I discovered after being out for almost 5 hours. I then had to change my plans and go out again whilst they did the room. Some people seem to get breakfast included in their rate and others don't and it doesn't seem to matter how much you pay. Whilst the food is good it is very overpriced - £14 for croissants, £10 for boiled egg and soldiers! There are loads of coffee shops etc nearby which do breakfast menus which are much better value.The public areas of the hotel are very nice and I'm sure many of the rooms are too but not all of them are and visitors need to know what to expect - check before hand about baths, don't be afraid to ask for a different room if you don't like what you get - I wish we had. It's not that it is a bad hotel, it's just that for the money you expect more and you expect everyone to receive an equal level of service. As the title says it's pot luck 2 people paying the exact same rate could end up with completely different experiences, facilities and level of service. If some rooms aren't as good, charge less! Don't make people feel lucky they got one of the bigger ones. Having stayed there now I'm not suprised that almost everyone I witnessed checking in was having the more expensive rooms sold to them at extra cost.My husband will probably have to go back but as he's had to complain everytime he stays, he won't be looking forward to it. I on the other hand won't bother.	
+	Jun 23 2009 	Hassle Free Hotel	I stay here regularly while on business in London. Its certainly not the plushest hotel out there but represents good value for money. The rooms are mid-sized with the usual amenities (desk, tv, small table, safe, etc) and always clean.The location is so-so.... Victoria is a bustling area but somewhat charachterless, although it is close to many of the major tourist attractions and very handy for the tube.The only complaint I had about this hotel was when I tried to look for a cable for the &quot;free internet&quot; I was told they were all in use. I was not best pleased... but after some strong words they agreed to enable the wireless access for me at no extra charge.	
-	Sep 1 2008 	Needs to try harder	Stayed 4 nights, arriving Wednesday 27th August. Having read earlier reviews about reservation issues I phoned the hotel two days before just to check all in order as room booked via hotels reservation department over a month in advance. I had requested a walk in shower as friend has undergone hip replacenent and unable to climb over bath sides, I was assured all was in hand and exact room specified was available. On arrival, the room, a twin with a shower, with executive package was not available. Allocated a room on the 2nd floor, atrium view, which I was assured was a 'good quiet room'. On entering the room we were greated by an ironing board still up, dirty dishes, newspaper in the bathroom, beds made but dirty linen. I returned to the reception desk, a few internal calls, confirmed the room had been serviced and back checked, this clearly was not the case. I was then offered another room on the 6th floor, our executive package would have to follow and would be sent up. The bags were then transferred to our final room on the 6th floor, I would not really rate an 'executive', but it did have a view, was light, decoration getting a bit tired, glass vanity top had chunk of glass broken off, old style tv, carpet and decoration must be due for refurbishment. So we ended up in a room, not really what we wanted but forced to accept. The executive package arrived on a wooden tray after 10minutes, great service but this was a comb, sewing kit, two pairs of slippers, some better coffee, face clothes (which were never replaced during stay) and bathrobes (which had seen better days), not forgetting two apples and an orange, we never got the chocolates mentioned in the package!!It quickly became apparent paying extra for executive rooms does not mean you get any better rooms. The real and I would suggest the only benefit was access to the Executive lounge, this was used for breakfast and predinner drinks.The one member of staff who stood out over all others was the lady who served breakfasts mid week in the Executive lounge, very helpful, very polite, if only all the reception staff could rise to her standard, just how much better the hotel would be.The executive lounge did change at the wekend, with families staying, the quiet atmosphere lost, but still a great concept if standards maintained.Check out OK, errors quickly corrected, bags left for collection, when collected, no offer to get a taxi or enquire if assistance required. It was probably easier and quicker just to arrange yourself, but it would have been nice to be asked.	
+	Jul 21 2008 	Pleased	Was very nervous about staying here after reading some of the reviews , but was pleasantly suprised. We booked direct through hotel website for executive room with kingsize bed and extra child bed. We arrived at 13.30 and found the staff courteous and helpful, they had not put an extra bed in our room, but contacted housekeeping immediately and this was done within 10 mins while we used executive lounge.The room was a good size and clean and modern, everything worked, we had compilmentary goodies as descibed under package, only complaint was rock hard pillows but housekeeping would change these. We used executive lounge for coffee and breakfast. After a previous review we were nervous about using it for breakfast but was pleasantly suprised- the breakfast was buffet:croissants, muffins,rolls ,cereals,fruit etc.toast you did yourself. The counter stuff was cheese,salami,ham,smoked salmon, poached fish.Then there was hot items, sausage,bacon,grilled tomatoes, scrambled egg. The lounge was very quiet, not suprising really after what some reviewers had said.It wasn't top notch , but not bad either.Check out was easy and painless and staff were happy to store our backage until collection later in the day. Perhaps other travellers had higher expectations , we had none and were pleasantly suprised	
-	Dec 24 2007 	terrible!	Having stayed here on business I booked two non smoking rooms directly with the hotel expressing at the time we were strict about having non smoking rooms.Arriving to find we were allocated smoking rooms and to be told the hotel was full and we could not move ensured we had a smelly room for the night. We also had to put up with people wandering floor one smoking (which I thought is now against the law?) The staff were ok but stated &quot;oh we have a lot of Air France crew who ingnore the UK laws and smoke freely&quot;!!not good enough, I ask for a part refund which was refused so...I won't stay there again which means another hotel will get my company business.	
+	Jul 30 2006 	Very Pleasant stay at Vicoria Park Plaza	I'm not sure what people expect in London. This hotel offers incredible deals (we got a nice discount deal). This is a very stylish and cool hotel that is conveniently located in center of London. You can grab a cab, take a bus or train, and go anywhere in London. Loved the hop on and off bus that you can catch a couple blocks from the hotel. The breakfast was OK by hotel standards with all the usual fare. The real surprise was the food in the bar atrium area just off the lobby, very good pasta, burgers etc. Kids loved it. The rooms were modern with all the conveniences and comfortable. This is a great value considering how expensive London is -- don't know why people would complain. You shouldn't be disappointed here.	
-	Jan 27 2006 	Service was awful	Stayed here several times over past few months thinking it should get better. they left a prawn sandwich in my room and a half eaten cream cake in the mini bar for 4 days. They overcharged me by £300 on checkout! I will never stay here again	
+	Nov 17 2005	Comfortable place to stay	The Park Place Victoria Hotel is a very nice and comfortable hotel. It is close to the Underground station which is a plus as we wanted to travel to London via the Underground from Hethrow airport. We aquired this hotel through Hotwire and were expecting the typical you will get the worst room that we have that we often get when purchasing through Hotwire, but we were pleased that the staff were willing to accomodiate our preferrences.The room was large - similar to USA hotels. The bathroom was very nice. The hotel was not in a beautiful location but we were not in London to just look out the window.	
+	Feb 2 2005	Wonderful Hotel!	Wow! Large, modern, clean hotel with plenty of restaurants nearby. We stayed here in October of 2004. Our room was very large and clean with Euro, UK, and 110v outlets. The bathroom was very nice and had heated mirrors above the sink and tub!The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is a very short walk to Victoria Station and there is a very large Sainsbury Market nearby. Not more than a mile from Buckingham Palace. Be sure to ask for a room that faces Big Ben. If we are ever lucky enough to get to London again this is where we will be staying.	
+	Oct 12 2007 	Pleased with Parkwood	I spent a few days at the Parkwood Hotel this September and my experience was very pleasant. I travel solo and I travel light. What I want from a hotel is a soft bed and a firm reservation. I got both from the Parkwood along with a smiling, helpful staff, a great location, a terrific English breakfast each morning, and all at a fair price. This establishment and its staff gave me everything I wanted and more. On returning from a visit to the continent I was upgraded at no charge when the placed filled up. One very helpful act was just making the reservation booking process so simple. My query Email was quickly returned and a short two minute phone call confirmed the reservation. Easy. There were no surprise when I arrived and none when I departed. One drawback for some may be the lack of an elevator. The building was most likely built as a private home and there are some stairs. Though it is a hotel it has the personal quality of a B&amp;B. I have no problem returning to the Parkwood on my next visit. It'll be the easiest part of planning my trip.G. GriffithNew York, USA	
+	Sep 20 2007 	Put Off at the Parkwood	The best I can say is that this B&amp;B is clean and reasonably priced. That's about it. Desperately needs renovating - starting with a coat of paint. My two major complaints are the surly staff who gave us the impression they couldn't care less if we enjoyed our stay or would ever come back; and the 'full English breakfasts'. I may never eat eggs again.	
-	May 27 2007 	attitude problems	The rooms were ok,not great, but the big problems were:1.Our room was on the fourth floor, no elevator. When we wanted to check out we asked for someone to carry our suitcases down the stairs, which were very steep, the answer was- the porter does not work on weekends, so there is nothing they can do. is that service?2.When we checked out we were very surprised to see a 2 pound charge for each day we used the safe in our room. this has never happened to us in any hotel worldwide. When trying to talk with the girl at the desk she said there's nothing she can do. Her attitude was not the one you would expect in a hotel you spend a lot of money to stay at. We asked to speak with the manager and she said that is not possible, the manager will be back in two days... There was noone to talk with.We will not go back to this hotel.	
-	Nov 28 2007	tiny rooms	Small rooms, meagre breakfast. Digital door key did not work twice. We only got one key and had to practically beg to get a second one. Bed was not made up when we entered the roomin the afternoon upon arriving. We did not pay much cause booked last minute via ratestogo.com but at the full rate, this hotel would have been the definition of a rip-off.	
-	Nov 3 2007	Dreadful	Dreadful - the room was minute and the bathroom was on a different floor! It was dirty with poor facilities, poor help, poor food; they didn't even have an AtoZ. AVOID.	
-	Sep 27 2006 	Horrendous	I booked this hotel for 3 nights as it was advertising a good deal on a website I was looking at - I can see why now!The hotel reception looks lovely - but it is misleading - the whole place needs updating and sprousing up. The staff were miserable and you think these are the people who are going to be making your stay enjoyable for the next few nights! As with the other review, I took one look at the room and wanted to run and hide - through the winding corridors, and the 15 minutes it took to find the room (walk don't trust the lifts!), it was defintly not worth the wait. The room (supposed to be a double but was a twin) was very dated, the walls were damp with the wall paper peeling. The door to the bathroom was at a slant and smaller than my hips so I had to go in sideways - you could shower use the toilet and wash your hands at the same time it was that small - clean, but small. The rooms were only £35 a night so i wasn't expecting much, but at the same time, i could of stayed in a travelodge for the same price and enjoyed it much more. In the end we ended up staying in the Thistle Piccadilly which was amazing - but not cheap.	
-	Jun 1 2006 	Extremely disappointing!		
+	Sep 28 2009	Wonderful Hotel amazing Service	From the initial enquiry they were helpful and informative. They made us feel very special, the room was beautiful and the staff are so friendly.	
+	May 6 2009 	Just what we needed.	After flying in from Prague, and dealing with a poor customer service, the Premier Inn was a nice change of pace. The friendly people in the hotel were amazing. We were always asked &quot;are you okay?&quot; &quot;Do you need anything?&quot; We ate at the bar once and had drinks there on another occasion. The food was quite good for hotel food and the cost wasn't too bad. The location was fabulous. The tube is so close but we only took it a few times because we enjoyed walking everywhere. (Granted, we were only in London 3 days).You'll probably need to request more towels, as there was only one is our double room.The breakfast was wonderful! A lot to choose from.One problem with our stay was upon check-out we asked for them to call us a cab and needed one that took credit cards. They told us we needed to go to the Waterloo Station to do this. I wasn't happy with this and I was unclear why this would be so difficult to arrange. We ended up dragging our bags across the streets of London in search of a cab. Not a very good ending to an otherwise nice trip to London. The only other problem I could see....the interent connection was pricey and you enen had to pay to use the safe. I don't know when I have seen that before? Overall, I would recommend and I would go back.	
+	Apr 29 2009 	Excellent Location in Central London for Families	The location was excellent, within walking distance to lots of attractions. Easy walking distance to Waterloo station for trains and Underground. Even though so central, hotel was quiet at night. Breakfast was good. Room was comfortable and spacious. One double bed, one single bed and a single mattress on floor. Room was large enough to take another proper single bed instead of mattress on floor. Restaurant in hotel had good variety of meals for parents and children. Staff all very friendly and helpful.	
+	Feb 17 2009 	excellent value	Having previously stayed at the Tower Bridge Hilton, a move a mile or so down the south bank inevitably resulted in comparisons.So obviously there is less glitz,brighter colours,and cheaper fittings,but the professional attittude of the staff is absolutely the equal and coupled with the combination of its location and excellent breakfast ensure that this hotel is a sure fire value choice for a family weekend break.	
+	Jul 13 2008	Excellent Hotel	We stayed at the Premier Inn London County Hall for 4 nights in June 2008. Rooms are very clean, spacious, functional and fairly quiet. Conveniently located near the London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, London Aquarium and other attractions.Easy access to the tube (Waterloo or Charing Cross Stations) and bus. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Great breakfast at £7.50 for adults, it is very good value. There is a mini-mart across the street that we used to purchase small item groceries when needed. We Highly recommend this hotel. Would stay here again.	
+	Jan 22 2007	Great hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Premier Travel Inn, London County Hall for several days in January 2007. We stayed here twice, once for a few days at the beginning of our vacation, and then for one night at the end on our way back.This is a very nice hotel. The rooms we stayed in were quiet and very clean, and the hotel is in a great location. It's really easy to get to all kinds of interesting parts of London, and there are two nearby tube stops. (From the airport, the easiest stop is Westminster, although the Waterloo station is a bit closer. The tube takes around an hour, though a couple of times it took longer---maybe 1.25 or 1.5 hours---we're not sure why.)Check-in was easy, although it took a little longer than I expected. They offer breakfast, but we declined---I stayed here six years ago, and the breakfast was definitely not worth the cost. I recommend grabbing something at the Starbucks across the street instead.The biggest downside to this hotel is that the bed is pretty bad. In the first room we stayed in, the bed managed to be both firm and saggy at the same time. In the second room the bed was a little better, but still nothing great.Wireless internet is available in the rooms, but it's not cheap; 3 GBP for 30 minutes, as of Jan 07, and slightly cheaper for longer times.As far as I could tell, this hotel is one of the best options for staying in London. I definitely recommend it.	
+	Mar 30 2008 	Top Shelf Premier Inn	I have stayed at 3 Premier Inns and found them all to be great values, but this facility was the best of the three. The location near King's Cross provides easy access to trains &amp; tubes. There are many eateries in the area and a Marks &amp; Spencer in the St Pancras station.My room faced the interior building court and was very quite. As with most Premier Inns, the room was large clean, and fresh. Why would you stay anywhere else when visiting London or other UK cities?	
+	Mar 27 2008 	Functional but prices have risen	I have stayed here three times.This place is fine - Last time I stayed 4 nights and had no major problems. It is well located - 2 mins from King's Cross/St. Pancras.The beds are nice and the hotel is very clean. Food is not bad in the hotel and there are a few nice places to eat within a 20 minute walk. Staff are very friendly.However the prices have risen recently and I don't feel it belongs in the budget category anymore.	
+	Apr 9 2008 	Weekend in London	What can I say, you can not really go wrong with a Premier Inn, the room was very clean, the shower was hot, the food was good. Location is not bad as it is near London Bridge and London Bridge tube stop is about 12min walk.	
+	Jan 1 2009 	It was an acceptable hotel	Waiting staff in the breakfast room were very good and very nice, dispite other guests sitting near us being openly rude and dismissive to them! Breakfast was good lots of choice and cooked excellently.The rooms were very acceptable, bathroom was spacious and shower was very powerful. Clean and enough room to get ready for the night out we had planned. Down side was the reception staff - we had multiple rooms booked they had not allocated enough rooms although it was printed on the fax confirmation they had received and had attached to our booking.They could not understand what the problem was when they booked one of our guests who was supposed to be in a single room into a twin room which had been advised to them was for two other guests, as the two other guests did not want to share a bed! But never mind, all was sorted in the end - and an enjoyable stay was had by all.	
+	Jan 1 2007 	Great value!	In April 2006, we spent a delightful fortnight in London's with the President Hotel as our home base.From the outset we knew we weren't looking for the 5-Star experience. What we wanted was a safe, quiet, clean and comfortable place to stay that wouldn't break our budget. Our room on the second floor was all that.The location is unbeatable - steps away from Russell Square, five minutes max. to the British Museum. A ten minute walk from Covent Garden and the West End.+ the friendly, helpful staff, + spotless rooms,+ location,+ price- rooms were a bit small- no internet access in rooms, access in lobby was unreliable	
+	Jul 17 2005	the rooms are ok	The room are ok. Only the rooms. The service is the worse I had ever seen in my whole travel life! I believe it is due to change of owners as once I had a wonderful experience but that was years ago when British people were in charge. The supervisor is very very very rude and care about the visitors, nothing. It was truly a nightmare and in my return home I have told so many friends about it. Prefer to stay in a home type hotel near Russell square. By the way, my suitcase was left behind in Rome and I told the supervisor about it and also the clerks and they send the luggage back stating I was not staying at the hotel.	
-	Jul 19 2005	Bed Bugs Galore	We stayed in this Hotel because of the proximity to London. Reading your reviews I was convinced a previous guest was watching Big Brother on the TV. It was very hot so the window was open all the time. I thought the bed bugs I killed were beetles that had flown in. Until my wife had an alergic reaction to &quot;BED BUGS&quot; bite. Medical treatment confirmed this and a course of anti-hystamines slowly controlled the forty or so itchy bites all over her body. They took 4 weeks to disappear. Do not stay in this Hotel. Cheap is what it is, cheap is what you get.	
-	Feb 27 2004	Could be so much nicer		
+	Nov 18 2009 	Genial!!!!		
+	Nov 5 2007	A really good hotel	Pleasently suprised with this hotel after reading some of the other reviews, the hotel was clean and well situated for the rest of london ,with the gloucester road tube station only a 200 metre walk away. The hotel rooms were a good enough size for two people and had the necessary facilities of tea/coffee making equipement, wireless internet, iron/hairdryer. The continental breakfast was more than adequate in the morning the only criticisim is that the tea was a bit weak. One of the other positives of the hotel was that there was a sainsburys almost next door to the hotel great for the essentials. On refelection this hotel was great for the money, and i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again	
-	Jan 18 2007 	Booked but didn't get to stay there!!	Well, I booked 2 rooms at this hotel, 1 executive king and 1 double last Wednesday hoping to stay on the Thursday. As far as I could see from their website they had rooms available. This hotel was chosen because #1 - it had parking, #2 it was quite close to the Royal Albert Hall where we were going to see Cirque du Soleil.So, we arrive in London thinking all is well. We find the hotel which we thought looked ok even if it was right next door to a hospital.Went inside and the guy at reception said that they had had to let our rooms go as there was a problem with my debit card. Some excuse about there being one digit short. Now, if there was a problem with my card, which I know for a fact wasn't the case I am fairly sure this would have been picked up upon entering the details onto their site.Anyway, the guy said they had tried to call me to let me know. I told him my phone was switched on from 10am and that I didn't have any missed calls and no voice mail message was left. So when we arrive we are non the wiser.He did say they had booked us into their Paddington hotel, If we had wanted to stay in Paddington we would have booked to stay there. He was trying to say it was my fault, but in effect their website is pants, and does not update when they are fully booked!I have since sent 3 emails to the Quality Crown asking for a proper explanation. Have they replied..............well no. So much for customer service!!!In my opinion, if you are looking to stay at this hotel....think again!!	
+	Oct 18 2009 	Location is ideal...service could use some improvement	I just came back from a 5 night stay here. I booked a king contemporary online through their website. First impression when I got off the train at Paddington was that the hotel could not be better located...it is literally just outside the stairs of the Underground and train station...plus buses come/go right in front. Also, there are lots of fast food options like Burger King, McDonald's and KFC right next to the hotel and several grocery/conveneince stores in the train station. The positives of the hotel...the free wi-fi, free breakfast and gym. The wi-fi was reliable and very convenient. The hotel gym had ample equipment and a large tv to watch while working out. The breakfast can be eaten at the attached restaurant or down around the corner where their other hotel (Hotel Indigo) is located...I tried both and have to say the Indigo seemed to have a better spread...typical continental breakfast with croissants,rolls, juice, meats, etc. The negative of the hotel - the room size. They are small, surprisingly small...I was expecting this since it is a European hotel but I was still a bit surprised...I thought a king room would give me a little more room but not really...I could hardly walk around the bed...the desk was small but there was a closet for my clothes...with my 2 suitcases I found myself cramped, and I was alone. The TV was mounted on the wall and had lots of channels to watch. The bed, while a king, is really a double/queen by American standards...it was sufficient though. The thing that bothered me most about the room was the bathroom...it was very clean and the shower pressure was great, but it was cramped and dark...I had a hard time moving around in it and it was dark, even with the lights on. There were just a few small recessed lights and you were always in your own shadow. But, it was clean. My biggest complain overall was the service. Other than the first time when I checked in I really had no interaction with the staff until the day before I left...I walked by the front counter several times a day coming/going and at no time was I greeted...but the day before I left I came back at 2pm to find my room not cleaned...I called the front desk and they said they would have someone clean it right away since they left for the day at 4pm...I left and went to the gym for an hour so I wouldn't be in the way, I wouldn't fit in the room with someone else anyway...I came back at 3pm and the room was still not made up but there were new towels, so someone was there...I called down and was abruptly told by Jenny (front desk) that the reason the room wasn't made up earlier was because of a do not disturb sign on the door (not true) and that this was all they could do as the staff is now gone...I was upset with this reply and asked why I was told they were there to 4pm at which time Jenny rudely told me &quot;I'm not going to explain our internal procedures to you&quot;...which did not sit well with me...as I left for the evening I stopped by the front desk to confront Jenny about her attitude and she was just as defiant in person, which left a lasting impression...while the location is great, I have to believe you could probably do just as well, with better service elsewhere...I wouldn't rule out another stay here as it is very convenient but the rooms aren't cheap and they are very, very small...and the service experience was not ideal. Let me know if you have any questions.	
+	Mar 17 2009 	March in London	We just loved this hotel. The location was the best -- just across the street from Paddington Sta. The #36 bus stopped just outside the door that took us to Marble Arch, Picadilly and Victoria Sta. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. We will stay here again.	
+	Oct 5 2007 	Great location good hotel	Hotel rooms in London are small, so as always I'll get that out of the way straight up. Get out of London proper if you want space, or pay big dollars to stay at the Hilton. My colleague and I had an early morning/late return day trip to Warsaw, so we decided to stay near Paddington Station to make catching the train to Heathrow less painful at 4am.Taken chronologically:Check-in: Don't bother coming early and expecting a room. We got there at 10am and they basically laughed at us. It's always full so rooms just aren't available early. They did, in the end, let one of us check in at 1pm so that I could change for a meeting. But I'd strongly advise you to take check-in time seriously.Rooms: Very well appointed. New beds (in both our rooms), remodelled bathrooms with very nice toiletries and good towels. No bath, but nice shower. Plumbing appears well maintained as I wasn't woken up by neighbours flushing the toilet, as one often is in London. Reasonably priced cabled internet access in the room was welcome. Modern electronic air conditioning and wall-mounted plasma TV. And nice turndown service with a chocolate on the pillow. Sweet touch, and uncommon in all but the priciest hotels in London. Critical? No. But just a nice bit of attention to detail.The only issue I had was that twice during my stay my room key (electronic card) stopped working. I wasn't impressed when I returned from Warsaw at 1am to have to traipse back down to Reception and wait until someone came to fix it. But all things considered it was a fairly minor inconvenience and the room was of a very high quality, although yes very small. Personally I'd call it cozy.Food: Restaurant in lobby looks fine and seemed to be busy enough. But there's so many restaurants, cafes and pubs in the area that the restaurant is sort of irrelevant.Check out: Efficient if not particularly friendly. It's a business as usual place cranking through 100s of tourists every day. Don't expect them to get excited that you're there.Basically if I go to London for work again and don't need an early check-in, I'd consider this hotel very favourably. If I was going for leisure, I'd probably save a bit of money (hey, the Aussie dollar isn't worth that much in GBP!) and stay at the Best Western Paddington Court (see my other review) where I have the option of cooking for myself and still have decent amenities if not quite as nice a bed/toiletries. But in all fairness, the Quality Crown is a nicer hotel and is closer to the station by about 300m which is sure handy with luggage.	
-	May 11 2005	More of the scam	It might be a coincidence, but...Like another user here, I booked a room at the Quality Hotel Paddington over the internet, and, on arrival, was told that they had experienced a power failure on the whole top floor, and would transfer me to their Hampstead hotel. This was at 11pm and I was not best pleased.I shared a cab to the other hotel with an Austrian lawyer who had a very early flight from Heathrow the next morning and who had specifically chosen a hotel near to Paddington in order to catch the Heathrow Express. He was not a happy man.The Hampstead hotel is not in Hampstead, and is, indeed, shabby and cheap-looking; hostel-like. It advertises rooms much cheaper than the Paddington hotel, and so the hotel chain - I assume - makes money by overbooking.The Paddington hotel looked nice - but wandering around Frognall at 11:45pm trying to find something to eat wasn't nice at all. I wouldn't risk it again; and if other people post similar experiences to the ones already mentioned here, I think that Trading Standards might want to look at what this hotel is up to.	
-	Dec 6 2004	Be ware of "hot deals"	My husband and I had booked a room for four nights through the Internet, a special offer. We had been travelling all over Europe, but the first night in this hotel was the worst accommodation we had had - even the Canary Islands 2 star hotel was much better. So our advice is not to check into room 601, this seems to be the only room which is not marked &quot;club room&quot;. It is beside the bar and the persons inside might as well have been in bed with you. In the morning, people seem to gather outside the window for a chat... I nearly stuck my nose into a face when I went to close the window! Fortunately, the next morning when I talked to the desk person, he was very understanding and when we came back from our day trip in London, our luggage had been moved to a club room which was just fine. There were problems with flushing the toilet there as well, though. I usually keep to myself a lot, but my husband agrees with those who praise the bar-tender for his friendly disposition.	
+	Oct 1 2004	Good Value	We had a room for three people at this hotel from the 9th to the 12th September 2004. The room was small but the beds were comfortable. Close to the underground and plenty of eating places around. Good value when you consider the prices and quality of accomodation in inner London. Clean, good bathroom.....we would recommend this hotel.	
+	Oct 30 2009 	not bad for a cheap hotel	I've stayed three nights at this hotel. The room was not that bad. It was clean. Don't expect much from this hotel, but for a cheap stay that's ok. I would stay again	
-	Sep 21 2009	Try the hostels close by	My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights. When we first arrived we were handed our key and we went in search of the room which was on a mezzanine level on the first floor. It was a bit grubby and in need of a good clean and the decoration was tatty to say the least but the bathroom was clean and as we were only there for 2 nights decided it would be ok. That was until that night when we got back to the room and got into the twin beds. You could feel every spring in the bed. it was rock hard and smelt fusty, and the pillow was flat. I tried unsuccessfully to get comfortable and in the end decided that I would ask for a move to another room. &quot;There were no spare rooms&quot;, &quot;there were not staff to move us&quot;, &quot;the hotel was full&quot;, &quot; try in the morning&quot;. These were the reasons we could not have another room. We were given a mattress protector (which smelled fusty) and I asked for 2 more pillows. We were given 1 (thats all they had!!!!!) without a pillow case on and it was stained and smelly. I was told to put it under my existing pillow.I didn't sleep at all and in the morning my back and neck were killing me from the springs in the bed! At reception, I was told by the duty manager (who didnt even look up from his paperwork) that they were full and he was unable to help me. This was a blatant lie as the maids were cleaning numerous rooms and large numbers of people were checking out at the time. I eventualy asked again (this time a young lady who was very helpful) if we could be moved, and the young lady went to plead our case (thats how it felt) with the duty manager, who incidentally didnt come out of the office. After much persuasion on her part he agreed we could have another room on the third floor. So much better - small, but clean and with a comfy bed. Without the young lady virtually begging for us to be moved I fear we would have had to stay in the original room as he could clearly be heard by us as he was saying to the girl, &quot;just tell them we cant help them - we are full&quot;.My daughter has travelled the world and has said that hostel accommodation in some of the countries she has travelled to was better than this hotel. The bed was like sleeping on a bag of rocks and fusty smelling beds are not what I expect in any hotel let alone a british 3 star!!My advice is, if you are staying here, check your room, especially the bed, before you part with your cash and dont bother with the breakfast on offer - try one of the many local places serving breakfast.	
+	Nov 30 2008 	Its ok	After booking the hotel I came across some mostly unfavourable reviews about this hotel. Seeing as there were 5 of us going to London to stay here, me my partner, child 9 years and 2 parents (60+) I was understandably very concerned for our forthcoming 2 nights stay. Conclusion: Its a budget hotel in a great location to get around London. Cheap n cheerful! Yes, it was a bit tatty and in need of some decoration. Yes, the staff were mostly foreign but were not rude, in our dealings at least. The bedding was clean and not aproblem. One morning the hot water was off throughout the hotel, could have been a major issue for this review but it was, as promised, back on for our evening return and what a nice hot shower to have. The breakfast was fine. No bar as mentioned in an earlier review. All in all, if you just want somewhere to sleep and leave your bags all for a cheap price.....Then its fine. You dont go to London to sit in your hotel room, its a good base. If you want the Ritz then get your money out and pay for it.. So the rooms/elevator are small and it seems a bit 'rough around the edges'. Youre paying a small price to stay there compared to other hotels..Its OK !!!!	
-	Nov 14 2008 	Unbelievable!	We have booked this hotel after contacting them by email. They gave us the rates per room per night in written and we were surprised to know when we arrived that they expected us to understand rates change according to the receptionist and day of the week. Their excuses were so childish. The rooms were so tiny and dirty, no hot water, you could not move, the photos on their site have nothing to do with reality.Breakfast is awful and they serve it in a dirty small room that could be ideal for their staff. Be very carefull to get written confirmation as they will drive you mad! Never in my life has such a terrible experience.	
-	Jan 3 2007 	Yet another cancellation	I can't comment on the rooms or anything at this hotel since having booked it online we were told on arrival that our room had been flooded and they couldn't accomodate us. They booked us into a hotel nearby (which incidentally was pretty aweful).Some friends also booked this hotel and the same thing happened - except a faulty boiler was blamed this time.Strange how often this seems to happen when you read the reviews on trip advisor don't you think? Nuff said!	
+	Mar 23 2005	A good place to stay	For a budget hotel,this is great value. The single rooms are small but that's OK. All clean and compact.Breakfast was super in comparison to some other budget hotels that I have stayed in.When I return to London I will definitely stay here again.J.WADELTON, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA	
+	Mar 4 2009 	Great location nice large well appointed room	A perfect location for a weekend in town - walking distance to major shopping areas, West End (theaters), lots of restaurants, cafes and bars. Very friendly and welcoming staff.The room I had was - for London standards - quite large, very well maintained (must have been completely refurbished only very recently) and nicely decorated. Bed was comfortable, noise level from outside negligible (make sure you get a room looking to the courtyard, otherwise you will look onto a fairly busy street). Bathroom was modern, freshly refurbished, had all amenities you would expect, and was perfectly clean.Overall - I definitely would come back and can recommend the hotel without restrictions.	
+	Nov 3 2009 	Hotel was great and staff were very polite and helpful...	The room I had was great (Suite 464) and I syaed for over a month. I had a great view of the GPO Tower (now the BT Tower) - but unfortunately the public are not allowed up the tower anymore. However, the hotel is only a 5 minite walk from Charolette Street - which has some of the best restaurants around and are mostly great value for money. I would also recommend the Italian called Amaretto, just a few door along from the hotel. The hotel is in a great spot nest to all public transport (close to Euston and KingsCross stations) and was perfectly located for my work location at Harley Street. Breakfast is fantastic and the bar food if pretty good too. Drink at the bar are pretty expensive - but most places around London are - although the Northumberland Arm just next to the hotel is very reasonable.	
+	Mar 31 2009 	Excellent stay	Stayed 2 nights last week on business, couldn't fault the hotel, check-in was fine, room was spotless, breakfast excellent with lots of staff clearing tables and bring coffee and toast.One small complaint was price of coffee in bar but there was kettle in room so next time I'll just make one there.Location was excellent for me as I was working in UCLH across the road but also walked to Oxford st one lunch time. Loads of restaurants nearby and I recommend Mondello Italian in Goodge st, very reasonable prices for London.	
-	Feb 15 2009 	Just what you expect from a large hotel chain	Efficient service enhance by super efficient and charming staff. The whole process of arriving and booking in was easy and seamless.The room was immaculate. Stylishly fitted out with all you would expect from a large hotel chain.On the down side, the hotel bar in very expensive. A bottle of beer £5.00 and a gin and tonic £9.00. If you wanted music in your room, that was extra. The room was normal size being no larger than that of an hotel at half the price. At £155.00 for one night B&amp;B the cost was not good value. If you want a nondescript hotel, in a superb location and do not mind paying over the odds, this is the place to stay.	
+	Nov 14 2009 	the kenilworth -great russell st. rocks!!!	i have stayed at the kenilworth regularly since 1984 and have always found it very friendly and welcoming--convenient-good value--recently,due to the new manager and guest relations manager (karthik and kumar) -the level of service is even better-the rooms are great and there is always a friendly welcome-the concierge (usually colm) is always ready with tips and interested to hear what adventure one has had upon returning-i can't say enough about my good experience there!....beth placek ---austin,texas..usa	
+	Aug 5 2009 	Great Location very helpful and very courteous staff.	This hotel is just 5 minutes away from Tottenham Court tube and is only a 10 to 15 min walk to Covent garden and Leicester square. The service is excellent and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was great, filled us us until well earned glass of wine in the afternoon!! Room was really comfortable , but thank goodness for the air conditioning!	
+	May 19 2009 	A no brainer if you'd like a good hotel near Soho	We stayed in another hotel for 5 days, visited two places in Europe (on vacation), and then came back to stay at this hotel for one night before returning home. Our first hotel was fine, but it seemed a bit &quot;nitpicky&quot; in that they charged for every little amenity. (It was on Strand)However, the Radissonal Edwardian Kenilworth was cheaper, nearer to our hangout spots in and around Soho, had free internet downstairs, modern rooms (heated towel racks, nice interiors, international electrical outlets, etc), and a gym. Our room was small (which was to be expected in London), but quite comfortable). The staff was also very helpful (Orbitz failed to send our reservation to them). When we return to London, we'll be looking to stay here again.	
+	Sep 9 2008 	very happy with our 2nd stay	This was the second stay at this hotel. for 4 nights. Yes the rooms are very small, but clean, modern and everything you would need. Hopefully you wouldn't go to LOndon to spend alot of time in your room anyway.Housekeeping was most prompt each time a request was made, rooms were cleaned to good quality. Front desk staff very helpful, as was the concierge. Business centre was good, and with 4 internet computers there was never a wait. Breakfast was delicious, and a great selection. Location is fantastic.Overall very happy once more , and would def stay here again,....depending on rates ofcourse.	
+	Oct 5 2009 	It's the little things unfortunately.....	We booked for £180 per night for 2 nights with an infant and were shown to a pokey room with no bath. I insisted that we have a bath and the concierge obliged. It took them 45 min to find a replacement room and then a further 15 min to check us into the room. By this stage I was furious - holding a small baby for an hour while waiting to check in is simply unacceptable. (The concierge blamed an earlier bomb scare on Leicester Square for the delays)But it was the small things that ruined my stay. In no particular order, these included:1. No robes or slippers in the room2. Fan no working in the bathroom (steamy and stinky)3. No newspapers dropped off in the morning (even though I was asked for my preference once checking in)4. We kept on being phoned by reception - have your trays been cleared - has your room been cleaned etc5. The TV was trying to sell adult channels. Push any button and pleasures of the flesh were for sale. It was a bit too obvious and seedy for this hotel.6. Muffins were soggy on the breakfast platter7. The ketchup on the tables was in the sachets8. The jam on the tables were 3 of the same kind.9. The salt grinder on our table was broken10. Our bill was wrong and we were overchargedIt really does go on and on. If you are still reading - the receptionist's English was so broken that she struggled to give me directions.Great location for sure, but more care needs to be taken.	
-	Feb 10 2008 	Very clean but very small and overpriced	Good points:Great location,Clean and very friendly professional staff.Bad points:WAY overpriced,.Stayed in a king deluxe room on the third floor which was just tiny.The same could be said for the bathroom.No Bathrobes,No minibar and to top it all had only one chair in the room so either me or my wife had to sit on the bed.Would i go back to this hotel.Hell no have been to far better in london and just sort of felt we have been properly ripped off with the whole DELUXE room title.When our sunday morning came we was out the room by 10am due to feeling very clostraphobic.Big tip for a great romantic meal is the Brumus restaurant just off of the strand.Mega quality food and service,Cheers guys.	
+	Jul 20 2009 	Excellent Location and Excellent Hotel	We stayed here recently and cannot say enough about the hotel. The staff were extremely professional and friendly giving advice what to go and see. We stayed in a superior room and were not dissappointed. It was excellent and very spacious.The location was great for the O2, just over the thames. The train station was very close, approx 5 mins walk and canary wharf a couple of stops on the train or about 10 mins walk. Hoping to stay there again in January.	
+	Feb 6 2008 	New Years Eve	We stayed here for 2 nights, for New Years Eve. We got a brilliant deal on Hotels.com £159 for the 2 of of us for both nights! The hotel is very modern and spotlessly clean. We had a lovely room with a large bed and TV. Marble bathroom with a shower and bath, huge mirrow in bathroom and room so you can do your makeup! The bar is very relaxing and chic, modern sofas so you can out your feet up, drinks very expensive, a cocktail is £10 and a large glass of wine was £8! Bar stayed open until 3 am New Years eve, we had late checkout until 1.30, they were supposed to charge £10 per hour an they said they couldnt charge us for the new year - excellent! A little way out of london, you do have to walk 15 mins to the tube, lots of stairs ( not good in hight heels !) . Over all would stay here again.	
+	Sep 22 2009 	Perfect location nice rooms	I visited this hotel last week with my husband and another couple. We had booked two rooms for 2 nights, on BB basis from a travel agent in our country and we were upgraded for free to business class rooms. The receptionists were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious, modern and very clean with king- sized beds and all the amenities you may expect from a 4 stars hotel. The business class rooms include free wi-fi, bathrobes and the wonderful nespresso machine that you will find in every hotel of the Radisson chain. Just make sure to buy water from a kiosk, since it costs 3 pounds per bottle (500 ml) in the hotel. The restaurant was fine and the breakfast buffet was superb for the english standards. The location is perfect! It is very near the hyde park, the Oxford street and the underground station (Marble Arch). I would definately stay there again in a future trip in London.	
-	Nov 18 2007 	Impressive reception for a shabby hotel.	The website is very impressive, thought we'd stumbled across a 'real gem'. First negative aspect was the email confirming my booking (about2 weeks before we visited) informed me that the cancellation policy was like no other hotel I'd booked before, in that you could only cancel up to a month before your visit!!Booked the hotel as we were going to a concert at Ally Pally.Arrived to a highly polished marble reception area and booked in. Ordered a couple of Sunday morning papers and made our way up to our room.The door off the reception looked 'shabby', we opened it and climbed up a 'shabby' badly fitted brown carpet. My heart started to sink. Got to our freezing cold room. What a strange room, looked like was half way through a refurb and the money ran out. The double bed was tiny in length (my 6ft 4' husbands legs hung out the end all night!) and there was no valence covering the bottom part of it, which took my eyes down to the carpet, yuk! The carpet and the curtains were justhideous...reminded me of a dreadful flat I lived in about 20 years ago that was furnished by the landlord. The bath room had a disgusting pink shower curtain hanging around the bath which matched the equally awful dated tiles on the walls (including the cracked ones), When we left the concert we decided to go back to the hotel for a few drinks, the main bar was closed and we were directed to the empty sushi restaurant (part of the hotel) and had a beer each, as they don't sell shorts in here. Another couple came into the bar about 5 mins after us (by this time it was 11.15 on a Sat night) they were told that the bar was now shut!! As we went up to our room another chap was clearly annoyed and complaining about both the hotel bars being shut (by then about 11.30).Breakfast was OK, but not what you expect these days from a decent hotel, there was no buffet spread/croissants or fruit etc. Instead you had to choose from a choice of three options..healthy (cereals etc) cooked or something else. I always get excited about the breakfasts when I'm stopping in a hotel, but this restricted menu wasn't really anything to get excited about.No sign of our papers either.Not overly impressed and wouldn't stop here again if in the area.	
+	Apr 11 2008 	Great value for London	Stayed at this Ramada over the Easter weekend and was suitably impressed. Convenient to central London using the underground, helpful staff, spacious room and modern furnishings. Easy enough walk from the subway station: turn right as you come out of the station, go up the stairs and then walk inbetween the 2 buildings - just follow the path directly in front of you. Tesco Express supermarket conveniently located on your left. Cross the road in front of you and you'll see the red hotel building down the road on the right. Be advised that the wind does gust terribly between the 2 buildings - if you are walking with small children and heavy luggage, it will be a challenge. The wind was strong enough for an adult female to battle to remain upright, so please take this into account on bad weather/windy days. It's a safe area and I was never worried about personal safety. My only minor issue with the hotel room itself was not the noise from above because I honestly didn't hear anything, but noise from the corridor outside my room from an early hour was definitely enough to disturb me. The rolling of suitcases and the maids' carts echoes quite badly - I highly recommend a set of ear plugs if you need to sleep in. Other than that, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Yes, it's not in the centre of London, but so many of the attractions are spread all over the city and you will have to use public transport to reach them in any case. Staying just outside the city centre gives you much better value for money. Please be advised that a taxi ride from Heathrow to the hotel cost approx. £44 - a massive amount for many travelers, especially if you are alone in the taxi and don't have anyone to share the fare.	
+	Sep 19 2004	Lovely suite a long way out.		
+	May 6 2008 	Idéal pour découvrir Londres		
+	Jul 31 2007 	Convenient Location	Got a good deal for a two nights stay here £150 including breakfast which is pretty good for London. I usually stay in Bloomsbury/ Russell Square area but hotels here were either fully booked or too expensive.The location is great - on the main road midway between Notting Hill Gate and Queensway tube station, three minutes walk from each both of which are on the red Central line about five stops from the West End. Kensington Gardens are opposite if you fancy a stroll.Check in was quick and staff were generally polite, lifts were prompt. You can leave your bags after checking out for no extra charge.My request for a non smoking room was not met and though there was no odour in the room, there was a slight smell from the lift down the corridor to my room. The room was clean though slightly cramped but this was compensated by having a wide screen TV with a few satellite channels. The shower was powerful but not piping hot - luckily this was not a problem in July.A nice touch was the complementary bottles of still and sparkling water provided each day as well as the usual coffee, tea, biscuits etc.The breakfast buffet tasted much better than it looked though sadly no fresh orange juice. Tea or coffee is brought to your table immediately. There wasn't a vast choice but it was quite sufficient and you could help yourself to keep you going.It was a pity about the odour in the corridor, having said that I was pleased overall and would stay here again provided The price was right.	
+	Jan 23 2006	Adequate for a single traveller	Stayed in the Ramada Hyde Park for 2 nights in December. The location was pretty good, plenty of bus routes right outside and quite near three tube stations (although Queensway is currently closed). I walked from Paddington Station, which took about 25 mins, not too bad really.I had a single room, which I found quite small. This doesn't really bother me, except the use of the space was not terrific - there was a bit of 'dead' space which made the room feel a tad claustrophobic.The bathroom was adequate, but the shower was pretty bad. I had to let it run for about 5 mins to get any warmth in the water, and then it was only about lukewarm. Not a great welcome to the London Winter!Breakfast was quite good, with plenty of choice of both cold and hot foods. Try and get there earlier though, as I had to wait in a line for a table on both mornings.	
+	Jul 28 2008 	Perfect location good hotel	This hotel was a pleasant surprise. A small hotel in an excellent location with good breakfast and reasonable price. The good: Location between Goodge Street and Tottenham Court Road tube stations in a &quot;quiet&quot; back street, lots of restaurants and pubs right next to the hotel, clean rooms, good English breakfast. In addition the staff were efficient and courteous. The bad: Nothing really if you are OK with typical English hotel. The rooms are small, television is old and everything has a lot of character. However everything is both clean and works.	
+	Jul 25 2006 	good location good hotel good overall	We returned recently from a long weekend at the Rathbone hotel. we found the hotel to be very good. the rooms where big enough for a twin with two large comfortable beds, the bathroom was a little small but big enough for two people. we had complimentary contenital breakfast which we found to be very good and more than enough. the noise from outside was audible from are rooms (above the entrance) but we all slept well and could only hear it from about 9 am. the bar in the hotel is very small and there is no restaurant but there are lots located beside the hotel as well as bars and clubs. we loved the location and the feel of the area. the hotel is located a short walking distance from oxford street (which was good for us as we where there to shop) and had good amenities. the staff where very friendly and helpful however we had problems when we ordered a taxi back to the airport as they where charging us £80 for six people saying we left it to late. however it appears that the charge does not differ no matter how late you leave it and that the porter may have been gaining from this. Apart from this we really enjoyed are stay at this hotel and would return but will order the taxi ourselves instead of asking the porter.	
+	Jan 28 2008 	Best hotel in London	My husband and I stayed a week at the Renaissance in November 2006. It is a wonderful hotel. Hopefully, we will be able to get back to London and would not look to stay anywhere else.The rooms are large and very clean. The toiletries are Penhaglion and are wonderful. The bar at the hotel is very large and comfortable. Great location in Covenant Garden.Highly recommend this hotel.	
+	Jan 5 2008 	Loved Chancery Court	Stayed here on a business trip. Location, Location, Location - absolutely loved the hotel. Plush comfort on the beds. Liked the location and a great place to be when traveling alone.	
+	Oct 6 2009 	A good hotel with some downsides.	My wife and I stayed twice in 2009 (August and then September at the beginning and end of a 7-week vacation). The hotel is convenient, the rooms are quite small but clean, well maintained, and comfortable. The shower is as modern and relaxing as you can ask for. The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast (which for us sets the tone of the day) is a downside, because the breakfast room is simply too small when the hotel is even close to full. It's hard to move without brushing into someone and staff are constantly apologizing for delay -- not a particularly good start. Also, the rooms facing the street are a bit noisy. We can't complain about this and the rooms are OK if you just recognize that you're going to sleep through the noise of the city. It's London, after all, not a B&amp;B in the Alps.With these minor issues, this is still better than other hotels in the area we have stayed at. The owners are doing the best that can be expected given the limited space and the less-than-perfect layout of the building. And if you are willing to deal with the minor downsides, this is something of a bargain, given the location. From our perspective, we just suggest you consider whether a calm, elegant breakfast and a quiet, elegant room are worth, say, an extra 50-70 pounds a night?	
+	Feb 24 2009 	Value for your money	Just came back from London. We were a group of four adults and had two twin rooms. The rooms were almost identical, very small in size, but aren't they all in London in this price category? The other room (mine) was a little bit noisy. It had double glazing allright, so as facing to street we weren't troubled by the street noise, but otherwise we could hear our neighbours talking quite easily. Also our door to the corridor couldn't keep the sound out. Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was small, but big enough and very clean. It had been renewed just recently.We had English breakfast every morning (3 days) which was 3£ extra. That wasn't huge, but good anough to keep the hunger away for several hours.We knew the area before and that was one of the reasons to book the hotel. Two tube lines are very near as well as Heathrow express. It's also fairly short walk to Oxford street - maybe 10 mins. It's a good neighbourhood in any way, so it's quite safe to walk in there. You'll find a few shops and restaurants as well as pubs nearby. I don't know which hotell I will book next time, but for this price I'll definetily take this on my list.	
+	Sep 12 2008 	Small little hotel but good enough...	Hello, My name is Katerina, and I am from Athens Greece. Me, my husband and our daughter aged 7 stayed in Rhodes Hotel for 5 nights. We have just returned.As London is very expensive town, we made a choise not to book something too funcy, but something good enough. After a long search we finally booked in Rhodes hotel and we didn;t regret it. We got a nice fare for a triple room with english breakfast in the price. First of all we wanted a clean hotel. And it certainly is...The hotel itself is housed in an old house with no elevator, (thats a negative). The people run this hotel mr. Christos and his wife Maria are Greeks and very welcome people as the others have mentioned already. I must also say that the gentlemen in the breakfast room (very small) named Haris is very nice and very helpfull. All the staff is.The hotel is certainly in need for a restoration. Its old fashioned.The room also very old fashioned but clean and it has a very nice new bathroom. And as mr. Crias told us all rooms have recently new bathrooms.A small tv, a king size very comfortable bed and pillows, and coffee and tea facilities are big plus in the room.The area is very nice, it has many good restaurants such as ''ask'' around and is close to two tube stations, Lancaster and Padington. A nice five minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel is right next to Hyde park which is very lovely...LONDON is a fabulous town. It has so many things to offer. And if you go with your child together it is probably be a great experience for them. I assure you...Dont forget you are going to spend a lot of pounds here. The London Eye is a must, the acquarium, the Zoo, Little Venice and Gamden Town, Chinatown, The British Museum, The Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, etc, the list is very long. And dont forget the parks and Greenwich..But on top of that we were amazed with Leeds Castle...You, all visiting London you must see it. It is a DREAM. It is almost an hour and a half from London town. It is like time has stopped here.A very romantic and a very unique place with lots of fun for the children. We loved LONDON and certainly RHODES Hotel.Katerina	
+	May 19 2008 	Very good stay @ Rhodes Hotel	A very pleasant stay, very kind personnel and very clean rooms, even if quite small.The proper hotel was full, but they have a &quot;round the corner&quot; building with more rooms to rent.Breakfast is fine, and you don't miss anything. If you want traditional English breakfast, it's about 3 punds more, but it's worth it. Mr.Crias cooks everything with his deliciuos Olive Oil from his farm in Sparta. Internet connection is available and free, and they also allow me to print some documents.Very good location, close to busses and metro, and a step from Hyde Park. Neighboor is fine, and good places to eat are all around. I definetely will go to Rhodes Hotel for my next stay.	
+	Jul 3 2009 	Very helpful hosts and convenient location	Very friendly staff in a great location..London can be difficult in a heatwave essentially being a city designed a couple of hundred years ago. They had a fan in the room to cater for the heatwave like conditions, very helpful as we have a third one tucked into the roaster... Lots of little pubs and restaraunts in the area. Easily accessible from all airports.Thanks to the staff in addition who provided a great Brekky to fuel a long journey that day from LHR..	
+	May 23 2009 	Great Hotel with Great Staff and Great Value	My wife and I had high hopes for this hotel based on the reviews here and were more than satisfied. Our room, although at the top floor was spacious and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and very much like family by the end of the trip. Its hard to know what to say that hasnt been said. Even without a room with a bathroom in it, it was still private and convenient to use the shared facilities. The breakfast was simply amazing, one of the highlights of our entire European trip. Have recommended this already and will continue to until we stay there again! This was the best part of London for us.	
+	Nov 18 2007 	The best hotel in London on a budget!!!!!!	To mirror the sentiments of a previous reviewer, I almost don't want to give the Ridgemount a glowing review because I'm terrified it'll be booked the next time I'm in London.This hotel is all of the following:SpotlessWell managedFantastically locatedExtremely safe neighborhoodThe management is beyond compare, the location is to die for, the rooms are immaculately clean, and the food and service are beyond compare.Last trip we stayed in the Ramada Encore-West which was a very, very pleasant stay, nice decor, great price, friendly staff, and one block away from East Acton station, but it was 15-20 mins from Centeral London by tube and that could be wearing.For the same price, we scored an amazing hotel in the city. I couldn't ask for more and it is the ONLY place I will ever stay in London again - unless price suddenly becomes no object during my lifetime.The Rees Family are very friendly and helpful people and I wish them continued success.The only drawback I think Americans will have is that by most of our standards, the rooms are small. The one issue I think most people, American or otherwise, will have trouble with is that there is no elevator and there are three floors. We were on the third floor and I thought I'd die by the time I got my luggage upstairs.Breakfast every morning is excellent, there's free internet access, TV in room and lounge, free coffee and tea, soft drink machine (only 50p), restaurants all around, a pub around the corner, bus stops across the street and up and down the block, and three tube stations within two-four blocks walking distance. There's also a Boots and Sainsbury's just a few blocks away in case you need anything.They are wonderful people.I highly encourage you to stay here.	
+	Oct 14 2007 	Good Location	Just Return a week ago from London. Ridgemount Hotel is with excellent location, only 15mins walk from theater distric. It also very close to the tube station. Hotel staff is very helpful. The room is a bit small and I think it's a norm in London with mid range level.	
+	Jun 15 2007 	A clean friendly family owned hotel at a great value	This hotel is a joy to stay in. It is not ornate but gives excellent service, clean beds, a great breakfast, and warm friendly helpful staff. They are in a great location near the British Museum in a safeneighborhood with lots of great shopping and places to eat. Internet and tea are free round the clock. Everything is close by.	
+	Jul 19 2008 	Hotel limpio con atención excelente		
+	Jun 24 2005	Fantastic Find		
+	Jun 6 2009 	Average lodging near Paddington station	We stayed at Royal Court Apartment from May 24-28. This apartment is an average type of lodging. It's an old building, and it looks like it needs a paint job. The carpet needs to be replaced. However, the one bright spot is the bathroom has been remodeled recently. The apartment has a full kitchen (refrigerator, microwave, plates, mugs, utensils). It's useful if you plan to buy your food at the supermarket instead of eating out. There is no hair dryer in the apartmentDon't use the phone in the room; they'll charge you 0.25 pounds per minute even if you are using a pre-paid calling card. There is an internet service for 1 pound per 30 minutes.The apartment is 2.5 block from Paddington station. From Heathrow, you can take the Heathrow Express to Paddington station.	
-	Mar 13 2005	Worst Ever	My husband and I stayed at the Royal Eagle the first week in March 2005 and we are just returning. I must say I checked the ratings before going and I read a couple of good reviews on the hotel so I thought we would go ahead and try it. It was part of package from British Airways. This was the smallest hotel I had ever been it. The elevator could only accomodate two people. The bath facilities were a big problem, the shower sprayed water from six feet up all over the bathroom( no bath tub at all). The shower was not adjustable and impossible to use. You could not flush the commode without special pumping before hand. The walls were paper thin.therefore you hear the noise outside, the tube vibrations, and the noise from within the hotel was mind numbing. Continental breakfast (served in the basement) consisted of rice krispies, corn flakes ,bran flakes, bread, coffee and tea. A toaster on the table with the bread was the limit of assistance from the staff. No fruit or fruit juice. The Italian staff was not helpful in any way. Two people could barely move around the hotel room at the same time. The room is so small you can only get in the bed on one side of the bed. This hotel is more of a hostel. It is definitely a two star hotel in my opinion. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that it is clean.	
+	Dec 28 2008 	Lovely hotel in great location - close to tube 	We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for 2 nights whilst visting London for some Christmas shopping and stayed in a delux room on the 7th floor which overlooked the High Street.The hotel is right on Kensington High Street close to the tube station, so it was really easy to find. Check in was smooth and our room was large and very clean. The bathroom was spotless and the bed was super super comfy!We didn't use any of the facilities at the hotel as we were out and about all day but the concierge did look after our cases and shopping bags after we had checked out as we were not leaving until the evening!This hotel was lovely, very impressive looking and in a great location, we had a very enjoyable stay!	
+	Jun 22 2008 	a wonderful stay	We stayed for one night at the Royal Garden Hotel as we were going to the Royal Albert Hall, which was five minutes walk up the road. The staff couldn't have been friendlier. Check in was quick and efficient and we were taken to our Junior Suite by the receptionist. We had a nice room with a separate seating area. There was a side view towards Kensington Gardens. The bathroom was a decent size with White Company toiletries. We had a Champagne Afternoon Tea which consisted of a glass of champagne, strawberries as well as the usual sandwiches, cakes and scones. There were also several different teas on the menu. As it was also my husband's birthday this was a very good experience. The bed was very comfortable and the next morning we had a good breakfast, including fresh fruits, pastries, cereal and a cooked breakfast. Check out was equally efficient. A wonderful stay for the two of us.	
+	Jun 19 2007 	A nice stay but definitely not 5 star	Stayed for two nights as we were going to the Albert Hall. This hotel is ideally located for the Albert Hall being 10 minutes walk away. It is ideally located for Kensington Gardens and Kensington High Street.The room on the 9th floor was spacious and clean with a large and very comfortable bed. The TV was a bit on the small size as a lot of quality hotels have larger flat panel units these days. No tea or coffee in the room but this can be supplied if you ask.Breakfast was very good with good selelction of hot and cold dishes and the service was good.Overall the hotel is in need of a bit of an up-grade and up-date to get it to 5 Star level as it is looking a bit tired; the location is good though.	
+	Aug 2 2009 	An excellent stay in elegant surroundings - first class	I stayed here recently on an overnight theatre trip. The rooms are modern with every little luxury you could want - robes, tv in the bathroom, ipod dock etc etc. The breakfast had plenty to offer from a selection of hot and cold. Although the drinks are expensive, I guess this is what you would expect in a 5 star London hotel. The location just off Whitehall is very handy for the London Eye, the West End and the London bus tour stops. Considering we were in London it was incredibly quiet. Overall, a very good experience - I will be back!	
-	Feb 13 2007 	Good location but wouldn't recommend it	The location of this hotel is fantastic. Our room had good views of the London Eye and the Thames. However for a 4 Star hotel I was very surprised at the quality of the room. The bed was shocking, extremely uncomfortable and even had a couple of (presumably broken) springs poking throught the mattress and the duvet cover did not look particularly clean. The rest of the room was tired looking and draughty and there was clearly a damp problem judging by the amount of wallpaper hanging off. The bathroom was on the grubby side, but functional. Having read comments about non-smoking rooms we had phoned the hotel direct on the morning of our arrival date to request a non-smoking room and on arrival guess what... it was a smoking room! But did not smell very strongly so we stuck with it. Breakfast was good, as was the location, but I'm sure there are better hotels in the vicinity - I wouldn't recommend it!	
+	Aug 24 2006 	Good London Hotel	Im not sure whether some previous reviewers have been unlucky or have stayed at a different hotel as I have just returned from this hotel and cannot find any fault whatsoever.It must be remembered that this is a London hotel and therefore it follows that it will be expensive. The other point to note is that it is a very old historical building and therefore the hotel has been made to fit the building. All the rooms will be different and it may be potluck as to which room you receive. We had two rooms and both were spacious, well maintained and very well appointed.The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. I did notice that a few people were being very obnoxious and loud at reception and they were dealt with in a professional and courteous way. I believe that if you treat people with respect then they tend to look after you and treat you they same way. We were given free upgraded rooms when we explained that it was one of our parties birthday. It is little touches like that that make hotel stays special.I am not sure about previous comments regarding the breakfast not being fresh as the food was constantly being replenished. We arrived 20mins before the end of breakfast and food was still being brought out well after the stated finish time. If you asked for anything different to the breakfast buffet they were happy to provide it.Location wise the hotel is excellent, in the centre of London yet away from the crowds. It is 5 mins to Trafalgar square on foot and directly opposite the London Eye. Harrods will take you 10 mins in a taxi and the nearest underground station 2 mins walk. Perfect for a short break to see the sights.	
-	Sep 11 2009 	The worst hotel we have ever stayed in	The group messed up our booking and sent us to the Royal National. Despite our request for a disabled room near the lift due to my partner's mobility problems, we were given a dirty room at the end of a very long corridor at least a 4 minute walk from the lift. The decor was shabby, the mattresses were filthy and the last refurbishment appeared to have been in the 50s. Breakfast has been described by others as like a school canteen. This is grossly unfair to school canteens. A prison camp may be a more accurate description.The hotel was full of tourists from all over the world and it is an embarrassment to Britain that this place even exists under the guise of a hotel.	
+	Apr 27 2008 	Wasn't As Bad as We Expected	My friend &amp; I stayed at the Royal National for a total of 4 nights in May 2004 before and after our Contiki trip. After booking the hotel through Contiki (the tour leave from the hotel) we read the reviews on Tripadviser and freaked out!! We tried to change our accommodation but would've lost all our money so we prepared for the worst!We flew in at 6am to Heathrow from Sydney and were tired and exhausted but took the tube on the Picadilly line straight to Russell Square station. Beware the 195 stairs! Take the lift to the street! It was a short walk to the Royal National, passing the Tesco across from the station. Walking up the street, our first impressions upon entering the courtyard was OMG this place is MASSIVE and so DEPRESSING looking! The foyer was quite pleasant though. After being told we couldn't check in until 2pm, we left our luggage in the luggage room.Despite dying for a shower and food, we saw the queue out the door of the Windsor breakfast room &amp; after hearing about the terrible breakfasts, didnt want to risk it so decided to go for a walk. We found the shopping complex past Tesco and the Carluccio cafe chain. Thankgod for Carluccio's is all i can say! We had breakfast there every day for our stay (even though we had breakfast included in our accommodation!) best italian coffee &amp; pastries and a deli with meats &amp; cheeses &amp; breads so you could buy to make sandwiches for your lunch. We then went back towards the hotel &amp; got on a Big Bus Tour which leave from outside the hotel and cost us 18 pounds. It takes you via various routes around the city to all the tourist attractions and you can hop on and hop of f when you feel like it. It was an absolute god-send and we proceeded to spend the next 4 hours on the bus going around the city. Good way to waste time when you are tired &amp; jet lagged &amp; lets you get your bearings of the city.Soon it was 1pm, headed back to hotel &amp; checked in with about 200 other people! Yes the hotel is busy &amp; full of students but suprisingly, also full of people who were 60 years plus! After we finally found our room and to be honest, it was in a pretty good state. Yes its old and needs refurbishing, but everything was spotlessly clean - first thing we did was pull back the bed covers &amp; inspected the sheets and they were clean! Bathroom was also clean with running hot water! Tv worked. Beds were comfortable and there is enough room for your bags (which we never unpacked). We did notice no hairdryer (mine blew up upon first use) and so we went to reception and were told to go to house keeping. After getting lost, we found it &amp; were shocked at the 20 pound deposit!!! we got an old dryer but at least it worked!First night we slept like babies due to the jet lag, but in the morning we were woken at 5am by slamming doors and a tour bus leaving in the courtyard which our room overlooked. We had breakfast out and spent the rest of the day sightseeing and only returned to our room at night. Our rooms were clean. The hotel has internet terminals for a fee downstairs on the north side of the hotel though the connection isnt that great! 2nd night was harder sleeping as you notice the sirens every half hour or so, the hotel is in the Hospital zone of London, but you get used to it. We luckily must've been on a quiet floor as there wasn't one party in the hallway the whole time of our stay! The rest of the stay was pleasant. Prior to leaving on our 2 week tour I checked a backpack of souveniers into the luggage room for 2 weeks (for a fee, about 50 pence a day i think) thinking i'd never see it again!I was happy &amp; suprise after returning 2 weeks later it was still there!! We stayed 1 more night and organised the night reception to book us a transfer to stanstead airport for 5am the next morning. Staff were helpful. Next morning the transfer was waiting for us at exactly 5am. Overall, our stay at the Royal National was good. Hotel is in a fantastic location, it felt safe walking around at night, plenty of restaurants nearby, tescos and waitrose close and a shopping centre and most of all the price is fair for what you get. It meets all your basis needs provided you don't expect 5 star luxury! and yes you do get sick of seeing so many people around but you have to be tolerant when travelling!I would stay there again if on a budget :)	
-	Dec 8 2008 	? hmmm Think I'll say get what you pay for	Me and my partner stayed here for a couple of nights to have a xams break....The good.Staff at check in were polite and helpfullThe location for Paddington station was brilliantThe BadMy partner went to grab a breakfast coffee on the first day (I was still getting ready), now he is not fussy (at all) but when he returned he put me and him off for the duration of our stay, mainly the quality of food/cutlery but also queues, too close to each other at tables - we got some lovely stuff in town insteadThe hotel is in DIRE need of renovation - the stairs are warped from, I can only assume decades of use - the carpets are old/fusty - the screws holding the carpets down to aforementioned stairs are not doing their job, lol. - The lighting all over the place is similar to the Tower of Terror at Disney .The door frames need stripping and repainting and, I know I'm being fussy now, but none of the interior matched - all felt like a botched job!The room, now where do I start....... size I can deal with - but a 4 inch step into a wardrobe bathroom, where my 6 foot partner could barely squeeze in, not so much. A 4th floor room with the old wooden frames and single sheet glass that literally howls the icy wind and local sound effects through, not for me either. The fact the bed actually leans to one side so my partner slept on me, &amp; the manky fur throw rug that we thought was decorative - but alas for for heat on the bed! Hmmmmm not goodAlso - maybe just when we stayed - but the lift was permenantly broke - so a 4th floor room = Two flights of stairs upOne zig zag landing through 2 sets of doorsTwo flights of steps down (yes down)One more small landingThree flights of double (warped) steps upThen through the 2 magic doors to our roomPhew.........Try doing that after a day on foot/tube + Harrods and Selfridges bags of shopping LOL We basically got a hotel, near a tube, that was as practical as a safe in a tent - if that's for you - be my guest.We will pay extra next time R x	
-	Oct 1 2008 	AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS	Stayed at this hotel prior to flight from Heathrow the following day. Chose it because of its close proximity to Heathrow Express from London Paddington.This hotel is a disgrace. Carpets worn and smelly. Didnt have any sleep at all because the bedroom &quot;shook&quot; every 3/4 mins with the underground trains. Would have had a better nights sleep on a bench in Hyde Park. Just what you need before a long flight the following day.On leaving, put our cases in the lift and the lift got stuck,. Rang the alarm bell 5 times and Reception just ignored our calls. in the end carried them down the stairs ourselves - with a struggle.Breakfast a shambles.Room small, smelt, w/c shower small even for a cat.Staff were rude and offhandStay at this place at your peril	
-	Aug 19 2007 	Not impressed	We found the hotel room clean but with dated mismatched furniture. The bathroom was tiny, barely room to stand under the shower, and smelt unpleasant. Coming down to breakfast on the first morning we entered the dining room only to be told to wait outside as there was no room, we waited outside for about ten minutes before finally being allowed in. Breakfast was ok except on the last day when they ran out of bacon and we were given cold watery waferthin ham instead. The carpets in the hallways were filthy - the only pleasant thing about our stay were the reception staff who although ineffectual were very friendly. This hotel was advertised as a 3 star I can't believe it meets this standard. Would not book here again.	
+	Oct 23 2007 	Loved this little boutique hotel!	I did extensive research on this site for hotels in London and had originally booked at a Best Western in Kensington. I'm so glad that I cancelled that reservation and booked a room at the Royal Park. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's right by both the Paddington and Lancaster Gate Tube Stations which makes it so easy to get everywhere in London. The staff at the front desk were so helpful. They gave us great suggestions where to dine and one of the staff even allowed us to borrow his personal laptop to access the internet. The room was very tiny but beautiful and comfy. I think the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom was all marble and immaculate. The shower had great water pressure. We especially loved breakfast in bed and the yummy hot chocolate and warm croissants. I hope to stay here again the next time we go to London.	
+	Oct 5 2009 	A very nice British hotel near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station	We stayed the weekend at this older hotel, and found the staff eager to go out of their way to be helpful. Our room was unusually shaped and looked cramped, but it actually had space for all of our 'stuff' (we were wrapping up a two-week trip to the British Isles). After much hastle, we did get the Internet going, but sporadically, even after the manager on duty personally tried to help. Our 'package' included a three course &quot;carvery dinner&quot; the first night, a delightful prime rib of roast beef dinner with all the trimmings. The breakfast buffet was also quite good, and they had a very unusual way of cooking the eggs to just the right degree of doneness. Tom the concierge was expertly knowledgable and very helpful, but service from that desk fell off during his days off, unfortunately. But we would stay here again.	
-	Aug 2 2006 	overpriced	It was fine and the air conditioning was great and William the concierge couldn't have been nicer .... I booked so that breakfast was included and upon checkout, they had charged us $70 a day --my young son had 2 bites of potato which certainly wasn't worth $35 a day! So I complained and they removed the breakfast charge.I read the other comments and I don't disagree with them -- but we payed about $400 a night and at that price I was very underwhelmed--- for $150 a night, it would have been great.	
+	Sep 14 2005	Good value with some ever-so-slightly rough edges	The Rubens is distinctive both in its character and location. It's the only London hotel that can claim to be 'across the street' from Buckingham Palace, and both its exterior and interior radiate Victorian charm.The staff is uniformly very friendly and helpful, and the bars and restaurants are comfortable and pleasant. Though expensive.I stayed in a 'superior double' facing the Palace -- you literally pay for this view, with a £10 surcharge.My smallish room was pleasantly decorated, though not 100% up to snuff -- the sink and tub drains were partially blocked, for instance, and one light was non-functional. And yes, as others have noted, the floors are creaky :)But for the money I was very satisfied with the Rubens. I have paid more, and gotten less, at other London hotels.	
+	Aug 17 2009 	Muy contento en este hotel		
+	Jun 2 2008	Great cheap(ish) find :)	Booked direct with hotel , day before for £125 per night with full english breakfast, upgraded room to an ambassador for free.Room was spacious, air conditioned, clean, first floor with a balconey.Hotel was perfectley situated, 20 min walk to oxford street. 2 tubes within walking discount, (5 min and 7 min) and the bus stopped right by the hotel (no 188) that goes to o2 arena, took exactly one hour.Breakfast was adequate with a good amount of choice available.Only gripe was the noise from the main road, it is a very busy road, all day and night. Personally i would ask for a room higher up than the 2nd floor, and preferably at back of hotel, otherwise i would definately stay here again, as two women travelling alone, walking back from tube, bus to o2 etc, it felt perfectly safe, and we rounded the evening off with a great curry the first night from restaruant 3 min walk down the road, or the meal in the hotel 2nd night.	
-	Sep 15 2006 	Staff could have been more happier.	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights booked into a single room went for the modern design look paid extra for this. Room very nice but small ,air conditioning wasnt working informed the staff nothing done about it,mentioned this again on checking out and got £60 off the bill. Breakfast very nice , plenty of choice. Location of this hotel is very good ,all the main attractions are close by.The main problem with this hotel is some of the staff look very sad and they appear not to want to help you its a real shame as this could be a really nice place to stay .	
+	Jan 22 2006	Russell is Memorable!	A stay at the Russell is memorable! We were particularly pleased with the courtesy of the staff, especially those at the front desk who were very gracious about a booking error by our booking agent and offered us our choice of other rooms. The hotel interior is beautiful and the location in Bloombury, right around the corner from the tube station, couldn't be better. It's also within walking distance of the British Museum. The rate including breakfast is a good deal for what you get, as breakfast separately can be expensive. The renovated rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds and linens, towel warmer, etc., and ours had a great view of Russell Square. The history of this fine old hotel is also interesting. Virginia Woolf and friends used to hang out here, though the hotel pub named for her was closed when we were there. We plan to stay at the Russell whenever we are in London!	
-	Dec 5 2005	Disappointing	I have just come back from a 3 night stay at the Rydges and I must say I don't agree with the reviews on this site.I had booked a single room and when I saw it I couldn't believe how small it was, I complained and they said that was of the biggest single rooms they had. In fact they showed me another one and it was even smaller!They did concede that they get complaints about single rooms all the time but there is nothing they can do about it. Fair enough but I will not go back.So if you are a single traveller definitely look elsewere.	
+	Nov 26 2007 	Good Choice might stay again but London has soo much choice	I read the many reviews before me just like you and decided to go with it. The cons were not all that bad, mostly from people who had too high expectations.I didnt have high expectations but I have standards and this hotel easily met them.Let me start by saying: The halls do not stink. We even took special note of the fact the 12th floor smelt of lavender.The lifts do have a mind of their own. The doors close very quickly and unless you press the open door button your partner or fellow guest is locked out. Putting your foot in the door, I learned, does not stop the door. The lift sometimes decides which floor it would like you to stop at. I figured this was because somebody on the floor it stopped at pressed the call button and got on another lift or stairs but no, its just felt like stopping there or bypassing your floor and stopping further up.Do you know what? They were the only complaints. The bathroom door would not lock but we always knew when the other person was having a &quot;private moment&quot; to not open the door. The main door was a bit broken whereby the lock was slightly askew from the deadbolt. It still worked after a bit of jiggling.The room was a good size, big bed, 28&quot; LCD tv with around 80 channels. Im aware you dont go to London to simply watch TV but with my Fiancee's bad back, sometimes we need to stay in.The bar and restaurant on the 15th Floor have amazing views and the continental breakfast is satisfactory. It does exactly what it says on the tin. I think £15.95 for a hot breakfast is a lot to pay anyway. We never had dinner but the prices seem reasonable with £10.95 a main course + a glass of wine or dessert.The staff are friendly and helfpul and even took the time to answer my strange query on where the 13th floor went. Reason, the hotel reception is on the ground floor but the hotel starts from the 9th floor and up. 13 does not exist and all the way to 15. The BBC occupy the first lot of floors with a canteen on the ground floor next to reception.They have parking out front for 4 cars!! LOL but have a reduced rate in a multistorey around the corner.The hotel does need a facelift but from the inside it makes no difference. It you want a fancy hotel, stay across the road in the 5&quot; star place. Its looked nice but with 3 doormen it looked expensive. Its an old 70's type building.Location: Thumbs up. We walked from the hotel down to the start of the shopping streets in less than 5 minutes. Oxford Circus is the nearest tube on the shopping street 5 minutes. This circle line goes Everywhere(nearly).I have attached loads of photos, well as many as Im allowed to.Would I stay again? Maybe. Its great and all that but there is soo much choice, I might save money and stay out by Bayswater/Queensway again.Questions. Quirke.alan@gmail.com	
-	Jan 31 2009 	The dirtiest rooms ever!	We picked this hotel as a birthday treat, as we were seeing a show up town. Our first impressions were good as the reception looked modern and smart, but that was as good as it got! Wewent to our extremely small room (almost a large cupboard in fact) only to find the key had not been programmed so we couldn't get in! When we had sorted that, my first look round the room showed it to be quite unclean, and everything seemed to be covered in dust. The carpet looked as though it hadn't been vacuumed for some time !! Then my girlfriend decided to use the loo. To our horror there was hair and urine on the seat. I phoned the receptionist to complain, and was told they would send a cleaner up !! I asked for another room instead. The receptionist was very apologetic and understanding, I have to say. We were moved to another room, and once again we couldn't get in as the key wasn't programmed again! Finally we were in a new room but to our dismay the bathroom was just as dirty as the last, minus the urine! Hairs all over the floor and very dusty. A nice young chap did come to the room with wine and fruit, and we showed him the bathroom. He started to clean the floor with a napkin, but we stopped him as we didn't think it was down to him to have to do that. It took the shine off our mini trip. When you pay £78 for a room you would at least expect it to be clean. We were given complimentary breakfasts, valued at £14.95. Believe me, it isn't worth that !! We would not stay nor recommend this place to anyone. It was quite disgusting !!	
-	Jul 6 2005	I write what I see....	My friend and I went to London on 9th June, 2005. We have booked Hyde Park Paddington Hotel via Internet. Same problem: they couldn't find our name in the system, and luckily we brought our confirmation letter with us. We finally get a room in the ground floor. However, it was extremely hot (even the heater was on). We asked for the fan --- every 30 minutes. What you get is the answer: we will give it to you in a min. But this minute seems like forever. Nobody was trying to help us and it was sooooo hot. My friend and I were decided to go out for some fresh air. After we came back from the dinner, we reminded the receptionist again. Still, we cannot get anything.Overall, the room is tidy, tiny and comfortable. (for Asian size). However, if you were asking the good customer service, please choose another hotels.	
+	May 27 2009 	The Sheraton Belgravia in London is fit for a queen.	Wow, a friend and I just returned after a delightful week's stay at the Sheraton Belgravia, ideally situated across from a key park in the embassy area of London. It was beautifully appointed with antiques in our room and lobby. We were within walking distance of the Chelsea Flower Show (our main destination), Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. The hotel has an excellent chef from Argentinia, who created some memorable dishes, including the guiney pie and peach torte, which were especially delicious! The concierge Gregors was always available to help with directions, money exchange and transportation needs. The housekeeping staff was also excellent, tidying up each day. We will definitely return for our next visit.	
+	Oct 9 2009 	Good solid stay  mostly positive and neutral no real negatives	+tive great location, cannot underscore how much it matters that you are a few minutes away from the tube, Harrods, good restaurants, etc (especially when it is pouring in London)+tive smooth check in, good concierge, ample supply of umbrellas+tive adequate gymneutral - Room size for families but most London hotels are the same so not a negative, view was great-tive breakfast was very expensive even on expense travel	
+	Apr 13 2008 	Lovely hotel good location!	We stayed for just one night in late March and really enjoyed or stay. The most comfortable hotel beds we've experienced for ages. The staff were all efficient and courteous and the decor was lovely. I especially liked the Rose Lounge where we had afternoon tea!Very close to St James' Park, Piccadilly etc etc. Would definitely stay here again when we next visit central London.	
+	Oct 22 2007 	Wonderful base in London	Having stayed in Sofitels in France and liked their style and extremely comfortable beds we decided to try Sofitel St James, and have just been back for the second time. The location is superb for theatres, opera, upmarket shopping and art galleries yet just away from the main crowded areas, in a former bank on Waterloo Place overlooking Pall Mall and historic statues. The largely French staff don't seem to mind the address and on both our visits have been friendly, welcoming and helpful. If you arrive by car the concierge service offers valet parking (£40 for 24 hours). Check in and out very efficient.The style is quietly modern, black &amp; chrome and glass feature strongly, the bedrooms and bathrooms offer everything you would expect with impeccable standards of cleaning.Minibar prices as usual are punitive, but we tend to avoid them anyway. The bar and restaurant (Brasserie Roux) are undeniably expensive but of high quality and Central London prices are high generally. We shall be back.	
+	Aug 12 2006 	Great location nice room and helpful staff	We had a very nice experience at the Sofitel St. James. We booked the &quot;Dream Package&quot; which included a bottle of champage, 2 hours with a chauffeaur, a lunch or dinner from set menu (food was 5 stars) and english breakfast included which is easily a $80 value (per breakfast) and it can be room service too. The staff was very helpful. William, the concierge, gave us some great recommendations for dinner. The check in staff was very helpful and friendly. The location is awesome if you plan to go the theater. The location is also great for a walking tour of Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace.	
+	Sep 7 2005	Great Hotel 	Just returned from a long weekend stay in London. It was our first time in London, and we found the hotel to be very centrally located to almost everything we wanted to see. Hotel staff and service were excellent. Concierge made excellent dinner suggestions. Try Foliage and The Square for top dining. Our suite was roomy and very well appointed. We will definitely return!	
+	Jun 14 2007 	Great little spot	Delighted to have found this great place which for us made the perfect bolthole in London. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was a bit on the small side but well laid out and had everything we needed. Great opportunity to visit the nearby Borough Market with plenty of stuff for foodie fans and there were plenty of cafes etc for eating just over the road and around Southwark Bridge. Two mins walk. St Paul's etc very walkable too. Made a change to be staying in a part of London that wasn't in the heartland of tourist hotels. Will return	
+	Nov 17 2005	near the tate modern	A great hotel at a great price (buy via lastminute) very convenient for the tate modern 5 minute stroll along the thames. The room was modern very clean and had everything we needed. As with alot of hotels the breakfast is overpriced if you just want the basics - but you can get that somewhere else.	
+	Mar 29 2007 	We were treated like family!	I was impressed with the high rating that St. David's maintains onTripAdvisor. Being a first timer in London, I was happy to be able to find this hotel easily. The three of us had flown into Heathrow, taken the Heathrow Express and arrived at Paddington Station. From there, St. David's is a few minutes' walk. Knowing that we could get to/from the Tube or trains within minutes was a stress reliever. The area is always busy with commuters riding the Tube and BritRail trains. Paddington Station has all kinds of shops for people on the go and two grocery stores with convenient hours. Also, Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park are nearby for nice walks. After reading the many favorable reviews and seeing the photos of staff at St. David's, meeting our hosts was like finding long lost relatives. Alex, the owner's son who works at reception, is charming. After a warm welcome, George, the owner, announced he would cook us breakfast although breakfast was officially over. It was a real bonus because we were too early to check in and were exhausted from a long flight. All we had expected was to stow our bags and come back later. The full English breakfast kept us going until the afternoon. Foula, George's wife, and the attentive staff serve everyone cheerfully in the dining room. I spent a total of three nights at St. David's, one week apart. The rooms are tight and sometimes the en suite toilet and shower stall are even tighter, but clean and adequate. The beds were firm and I did notice the plastic mattress covers that were noisy. However we slept well after long days of sightseeing. Yes, the stairs were numerous so we asked for help with our luggage. For our purposes, due to clean facilities, convenient location and good value, we were quite satisfied with this hotel. The owners and staff will treat you well.	
+	Jan 16 2007 	Easy and friendly	We stayed here for 2 nights in a twin room overlooking Norfolk Square. It was nice enough. Our room was comfortable and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was awesome. It's in a nice, safe, and convenient location, just 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station. My only complaint was that my ensuite WC smelled horribly of a combination of urine and mildew on check-in, and never improved. So we had to keep that door closed all the time.The shared bathrooms looked nice though, so it's probably not worth it to pay the extra money for an ensuite. Even so, I'd stay here again because the location can't be beat.**Tip: If you're looking to save money, Paddington station has a Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury's grocery store in it, so preparing a picnic meal from one of those is much cheaper than going out to one of the many pubs/restaurants nearby.	
+	Aug 22 2009 	hotel correcto y limpio		
+	Mar 15 2009 	central location	I have stayed in this hotel last year and had no prblem in booking it again.Yes the rooms are small but our room was clean and warm.It is close to the shops in Oxford street.It is a typical city centre hotel and if you want luxury you have to be prepared to pay extortionate prices for it.I would suggest that they look at the breakfast room No toast!!!and we felt a bit rushed and not able to relax.	
-	Jun 8 2008 	Great Location...not the best night's sleep	We were a bit concerned having read some of the other reviews, but also aware that people have different standards and expectations of hotels. You could not have got a much better location for the price, we came out of Tottenham Court Tube station and could see the sign straight away. We checked in with no problems and went to our room on the 7th floor. The room was very small but it is the centre of London so to some extent we weren't suprised. The bathroom was extremely small with barely enough room to turn around. One of the main problems was the heat. The room was baking hot, with no air con but we did have a fan which we had to have on every night (and it isn't even proper summer yet!) The bed was small as was the tv, but we didn't spend a lot of time in our room so it wasn't a major issue. We had a drink in the bar downstairs, The Lazy Dog, and other than London prices it was a nice bar. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel even thought it was included, nor did we eat there but that was just because we were in London and wanted to go out.We found it useful to get 3 day tube tickets, and couldn't believe it when on the fourth day we had to pay nearly the same amount for a day on the three day ticket just for a single trip to Kings Cross.Overall not a bad hotel but definitely not the best or the biggest!	
+	Aug 25 2007	Better than expected	I stayed in the hotel with a friend for three nights last week. We had been planning a trip to see Grease in Picadilly Theatre and this hotel was listed as being very near the theatre. I had read the reviews on this site and I have to say I was very worried about what the hotel wouold be like. I can now say that I need not have worried at all. When we arrived, the check-in was speedy and we were in our room within ten minutes. We stayed in a deluxe twin room, which was small yet spotless. The staff were extremely friendly and did everything they could to help us and make our stay enjoyable. Breakfast was lovely and you could have as much as you wanted of a variety of foods. We had dinner in the hotel restaraunt on the last night of our stay and it was delicious and very reasonably priced. Even though we were near to the road the room was very quiet and we had no trouble sleeping. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a central base which is near to all amenities.	
+	Jun 7 2008 	value for money	The time I was planning to book a hotel in Earl's court, I was scared of the comments I've read which I don't think it's helpful to evaluate this very nice hotel.First of all, the staff were helpful, they asked me which floor I like and they offered helping me with the bags as I'm less abled. Their welcome was friendy and warm. Having checked in, the front desk rang to make sure everything was ok.The room was spotlessly clean, the breakfast was more than excellent for a budget hotel.whenever I asked for help or directions, they were always helpful.I will definitely book this hotel the next time and I do recommend it to anybody wants to enjoy a holiday.	
+	Jul 28 2005	amazing	believe nothing these strange people write, obviously they stayed in the standard rooms, for standard people. this hotel is amazing, i will recommend it to anyone	
+	Jun 15 2009 	Close to the center clean great value for that money	This is perfect choice if you would stay only for a couple of days. It is very close to the center, I didn't pay anything for travelling in London. The staff is incredible friendly!!!! The traditional English breakfast was a big surprise. You should know before booking that there is no lift and fridge in the rooms, but anyway, it wasn't said in the description of hotel.	
-	Jul 18 2006	Horrible Horrible	We were traveling through Europe with a group of 14 which included family and friends and London was our last stop before going home. Our group had booked four months in advanced. We asked for lower rooms as we had small children and a grandparent as we knew that climbing stairs would be an issue (most small hotels have no elevator). On arrival we only got one room on the lower floor all the other rooms were on the 3rd and 5th level. We only stayed two nights. On the last day of our stay the receptionist woke up everyone in our party at 5:00 o'clock in the morning to come down and pay our bill. This hotel was a real let down. We have been to London before and had stayed at another hotel right around the corner from this hotel, and we were very happy there. I do not know why we switch hotel. The receptionist and rest of the staff were very rude. When one of our party asked to see a newspaper the receptionist said this was not the RITZ. This hotel was cheap and the service was lousy. I guess we did get what we paid for.	
-	Jun 29 2009 	Great location disappointing hotel/	We paid more for this hotel than some others we'd seen because it looked like a lovely hotel in a great location. The location is very good, close to all the centre sights and very near to Covent Garden and CG tube. The rooms, although they have been refurbished, are small and dingy - we were in a King Size Double, so the standard rooms must be very small. The staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean. The breakfast is not very good, it has all the usual stuff but it not all hot or well prepared and the staff are constantly crashing crockery around and clearing all around while you are trying to eat. Even though the service was meant to be finished at 10.30 in one of the breakfast rooms, they were clearing all the food away and relaying the tables for lunch by 10.00 which made people still eating feel rather unwelcome. We were also astonished to have to pay for the cases to be watched for an hour while we went for a final wander round after check out. As someone else has said, its not the money, but when you have paid for a decent hotel, it seems a bit mean of them - a bit like the budget airlines. Overall, not the best hotel I've ever stayed in and I wouldn't want to go there again.	
-	May 25 2009 	Never Again!	Stayed here recently for 3 nights on a short business/leisure stopover in London.I've stayed in some pretty average hotels around the world, but this one has to take the cake. When I checked in (pretty late at night), everything seemed well and good. The staff were friendly, the place looked nice. Got to my room, that looked good as well. Not a bad size for a London hotel room given what I paid (100 quid a night on Expedia including breakfast). The bathroom was nice, big deep bath and good water pressure in the shower. The breakfast in the downstairs dining room was decent.Going to sleep that first night, I thought the hotel was pretty good. Only when I woke up in the morning, I had a really really nasty red rash ALL OVER my body. Now I know hotels have bed bugs, but I have never suffered this badly (and I was wearing long sleeved PJ top and long PJ pants!). It was horrible. I mentioned it to the hotel reception and they said it had nothing to do with the hotel and maybe I'd come into contact with something I was allergic to...Yeah, their beds! I slept on top of the blanket the next 2 nights and still suffered. Amazingly enough the rash disappeared the day after I checked out.This ruined what would have otherwise been a pretty good stay at the hotel.	
+	Sep 24 2008 	highly recommended!	I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my boyfriend on our way back from Venice. I found the hotel location excellent and the staff most welcoming and eager to help. We normally stay around Paddington when we visit London but we thought we'd pay the little extra and stay in a much more central location. The hotel is walking distance o Westminister Abbey, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, China Town and Covent Garden. Check-in was simple and smooth and we were quickily directed to our room. Our room was a little on the small side but very standard for London, we were fully impressed by the size of the bathroom (which even had a full size tub...a rareity in London hotels of this price range!) The staff concierce desk were polite, full of information and could answer all our questions. Breakfast was the best I have had in a hotel. Full hot and cold buffet breakfast where there was plenty of wait staff however there was a bit of a queue on Saturday cause the hotel was packed but we still manage to stuff ourselves!Highly recommended, I will definitely book to stay there again on my next visit to London.	
+	Sep 23 2008 	Unexpectedly Pleasant!	Having read some of the reviews of the Strand Palace Hotel on Tripadvisor and was not expecting too much from this property.Loctation: Conveniently situated, easy access to Covent Garden and Charing Cross.Check-in:Friendly, prompt and efficient, using the dedicated Club Check-in Desk.Room:Club Room - the room was not big, but perfectly adequate. It appeared to have been recently refurbished and was very clean. Rather than having curtains, the windows have sliding wooden shutters, these not only block out light at night, but also cut-down any outside noise (see images). A keyboard is provided in the room for internet access via the television, but this and guest services features were not functioning. The flat sceen tv also had a habit of turning off and displaying the wrong time - a minor issue.Bathroom:Again, appeared to have been refurbished; it was clean and of an adequate size. Complimentary toiletries of a reasonable standard provided.Breakfast: Buffet style, continental and full English - reasonable quality and selection.Public areas: Clean and presentable.Customer Service:Very good, staff had good grasp of English and were quite helpful. My review is based upon booking a 3 day package via the hotel's website, had I paid full rack rate, I think I would have been able to achieve a better deal at another hotel.Overall, I would not hesitate to stay again.	
-	Jul 3 2008	Public spaces good; private spaces very tired	I booked the room on the internet. The public spaces are reasonably adequate. The room was tiny, old fashioned, not air conditioned, not sound proofed, damp stain on ceiling, shampoo dispenser in tiny bath room was empty, television not working properly. When I spoke to the duty manager on check out she seemed to be implying that it was my fault for booking a basic not a 'club' room. I will not be staying here again.	
+	Feb 29 2008 	Stylotel is the best	It's a clean room. Very modern, a little warm but they gave us a fan for nighttime which was great. If you're expecting spacious in London at all, don't go to London. It's a perfect bed and breakfast, you're there to sleep, wash and eat...not sit in the room.Breakfast was very good and always was something to eat. It was kept very clean we were there for a week. I couldn't ask for better. It's location is perfect for walking to many attractions.	
+	Jun 6 2005	Fantastic Hotel	We have just returned from the Howard and had the most amazing stay. We had room #515 which is a river facing room. The room was more than comfortable for the two nighs we were in London, what really made it special was the view. I cannot think that you can possibly get a better view in London, to the right you can see Tower Bridge and to the left Big Ben and the Eye, it was jaw dropping both at night and during day. The extras are expensive there is no doubt, but it's a 5* hotel so you expect that, I recommend the Embankment Cafe for breakfast under £5 and a great view of the river.	
-	Nov 2 2009 	Terrible!!!	Someone called the room telephone at 03.51am and two minutes later, someone attempted to enter the room. I went down to confront the front of house and work out what happened, but the Filipino staff were extremely unhelpful. Ricky, the Filipino night supervisor then accused me of staying in a vacant room - he questioned why I had a card to the room. He then shouted at my friend to say 'I wasn't speaking to you', and then threatened me with saying 'I'll charge you for the room if you go back to it!'Utterly disappointed and frustrated that the night time staff are completely diabolical. Day staff were professional, but breakfast staff have difficultly with customer service (again most were Filipino) After my AWFUL incident at 4am in the morning, I moved straight away to a much better hotel by Hyde Park where the service was good, and rooms much better. DO NOT USE TAVISTOCK HOTEL ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A LONE FEMALE TRAVELER!	
+	Jul 22 2009 	Small and old but a great location	We stayed at the Tavistock for three nights and had a good experience overall. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They answered all of our questions and helped us on several occasions. The room was very small and rather old and worn but comfortable and suited our needs well for the price. Be sure to book directly with them to take advantage of a free three course meal on the first night of your stay. We did however, have to ask to get the coupon for that meal. It was close enough to Russell Square that we were able to walk from the tube to our room with our luggage quite easily. The neighborhood is nice and seems v ery safe. The breakfast was okay, but not fantastic. But the buffet was free and the room it was in was very nice. Overall a great deal for the money.	
+	Jul 12 2006	It's OK for the price.	My wife stayed at the Tavistock while in London for work. I stayed there twice and three days once. It's good and reliable for the price. The room is smallish, but then what is big in London? The furniture has seen better times. The hotle has no Air Conditioning and in a hot night you must have your windows open, even then, the inside temperatrure was 27 deg!Yes, there a lot of sirens and alarms going all night long. Cleanliness is so so. Near my room I saw a tray with half a sandwich for the entire 24 hrs I was there. You could see the sandwich wilting under the heat. Something so simple to correct gives the customer a very bad impression.The front desk was correct but unhelpful I found. Not a smile to be seen. I talked to them a number of times. No smiles at all. Oh well, what can you expect at the centre of London for 61 pounds, breakfast included?By the way, the breakfast was quite good: eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, fruit, juice, buns and not bad coffe. Service at the restaurant was much better than at the reception desk.The coffee being not bad: I was coming back from Eastern Europe where the coffee is terrible, whithout exception. I have only tried worst coffee in Chile.One more thing: The hotel is close to the Russell tube (underground, subway) station and quite close to the great British Museum. A big bonus to me.	
+	Dec 16 2004	Reasonable budget hotel	The Tavistock is a reasonable lodging solutionin in London for savers. I found this hotel by the BA holidays website, for 88$ per night for 2 adults, which is inexpensive (the rack rate is about double than that!). It's a very basic hotel - clean, friendly stuf, but no more than that. There is no shmpoo at the bathroom (but there was a bath tab).The continental breakfast was poor ( tea or cofee, roll, toast, butter and jam. For additional 4 pounds ($7) you can have eggs (any atyle), ham, sauseges, cerial and conserved fruits. No fresh fruits or vegetables.	
-	May 27 2004	Could be better	Stayed here in May 2004 and found the room to be clean and comfortable. The hosts are nice and the location is very convenient - close to the underground station and sightseeing bus stops. Yes, the bathroom was small, but I was more bothered by what seemed to be almost no water pressure in the shower. I am not sure if there are non-smoking rooms at this hotel but if you are bothered by the smell of smoke I would recommend asking. I did not ask so I am not taking points off for that. My real problem with this place was the breakfast. They stop serving breakfast at 9:00 so the small breakfast room was often very crowded after 8:30 and my last day here I ended up standing in line for a place to sit. When I did get a place, I was given toast that had been offered to someone else ten minutes earlier and was cold. The eggs had been getting more overcooked every day and that last day they were practically hard-boiled. I will probably stay someplace else next time, but if I did stay here again I would get breakfast elsewhere.	
-	Nov 5 2009 	Like the Curate's Egg ..........	I will preface with saying I wasn't paying for this trip but I did select the hotel on the basis of the cunningly lit website pictures featuring the new Lodge. It was only one night and, sensibly, I called the hotel before and ensured I had a ground floor double room. A colleague and I had a simple sandwich lunch before a conference and that was fine. There were several parties of silver surfers lunching in the restaurant and this was a Monday. Coffee was good and service attentive. I loved the panelled public rooms and the furnishings, the nooks and crannies and the real fire. The bedroom was small and in need of a lot of attention. Other colleagues had quite a time with the showers which varied from scalding and fierce to dribbly and cold, mine came apart in my hand, but once I got the hang of it temperature and pressure were good. The restaurant where 8 of us dined was a revelation. The chef provided an excellent 2 or 3 course set menu with a more ambitious 'Tasting Menu'. He/she was the doyenne of the Amuse-Bouche we were tempted with little pastries and relishes and salmon mousse between courses plus a fruity dessert all included in the £25 or £29 per head. The colleague funding the wine discovered a particular bottle that he had had in South Africa so was happy. The late night atmosphere was relaxed, the trudge to the room not so good, but all in all, for North London, but a stone's throw from our business destination, at the price, I'd go back. I will recommend, but with caveats on expectations.	
-	Nov 16 2004	A 3 STAR HOTELS AT 5 STAR PRICES	Having read so many positive reviews I was looking forward to my stay, albeit a short one. Having stayed at other Hotels in the immediate area I was aware of what a great location Beaufort Gardens offered. But what a letdown, from the moment the porter and myself tried to fit into a miniscule lift and then had to travel through a rabbit warren of narrow hallways and multiple doors before finally arriving at the room. This was not a room decorated in the manner of those represented on the website and definitely not worthy of a 5 star rating. However, the bathroom was large and light and bright. I pre-ordered a taxi for the following morning to Paddington Station but found a limousine had been ordered instead for a 5 minute journey. I HAVE STAYED AT MANY 5 STAR HOTELS IN LONDON AND THE BEAUFORT CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED AND PROMOTED IN THIS CATEGORY.	
+	Jul 24 2009 	Top of the Line Hotel	Service was great. Rooms were outstanding for London. Delicious food in 3 restaurants. Adjacent to Hyde Park.	
-	Sep 24 2008 	Trash hotel...	Having spent some time to find a nice hotel in central London near Hyde Park - the Berkeley was a BIG mistake. I would have expected better for over GBP 300 a night !The room itself was old and run down with a thread bare sofa and old bed. The food was unbelievably poor for the price - for a chicken curry priced at over GBP 25, I would expect the best, not a tasteless microwave meal.DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL - IT IS TRASH !!!	
+	Jul 15 2009 	Keep returning to this lovely and central hotel	I love this hotel and have stayed here three times. It's a perfect base for a weekend in London. It's recently been refurbished and the newly redecorated rooms are very modern, clean and comfortable. The rooms are small but great. The old character of the building also adds some charm to the lobby area.The location is excellent- just off New Oxford Street, beside the tube, close to Soho and West End yet in a quiet street so you are not disturbed by noise.It's great value for what you get and for the location and there are often good offers available.I have not eaten here but have used the bar which is fine.Keep returning to this central, comfortable hotel	
-	Feb 22 2009 	Not Bad But There Are Better London Hotels Out There	I was in London on a business trip to a student film festival with my mum, and had booked a twin room on The Caesar's Derby Hotel website. I had received a booking confirmation, which I had printed, and even a 'reminder' email a few days before my check-in, confirming my reservations again. However, upon arriving at the hotel, I was told that they had no record of my booking and asked which website it had been booked through. After informing them that I'd booked through The Caesar website, I was told we'd have to wait for someone from the reservations department to come down and speak to me, despite reassurance that there were available rooms and I would still be catered for. This all appeared confusing and unnecessary, but after 25 minutes of sitting in reception, the girl at the reception desk received a phone call, rechecked the system and found that my reservations had magically appeared. With the matter resolved, we were able to leave our bags and check in later the evening. The twin room was quite small, but big enough for a short stay for two. The bathroom was an adequate size, with a bath/shower. It was very clean, tea and coffee facilities and bathroom products provided. Despite being in a predominately residential area, there was music played at night, so I would suggest requesting a room on the second floor or higher. We stayed on the second floor, and while it was audible, it was in no way invasive or loud. Upon check-out, we were again able to leave our bags and collect them later that day. Overall, it was a fine stay, despite some initial difficulties. However, while The Caesar was a perfectly decent hotel, there are better stays for similar prices elsewhere in London. Ultimately, I would recommend it, but only after some serious hotel-hunting first. If you do book, take a copy of your reservations!	
+	Nov 25 2007 	Excellent location great hotel	Exellent location for anyone wanting to explore London, just down the road from Lancaster Gate tube.Arrived early and one of our two rooms was ready, absolutely lovely room very modern decor.Breakfast was included but we all paid extra for a buffet breakfast which was very nice.Would recomend as a base to visit all the London sights and the added bonus of the lovely rooms.Our bags were stored for us when we checked out so we could spend that day without having to carry our luggage around	
-	Aug 26 2006 	very small rooms	very small rooms, we travelled with baby and had cot ready but didnt have space for anything. no air conditing, very narrow and it was a deluxe room!! very simple breakfast, would rate it a low 3 star	
-	Sep 27 2007	Dont Stay Here	WARNING do NOT stay at this hotel-they are liable to cancel your booking without notifying you. Thats what what happened to me after a 24 hour flight.	
+	Oct 17 2007 	What a great location for a hotel	What a great location for a hotel, close to shops, theatres ect. and for the tubes and buses We upgraded to a superior double room, well worth the extra £15.00 per night, Ideal as I stayed here with my husband for our anniversary. When we booked we made sure that a full english breakfast was included with our bookiing. The service at breakfast was good and we had no trouble getting a table at any time.There is a Tesco express nearby, so you do not need to spend too much money on things like bottled water, etc. Which is always expensive in hotels.	
-	Jul 21 2006 	Rip-off merchants	The hotel is fun and stylish, but they take price gouging of their guests to new levels. For 7 local calls and exactly 120 mins of internet use I was charged more than USD 150!!!!! I had a regular reservation (with a cancellation policy of 2pm) and I informed the hotel at 6am that I would check out a few days early and they then came back to me saying that I had to pay for the entire stay - an additional 4 nights. We did fix this in the end, but I had to escalate this all the way to the director of revenue at the hotel and I wasted about 2 hours of my time doing this. Apart from that the hotel is fine - no onsite gym (you have to go to LA fitness down the road).	
+	Apr 9 2009 	Nice shopping weekend	Hotels in London are small and so are the rooms at Chesterfield. But they have managed to get the most out of the space available.Even before arriving we had a great service in that the Hotel send us a great guide on how to arrive at the best Hotel from Heathrow.Room was ready at arrivial as was a nice bottle of champagne included in the weekend package.Breakfast next day proved to be a bit of surprise in every positive way. A la carte eggs - never tried that before. Buffet had everything I would exaect and some.After a nice shopping trip we came back and got the tickets we ordered at the reception for a musical in one of Londons theatres. We also enjoyed the afternoon tea also included in stay.All in all a very pleasant stay and I would certainly recommend anyone to make a stay at Chesterfield and check out the weekend deals at the red carnation hotels.	
+	Mar 30 2009 	The staff couldn't have been better in any way...	Stayed here last weekend in twin room (304) with friend. At first disappointed with room, as nothing like those pictured on website: Meticulously decorated and extremely well-equipped, but small, and quite dreary colour-scheme. All very mann-ish - would suit a couple of blokes better (we were hoping for one of the completely over-done flowery numbers!). Hardly any space at end of beds, and bathroom really tiny. Having said all of that, there was LOADS of wardrobe and drawer space, LOADS of top quality toiletries, amazingly fluffy towels, tea and coffee tray with proper cafetiere and real coffee, free internet on TV in room (and also downstairs in the computer centre), real hairdryer (ladies, you know what I mean!), the most comfortable duvets, pillows etc., and even a stationery tray in the drawer! Staff were exceptionally friendly, welcoming and helpful - seemed to anticiapte every request and deal with them professionally and happily. We LOVED this place. Gorgeous little pub across the road (&quot;The one and only footman&quot;), 10 mins walk from Green Park tube and buses, one of the most beautiful and safest parts of London. There was even a friendly bloke in the building opposite who waved at us every time we looked out our window! I can't wait to come back to The Chesterfield!	
+	Jan 26 2009 	Romantic and beautiful	I booked this hotel for my girlfriend with a view to having a romantic weekend, it was the perfect choice and perfect weekend.The room was superb and everything said by the hotel in it's profile is spot on. In the upper market of location and hotels in London, the staff do not rest on their laurels and reputation, customer service is of the highest order.The only downer, was the price of drinks in the bar. £15 for a Vodka and Orange ? Then again my girlfriend was half hammered after one so it was a relatively cheap night !I brought my girlfriend a necklace from a jewellery display cabinet at the hotel, it means so much to her, a lovely reminder of the time we spent at the Chesterfield Mayfair.	
+	Aug 10 2007 	Unique experience	In July this year I stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine. We were looking for a good hotel and got the name of the Chesterfield from a travel agent brochure. We checked out the hotel's reputation on tripadvisor before booking. I must say the hotel has a lot to offer: next to its excellent and quiet location, the staff is extremely friendly and very service-oriented; rooms, restaurant and lobby are very well maintained and very clean. Breakfast is superb. We didn't have lunch or dinner at the hotel though.A bit on the downside was the size of the room we stayed in as well as its wallpaper: the deep blue vertical lines all over the room felt very unrelaxing to say the least. Still, this is a detail and probably related to personal taste.As the price / quality mix is quite right, and the hotel is very well located, I'd definitely advise it to other travellers, especially to Business travellers.	
+	Mar 20 2007 	Not the Ritz but hard to beat for just a few quid!	The Hotel Columbus is located in a vibrant area of Paddington/Bayswater, off of Sussex Gardens (a very active hotel street) very close to Paddington station and the Lancaster Gate tube stop. The front desk staff is very welcoming and friendly, and the continental breakfast that is included in the price was superb. We had to book an additional night on short notice because our flight was cancelled, but they worked with us and gave us a good price, but make sure they give you whatever is quoted on the website; there's no reason to pay rack rate. FYI, they do provide wi-fi connection (when it works), but like more and more places, they charge for this convenience, and it was 2 GBP/hour. The rooms were small and cozy, but comfortable. The bathroom was functional, albeit cramped. The stairs were also snug, particularly for big football player-sized guys like me, especially for the third (fourth to us yanks) floor, but one finds this all over Europe, really. All in all, you'll be hard pressed to find a better place to drop your bags and crash, and enjoy a quick shower and breakfast in the morning, than the Columbus. It may not be luxury, but chances are if you're reading this, you're not looking for 5 stars and 300 GBP to pay a night for a bed, either.	
+	Jun 23 2008 	Great Hotle for Business and Leisure	It is always difficult to find a good hotel in London under £200 and after staying in London monthly for work the Cumberland is one of my favourites. Price is around £170 per room which by London prices is good. The lobby is spacious and gives a great impression. The hotel has over 1000 rooms across 2 buildings, try and request to stay in the main part as the building as the rooms are bigger and its not as far with your luggage. Rooms are a good size and have comfortable interiors. There is a choice of over 3 bars and different restaurants which are all open late. Location is Pratically next door to tube station so great for sightseeing. I would recommend this hotel defintely for business travellers due to its facilities and to tourists who want easy access to the city and a grand hotel.	
+	Feb 8 2008 	Not bad!	Was there for 1 night for business purposes. Lobby looks great but rooms a bit too small. Room designed nicely, complete with ironing etc, as well as flat screen tv. Bathroom is OK, with a spacious shower, but whoever designed the shower needs to know that people hate walking into the shower, switch on the shower and get drenched with freezing water sicne there is no way to avoid it ;) :)Overall a god hotel for london, much better than a few I stayed in my frequent travels to London !	
+	Aug 29 2009 	Convenient to everything	Having checked the comments on Trip Advisor my wife &amp; I decided to stay at the Darlington. It was a very good choice. After reading of the squeaky floor problem I asked for a room on the top floor and was allocated room 404. The room was clean, as was the en-suite area.We over looked the main road which allowed plenty of fresh air and the small table fan along with the open window worked well to keep the temperature just right for a good nights sleep. There was ample storage space - we were travelling with two large suitcases to cover three climates.A lift to all floors, small library of paperbacked books, TV in the room (good reception), security is very tight - electronic key to the front door, another locked door to gain access to the inner area of the hotel and of course another lock for your room.We found the staff to be friendly and polite. The breakfast was very good - as mentioned by others the hot food is cooked to order and the portions were generous.We have already sent copies of the hotel brochure to our UK friends who visit London frequently.The location is very good - five minute walk to the underground, many passing taxi cabs, plenty of restaurants &amp; pubs in the area. Close to a large shopping strip which includes a Marks &amp; Spencer. It was an eight minute walk, towing our suitcases, to Paddington railway station to catch the Heathrow Express. We would be happy to return to the Darlington Hotel next time we are in London.	
+	Feb 5 2007 	Excellent Hotel	We booked a triple room and got 3 single beds which is exactly what we wanted. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was clean and fresh with a good sized bath. The breakfast was excellent. Full continental and bacon and egg (singular) cooked to order. The location was also excellent being only one block from the Underground and a variety of restaurants. A hint for using the internet....there is an internet cafe close by which is much cheaper than connecting to the internet via the hotel. The hotel staff were excellent, the receptionist even went out in the cold and rain to get us a cab after the one she had called failed to show up.	
+	Jul 12 2009 	First class	I stayed at the Dorchester for one night only for the purpose of a special occasion. This is a world class hotel located in an exclusive part of central London. The small amount of reserved parking spaces in front of the hotel are only ever full with Ferraris, Aston Martins, and Bentleys etc.On arrival, the lady at reception was 100% welcoming, polite and professional.Room was luxurious, spacious and perfect.On a separate occasion in 2007 I had dinner at the Dorchester and again the service and quality was 100% at all times.This hotel will not come cheap, but for a special occasion/treat, you should certainly not be disappointed.	
+	Jul 18 2007 	The best place	Plush and super fancy. The rooms are sumptious. You'll never want to leave. Service goes above and beyond. Tea here is awesome. Very English. Overall, it's very expensive, but money well spent.	
+	Apr 18 2007 	A class act of perfection	We stayed at the Dorchester for four nights over Easter having not stayed there for several years. The experience was wonderful with smooth and sniling service in plush surroundings.Our room was a deluxe room which overlooked Mayfair which is not the best view - the Hyde Park rooms would have a more picturesque view. However the room was large with lovely traditional, quality furnishings and a great bathroom - natural light, one of the biggest baths in London and a shower that could accomodate four should you so wish! Toiletries were all Floris with luxury robes and a surfeit of towels.The in room entertainment facility was good with internet and films reasonably priced. There were two soft chairs and a chaise longue and working desk.The public areas of the hotel can only be described as stunning, especially the Promenade where breakfast, teas etc are served. The Grill Room is done in grand Scottish decor and is really impressive.Throughout our stay theservice from all staff was exemplary and there was always staff on hand.The hotel is in a great situation with Hyde Park across the road, Mayfair on your doorstep and Knightsbidge ten minutes walk away. There is always plenty of taxis if one of the Ferraris, Lamborghinis or Rolls parked outside does not belong to you.Our Easter rate was a good deal for the class of hotel and included a bottle of Champagne and breakfast each day ( which if we were paying would seriously mount up).Great experience.	
+	Jul 8 2009 	The Gainsborough hotel london	I long weekend away with my friends.Very very pleased with hotel, small but very clean.hotel staff very helpful.reception staff very helpful they provided transport maps and advised on transport linkshotel 5 minutes from the tube station (green, yellow or blue line).There is no restaurant but the continental buffet breakfast is very yummy with a wide selection of food.I will definitely go back.	
+	May 5 2006	A delightful small hotel	The Gallery Hotel in London is charming. Rooms are small, but tastefully decorated. The staff is young, yet very friendly. Andrea Valera was most helpful at all times. The hotel is situated two blocks from the S. Kensington Tube. The neighborhood is nice: many good restauranst, especially Pauls across from the tube for morning croissants &amp; tea. I will definitely return.Diane K. BaderHollywood, FL	
+	Aug 25 2009 	Superb business and leisure location	I now make a point of staying in The Gore on all of my visits to London and have unhesitatingly recommended it to all of my business contacts all of whom have been equally delighted by the quality of service, location and superb facilities. Centrally located with discrete and welcoming reception areas The Gore is an ideal location for business meetings and receptions.	
+	Aug 3 2009 	Very good location a good base for a weekend in London	For me, this was almost a perfect stay (minus the billing). The hotel is well located close to Trafalgar Square at a reasonable price. It's also close to the pier for the O2 express (I was in London for a concert in O2 and found that the express boat was the best way to get there).The single room was a bit small, but modern and very clean - and for a laptop user, very well equipped (complementary wi-fi/wired internet, monitor cable for the flat screen tv, sound cable for a laptop or mp3-player etc). Safe big enough for a mini laptop, coffee/tea maker in the room, iron/board, extra coffee/tea and chilled water to the rooms available in corridors. The room was air conditioned. The only downside was that the window was facing an opposite wall that was quite close, so there was absolutely no view, but that was quite alright for me, there was enough room to get daylight in anyway.Leaving the hotel, I was in a hurry to the airport, and did not notice, that they charged the VAT over the VAT inclusive price, so I ended up paying the VAT twice. I emailed them a couple of days later, and they corrected the mistake and refunded my credit card, so in the end, everything was ok.Definitely would stay here again.	
Jan 17 2008 	Just too expensive for the quality	The hotel is well located next to Victoria Train/Tube and Coach Station. The hotel entrance and lobby look top notch but that's where it ends.I had a double room for single occupancy and it really was small. The room was just ok but very tired and cramped. My nan has a tele newer than this room! The bathroom was small and dated but the mould over the shower seemed to like it!Breakfast was ok and a small queue was handled efficiently and courteously. Didnt eat dinner in the hotel as the location gives you plenty of other options.London hotels are notoriously expensive but this really is too much too pay for such a poor room - most of the budget chains have better rooms at much lower rates.	
Aug 27 2008 	Hampered at the Hempel	We stayed here for the holiday weekend August 08. What should have been a relaxing weekend turned out to be a bit of a trauma.Firstly, the hotel cancelled our booking when we added an extra night. This was fixed and our first impressions of the hotel was very positive - lots of neat, quirky but minimalist features with a great entrance, bar and good rooms.Upon closer inspection however, the rooms - 11 years old, now need tlc and in some instances seem dated, albeit clean - so they should be at over £200 per night. Also, the tv was not working and required a maintennance visit.The service is not reflective of the prices and as there were 2 weddings during our stay, the hotel seemed more keen to prioritise this than anything else. We had a letter in our room on Saturday virtually banning us from reception for half an hour on Sunday morning with guests being ushered out of the hotel via the basement service entrance. Seriously - we were not allowed in the lobby!At breakfast, It took 25 mins for toast, 35 mins for fresh bread, 20 mins for cold meat, cheese and butter to be replenished on the buffet due to staff working on the wedding. Also only one fruit juice out of 4 available. No offer of a cooked breakfast on either day. Not the kind of service one expects when shelling out £13.50 for a cocktail in the (very nice) bar!!!! If that weren't bad enough, our bill had been overcharged,(for cooked breakfasts not even offered) our friends too, by £50+, in addition to 4 other couples departing at the same time as us.All in all, not value for money and more style than substance. My feeling is that the hotel is sufferring success syndrome and resting on its laurels. Lastly, the overcharging seems to be contagious................ I hope it's just a &quot;bad weekend&quot;...................	
Oct 8 2009 	Great Hotel Great Breakfast	Stayed for one saturday night in the Kensington Hotel. Rooms more really nice and what surprised me the most were tailored for women. Decoration was excellent, hair dryer was big enough, womens magazines etc etc. This meant that my spouse really enjoyed her stay and had nothing to complain about which made my stay even better!Breakfast the next morning was excellent with fresh fruit, breads, cheeses and a hot menu also. The location is perfect if you want to explore the South Kensington and Knightsbridge region. You can walk to Hyde park Knightsbridge in about ten to fifteen minutes. Well deffinitely stay again.	
Sep 10 2009 	Excellent hotel superb bed great breakfast	Booked very much at the last minute, but managed to secure a superior king size room for £190 plus VAT including breakfast for 2 people. Room was on the 4th floor and with windows onto a quiet side street. The room was certainly large by London standards, spotlessly clean and well equipped. There is a mini bar which you can't use as a personal fridge which was a very minor irritation. There should have been bathrobes - and these were missing, but we couldn't be bothered to phone reception and ask for some. The bathroom was large with underfloor heating and nice toiletries. There was a large plasma screen tv in the bedroom and supposedly free wifi, although we didn't manage to get our i-touch to find the network, despite phoning reception for help. I suspect our room might have been too far away from the router. The bed was really comfy with a feather duvet and feather pilows. An excellent night's sleep was ensured! We walked to the Albert Hall for a Prom concert in the evening and came back to the hotel for dinner. The restaurant food was excellent, but the wine was a bit pricey. Breakfast was superb. Lots of choice including imaginative healthy options and a good range of cooked choices in addition to the &quot;full english&quot;. Service was polite and friendly.The hotel is in between South Kensington and Gloucester Road tubes, and we think South Ken was marginally closer. In short, a great find and we would certainly stay again.	
May 12 2008 	Great hotel wonderful location ... with a few buts ...	I have booked three nights at the hotel for my weekend in London. I booked before I read the reviews just because the location and rates were wonderful. I arrived at the hotel at noon and check in was fast and simple. My room was number 5 in the lower ground floor and was quite issolated from all the other rooms. There are no elevators in this hotel so I had to drag my suitcase down the stairs but it wasn't that bad. Having booked the hotel prior to reading the reviews I was ready for the fact the loo was outside the room but to my surprise I got a room with both shower and bath and a loo :) The room was big and spacious with a queen size bed, TV, work area, there was a ventilator, ironing board and coffee/tea making facilities. It was a great treat for a solo budget traveler and the location made it even more wonderful ! Althought in general everything was great , there are two spoilers that bothered me a bit . The first one was the strange noise I kept hearing which I figured out to be the noise of the tube on the Piccadily line that apparently passes right under the hotel :) but still it wasn't that bad as I didn't spend the day in the room and I was so tired at night that it didn't really bother my sleep. The one thing that did annoy me more than that was the fact that the hotel doesn't have a luggage room. This was especially annoying since my flight back was at 22:30 and the hotel staff weren't really keen on helping me , they could only appologise and say it was &quot;company policy&quot; so I found myself dragging my bags to Euston station (in case you would like to use this option it costs 6.5 Pounds per bag).In general I really liked my stay, since I'm a budget traveler this room was very good in comparison with other hotels I've stayed in around London even with the two small &quot;surprises&quot; I've mentioned before.	
Jan 20 2005	Paradise Found	I stayed at the Landmark on Sunday and Monday night (the 16th and 17th respectively). The service was of the highest calibre. Having spent 11 hours on a Saturday night en route from Cape Town to London in thecramped economy class of a South African Airways plane, it was sucha relief to arrive at the Landmark at 10 a.m. on the Sunday morning todiscover that my luxurious room had already been serviced and wasawaiting immediate occupation. One power shower later and a two hour sleep and I had successfully banished the aeronautical cobwebs from my mind. I have stayed in about fifty different London hotels over the past twenty years and my room in the Landmark was by far the largest I have ever occupied. Superb. The bed was so comfortableand the curtains so effective in blotting out the light outside that eventhe most hardened insomniac would sleep there.Faced with a choice between paying an airline company an extra £1,000 - £1,500 sterling for a business class seat or flying economy class and spending a few days in the Landmark to recover from anoverseas trip, the traveller with time on his/her hands should alwayschoose the latter of these two options.I have only one reservation about the Landmark. The fact that they charge £4.50 for a minuscule bottle of mineral water from their mini-bar. I could understand a 400% mark up and a charge of £2. But £4.50 constitutes evidence of rapaciousness on their part and it is deserving of the strongest criticism. Isn't it time that the hotels started behavingreasonably towards their customers by charging them fair prices for the drinks in a mini-bar? If any reader of this review could alert the tripadvisor website to a hotel in London which charges a reasonable price for the drinks in their mini-bar, I would be interested to hear about it. I suspect that such a hotel probably does not exist. In the meantime,consumers should vote with their feet by buying mineral water for less than £1 sterling in the retail outlet at Baker Street underground station and carrying it back with them to their rooms in the Landmark hotel.Having complained about the price of mineral water, I still rate theLandmark as the best hotel I have ever stayed in in London. There's just something special about the place which is deserving of the highest praise. Paradise Found, as Milton might have said.If walking around the area in the vicinity of the Landmark, make surethat you you do not miss Marylebone High Street. It's a narrow windingstreet which connects Marylebone Road to Oxford Street. And it's fullof the most elegant delicatessens, restaurants and curio shops. Wellworth a leisurely twenty minute stroll (or more, if you want to explorethe shops in greater depth).	
Jul 5 2004	The best 5* so far	Just returned from a three night stay at this hotel and can say say of the five 5* hotels I have stayed in so far in London, this one is by far the best value. The Marylebone tube is in sight of the hotel giving easy access to just about everywhere in the capitol.The junior suite I stayed in was spacious,clean and very quiet and a rate of £255.00 ($ 460) inclusive of all taxes and services charges a bargain at London prices.The only downside that I would say is that it lacks an intimate atmosphere of say the connaught, but you can have a drink at the Connaught without staying there. Overall superb.	
Jan 5 2007 	Wonderful experience in a great location	Having stayed at the Langham for the first time over the New Year holiday for 3 days I can honestly say that it was my most pleasant hotel experience to date. From the moment we arrived the exceptionally friendly staff could not do enough to help us, I honestly don't think that they know how to use the word &quot;no&quot;, and with the most absolutely perfect location for shopping, 20 seconds from Regent street, 2 mins for oxford street / circus. We stayed in the Langham Club area of the hotel, and booked the &quot;romance&quot; package which included champagne, chocolates fruit and fresh flowers in your room on arrival and also a complementary &quot;Romance&quot; dinner in the Memoirs restaurant, which in itself is an experience not soon forgotten, we counted 20 staff that took care of us with various aspects of the meal, such great service and amazing food in a beautiful setting. Go on spoil yourself!!	
Nov 25 2004	Worst Hotel in the World?	I cannot stress quite how awful this place is. If you look you will see that there are many bad reviews about this place. I urge you to read all of these before you make a decision to book a room at the Lonsdale. Colleagues of mine stayed here and listed a catalogue of reasons not to stay: fleas in the beds, decrepid furniture, porta-loo-toilets!, ridiculously poor breakfast, strange smells in the rooms, etc. Furthermore, they were concerned about the other &quot;guests&quot;, who appeared to be treating the place as a doss-house. All in all, this did not add up to a pleasant experience and they only managed a couple of hours sleep. NOT what you want for accommodation.	
Feb 27 2004	5 star dump	Well i wish i had read these reviews before i booked. When i entered the hotel it looked very run down and basic but it wasnt until i had payed in full for my stay and had been showed to my room that the shock had hit home. The room was a dirty ******** it can't have been cleaned for years, It was total mish mash of old tacky furniture that had been painted and was falling apart, I can't belive how this hotel meets heath and saftey regulations!! with its smell,dodgy lighting and the poor washroom faciltys.DON'T STAY AT THE LONSDALE HOEL	
Feb 24 2009 	Excellent alternative for a hotel room!	Our group was of four adults and three children. We stayed in a 3 bedr + 3 bathr apartment in the Mansions for four days, in February. It was a huge flat to accomodate 7 persons, comfortably. The dining room and the living room being separate gave the grown ups a chance to sit around the dining table and chat in the evenings while the children watched TV in the living room. The location is perfect, being on the main sreet, close to the tube and with many markets and places to eat, nearby. We really enjoyed our stay there and would highly recommend it especially to the ones traveling as a group.	
Apr 2 2007 	Good value and great location	5 minutes's walk from Earls Court tube station, in a road with some attractive gardens opposite. The welcome here is always pleasant.Rooms at the front are a bit noisy, especially in summer because there is overseas student accommodation opposite. The building next door is being renovated (Jan 07), and work starts at 8am so don't book here for a lie-in this Spring! The rear rooms are very quiet. Most of the doubles are quite spacious, the singles just adequate. Showers, no baths. Cleanliness is OK. Their housekeeping is a bit haphazard - not killer problems, but stirring your tea with your biro is a bit annoying, and jamming curtain rails rather more so.Lots of stairs, so it might not suit the less mobile, but plenty on offer on lower floors.Definitely a cut above most small lower-cost hotels in this sort of area, and with direct tube connections into the city centre.	
Apr 24 2008	Great hotel great location	Booked the hotel through lastminute.com and had some reservations after reading the reviews on the website concerning the size of the rooms, check in/out and breakfast. Contacted the hotel before arriving advising we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The manager kindly upgraded us to a studio suite which was very clean and spacious. The whole stay was very pleasurable from check in to check out with no queues at any stage in the process and the staff being very helpful. The location of the hotel was excellent and I would throughly recommend this hotel.	
Jun 22 2009 	Consistently Tops	I have been working in London on and off every two weeks for about a year now. Most of my stays are with the Mayfair hotel. It really is 5 star without being so uptight. Te food is great and the atmosphere always seems to have something going on with big stars and paparazzi often in the lobby. You can even walk to Buckingham Palace The only problem i've had was having to ask for an extra sheet (they only have one on the bed), which was delivered promptly. A great hotel and a consistent experience.	
Apr 23 2009 	Would come back here if in London	I quite enjoyed my stay at the May Fair. The hotel was a short walk from the Green Park tube station, which is a straight shot on the Picadilly Line from Heathrow. From here, we were able to enjoy some of the sights of London, including the nearby Buckingham Palace and a bit further walk to the Parliamant Buildings and Westminster Abbey.The lobby is modern, my room updated with very nice furnishings and a very good looking black-tiled bathroom. My rate included free internet, but somehow my colleague paid $20 more and didn't get internet, not sure what that was about.Concierge was very helpful picking a restaurant, and helping us figure out the best way to head to our next meeting out of the city in Beaconsfield.My only complaint is that I had a room facing a small inside court, which was essentially a view of the HVAC system. You might want to ask for an externally facing room.	
Jan 12 2007 	Mixed Emotions About May Fair	London is ridiculously expensive, but our research suggested the May Fair may be a reasonable option for our stay in London. The location is quite good, the recent renovation sounded appealing and the price for what is suppose to be a 4 star hotel lured us in. Note to self; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Using London as our hub while travelling throughout Europe, we spent a total of about a week at the May Fair. Upon our arrival for the first night, the doorman immediately opened the taxi door, greeted us with a smile and took our luggage from the car into the reception area. I was impressed. The lobby was attractive and the person assisting us at the front desk was quite helpful and agreed to show us several rooms. We settled on an attractive room that had a large bath, with separate walk-in shower, clad in black granite, a television built into the bathroom wall and complimentary wifi. I was pleased with our choice and thought the hotel would be a fine place to call home. We checked out early the next morning to continue on to our next destination, but booked a room for our return visit with the same gentleman who assisted the previous day. Because of our multiple night stay, he told us he would reserve an upgraded room for our return visit. Excellent, so I thought. Upon our return, there was no one at the front door to assist us with our bags and the gentleman at the reception desk was less than charming. We explained to him that we were given an upgrade, but he resisted and told us there was no such claim indicated in the computer. He gave us every reason as to why he couldn't give us an upgrade, so I asked to speak with the manager. He informed me that he was the manager. We went back and forth, and he became slightly confrontational with my wife, so I basically told him I would be happy to go elsewhere for the duration of our stay in London if he wasn't going to honour the upgrade. He opted to give us an upgraded room, but I didn't appreciate the aggravation. Furthermore, we later found that the television in the room didn't work, the wifi didn't work and there was a food odor coming from the bathroom vent. We checked out the next morning to continue on to our next destination, but not before speaking with the morning manager about our problems. We were assured that we would be given a comfortable room for our return visit. Fair enough. We returned about a week later and were shown to our room. It was clearly an upgraded room, with a huge bathroom with dressing area, and they left us a bottle of wine. A very nice gesture. Moreover, no more than five minutes after arriving in our room, the phone rang; they wanted to make sure we were satisfied with the room. A nice touch. Everything appeared to be hunky-dorey. However, the next morning, at about 6:00, we were awakened by the fire alarm blaring in our room. We called downstairs and were told they would check on the situation and call us back. The alarm finally stopped blaring and they called back telling us there was a malfunction with the alarm system. What a way to start the day! I marched off to the shower to get a fresh start, but I found myself standing in about three inches of water; the shower drain was clogged and the water was not draining. I wasn't too happy. I finished cleaning up in the tub, which was no easy task as I had to climb up and around slippery surfaces due to the water from the shower overflowing onto the black granite bathroom floor. We alerted the hotel about the drain and were told it would be taken care of. Fine, things happen, so I carried on with my day. That evening, I confirmed that the shower drain had been taken care of and I was told that it had been. No worries. The next morning, at about 6:00, the fire alarm in the room awakens us again. This is getting to be irritating. A call downstairs indicates there is nothing to worry about, it's simply a malfunction. Great, I love being awakened by the sound of an excruciatingly loud fire alarm two days in a row. I march off to the shower, turn on the water and find myself standing in a pool of water again. The drain apparently was never fixed. We got dressed and went to speak with the manager. He was very cordial and offered various forms of compensation for our troubles, but this experience definitely put a bad taste in my mouth. Also, the wifi in the room didn't work and housekeeping left behind dirty drinking glasses and neglected to replenish the tissue. We were happy to leave the hotel, just as I suspect the hotel was happy to get rid of us. If they could straighten out these types of issues before they become problems, it wouldn't be a bad place to stay, but short of that, I would have reservations about staying there again.	
Oct 8 2009 	ottimo rapporto qualità e prezzo		
Jan 18 2009 	Great location	We had a great stay at The Metropolitan. Service was terrific. Staff very helpful and hotel was centrally located. We could walk everywhere.Room overlooked an office building but it was well-appointed and larger than most London hotels.Would be happy to return!	
Oct 3 2009 	Excellent	We stated two nights and were totally pampered, We fed well and the menu was everything we had asked for, and more. Nothing was too much for the staff and they provided the little touches that made the stay something special. We got married there and everything was perfect down to the smallest detail.The staff provided a service that was something to remember [ they are not paying me to say all this] .I would recommend a stay here if you want to that special hotel above the ordinary and we left feeling we must stay there again. Many thanks to the Milestone team for a wonderful stay.	
Apr 9 2008	A perfect hotel	From arrival at the door, the experience was impeccable. Staff was courteous and extremely efficient. Decor, elegant. Food splendid. Room, a bit small, but superbly appointed and excellently served. The location in the quiet Montague Street adds to the stays restful quality. All in all, it is our first choice in London and has been for some years.	
Aug 23 2009 	nice hotel in a nice neighborhood	we stayed for 3 nights and everything went right. nice and clean room. and small bathroom but also clean. we only had a little tiny problem with the window: it couldn't close well... we used some newspaper and tape and we splet good as well. quiet place.	
May 11 2009 	hotel "essenziale"		
Nov 29 2008 	Estupendo para una escapada		
Feb 26 2007 	small small room	My family traveled to London last summer and stayed in Oxford hotel for one night. We selected this hotel because I saw the good comments in this site. Our room was on 4th floor and there was no lift. I need to carry our heavy lurgages climbed up to our room. The room was very small and the tiny toilet which can't take the shower freely. However, the room was clean but there full with peigen (--) outside window.	
Feb 14 2007 	brilliant value for money loved it!	I have just come back from London with my 12 year old son, I was nervous booking something in our budget that might be grotty and unwelcoming. Our room was very clean and well furnished we had a microwave and fridge and kettle, all tucked away in a cupboard so the room looked just like a bedroom in any hotel. We had our own key to come and go, and after days full of walking we were in our rooms warm and cosy with facilities so that we did not need to venture out again at night.Staff were helpful, breakfast was as much as you need and locaton fantastic.Pub on corner, restuarants on your doorstep and five minutes to tube. We will come again and I would recommend it to my friends.	
Jun 20 2007 	Awful Experience	Upon arrival, I was placed in a smoke-filled non-smoking room. The room had been cleaned, so the hotel had to be aware and placed me in the room anyway. I guess hoping that I would not need to inhale while there.I requested a move and landed in the room with the creature. Yes, a portable air conditioner with a huge tube tail that had to be placed out the window during operation. The first night, I awoke in a sweat, and found the creature's tail was dismembered, leaving the creature in a puddle of it's own excretions.Next, I attempted to approach the shower in the hole, where the bathtub extended behind the lavoratory wall.The floor and walls were sadly dirty and stained.To top it all off, when leaving the hotel one day early, I was told I had to pay a full extra night's fee because I left early. Imagine that.Sheraton should strip their name from this sad little nightmare on Picadilly Lane.Please see photo of the creature below.	
Aug 24 2003	Different Hotel?		
Sep 15 2009 	Clásico bien situado		
Mar 29 2009 	excellent welcoming spotlessly clean hotel	Lovely boutique style hotel in South Kensington area- handy for Natural History and the Science Museums. 10 minutes walk from Gloucester Road Tube station on the Picadilly Line and close to Earls Court. Checked into hotel 3hrs early (so we could leave our bags in order to investigate London) and were immediately allowed into our rooms by the welcoming reception staff. Beautifully furnished with the comfiest beds and spotlessly clean. Full English Breakfast was beautifully cooked and presented. Restaurant Staff were all very pleasant but our only criticism was the slow service - we waited 5 minutes to be seated at a table, there were no spoons on the table and there were slight mistakes with the order. But overall this hotel was lovely and we would not hesitate to revisit or recommend.	
Jan 17 2008 	Fabulous Hotel	Parkcity is a boutique hotel. Rooms are quite small but adequate. The bedroom was spotless and the moltel brown products went down a treat!! Would stay here again.	
Oct 27 2009 	Good boutique hotel great location	We stayed here for a couple of nights in September with friends and really enjoyed it. The Pelham is a traditional boutique hotel (inside and out). We stayed in a deluxe double, which was a good size at the back of the hotel. The decor was lovely (quite traditional, but not old fashioned), our bathroom was large and very nicely appointed (two sinks, marble floor, shower over the bath etc). All the usual nice hotel things. We loved the honesty bar / lounge - such a great room, filled with interesting antiques - you almost feel like it's your own living room, which I guess is the idea (spent a bit much in there though!!,maybe should have been less honest!). We ate breakfast in the restaurant one day, which was fine (nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about). The staff are friendly and helpful (esp. the kiwi concierge), price good for London, location good (next to South Kensington tube, 15 mins walk from Kings Road, 2 mins walk from Natural History Museum etc). Plenty of restaurants and bars near by - try the Admiral Codrington (pub) and the Enterprise (used to be a pub, now a gorgeous little restaurant).Very good, we'd go back.....	
Nov 2 2006 	Good and Bad	This is the third hotel I have stayed at in London in the past few months. This was the least favorite.Good points: We were able to get an early check-in and the front desk attendant was friendly. The Concierge was very helpful. The room was immaculate, probably the cleanest hotel room I have been in for years. The location is good.Negatives: We asked three days in a row for our refrigerator to be fixed with no luck. The hotel is so hot we had to have the a/c on constantly. It was incredibly noisy and very ineffectual. The breakfast was awful. The first day the eggs were so hard that they could not be pierced with a fork. All remaining days, the eggs were raw on top. The sausage had some sort of mystery substance in it, the fruit was nasty etc. etc. In five days we were offered coffee only once. We had a room with a 'garden view'. Anyone who has been in one of these rooms can attest that the 'garden' is like something out of a Monty Python skit. We howled.	
Aug 7 2006	safe and comfortable	Have stayed there twice and my college age sons also twice by themselves. Safe for solo women travelers; staff very helpful; rooms comfortable but if you want a city view, request it. Food and bar good.Excellent location; easy to get to from Heathrow; a bit of a trek to Covent Garden but tube is easily accessible.	
Jun 27 2006	Another Rembrandt fan	Came as a freebie with a British Air flight special so we were a little suspicious. To our surprise, the hotel was charming. our room was a good size, with a nice sitting area. we enjoyed the lounge and bar and breakfast was impressive. best of all, the location was spectacular. we were stopping in London for only two days, to visit friends, and continuing on to France and we spent one of our precious days simply crossing the street and enjoying the fabulous V &amp; A museum. While you can't beat &quot;free&quot; we'd actually pay to stay here.	
Mar 22 2005	Liked our stay	We have stayed in the Rembrandt for the first time. All the others times we were in London we always had to complain about the hotels. This time we did not have to. The hotel has a great location, a very friendly staff, a good breakfast and a normal price. This hotel excells also in cleanlyness, both for the room and for the restaurant and lounges. For us a good reason to come back when we visit Londen again. Nevertheless we advise the management of the hotel to refurbish some of the rooms. Not a problem yet, but within a couple of years this might be nessesary.	
Sep 29 2003	Staff is wonderful	The Rembrandt staff was friendly and helpful and the room was very nice and had a warm ambience to it. We had an executive king room with AC and I would recommend the rooms with AC. Heard several complain about the heat and stuffy feeling in the rooms with no AC. The upper portion of our room windows opened for fresh air. The included breakfast was generous but somewhat plain. Housekeeping was excellent. Ice had to be ordered from room service, somewhat inconvenient. Overall, a wonderful hotel and I would stay again.	
Aug 30 2008 	Birthday tea at the Ritz real treat	Five females from 22 to 60 in various garb arrived for tea. Lovely reception warm and friendly. Excellent cocktails - don't look at the price it's scary! Loved the tea -birthday cake was a lovely surprise and was delicious. Ritz roses were beautiful. Palm Court was delightfully OTT. I felt the staff were genuinely nice - it didn't seem to matter who you were.It's a special treat and we enjoyed it. Thank you to all the staff	
Oct 17 2005	Scruffy hole	My daughter and I have just come back from London after booking this hotel with 'Lastminute'. What a disappointment; their webiste gave it 8 out of 10, a joke surely. The hotel is scruffy, dirty and smelly. The room we were allocated (deluxe) was tiny, dark, and dinghy. Behind the net curtains the windows were rotten, flaking paint and a not too nice smell. We were patiently told at reception that they had 3 room types and for an extra £20 we could be upgraded to an executive room - hurray!! So on to room 623 it was. The only thing I could see any different to the Deluxe room (apart from the extra £20 coming out of my bank account) was a 'free' small bottle of water. Although all the staff were pleasant enough and the location great, I wouldn't waste my money here again.	
Dec 10 2003	A disappointing room		
Dec 17 2007 	I practically live there	In the past 6 months, I have stayed at the Soho an average of 15 days per month, so I'm virtually a resident of the hotel. Because I am away from home so much, consistency of cleanliness and service are very important to me.The Soho is in impeccable shape; the physical plant is well-maintained. As wonderful as the facilities are however it's the staff that really makes the hotel stand out. From top to bottom, the Soho staff is gracious, attentive, expedient and down-to-earth.My only reluctance to wholeheartedly recommend this hotel is my worry of over competition for a room.	
Sep 18 2008 	Very nice option	Finding a hotel that is reasonably priced in London is incredibly difficult. There seem to be either very expensive or inexpensive yet sketchy hotels. The Sumner is moderately priced by very expensive London standards and is nicely located near the Marble Arch tube station. The hotel is located on a quiet street full of hotels that don't look nearly as nice as The Sumner. The hotel itself is well-appointed with comfortable rooms, a friendly staff and complementary breakfast. The room was spotless, quite large, and relatively quiet. The pros of the hotel are: it feels like (and is) a higher end boutique hotel, great location, reasonable room rate, staff, clean and modern rooms. I would definitely stay at The Sumner on a return visit.	
Apr 17 2008 	Sooo quiet!	Picked this after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. It was a good choice...5 mins from tube station. Whole hotel was very clean and well decorated. Staff very friendly and helpful....our shower sprang a leak and they were very quick to get it sorted. Beds were really comfortable and it must have been the quietest London hotel I've ever stayed in...slept very well! Only criticism was that breakfast was not very varied.....after 3 days it was getting a little repetitive. Oh......and tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been a nice touch. But we would definitely stay there again.	
Oct 30 2007	Fantastic Sumner	In my opinion the Sumner Hotel and all of the staff are quite simply outstanding!! The public spaces are warm and inviting and the staff could not have been more gracious.My only concern is if one has mobility issues they only have a few rooms that dont involve some steps. We were in room 208 and the lift took us up to the 4th floor. We then climbed 5 steps. However, I was assured that when booking that the rooms in the lower level and on the ground level do not require steps. In any event help was offered if needed. With the sky high prices in London this hotel offers real value and the breakfast buffet was nicely presented. This will be my hotel of choice in London as long as the current management and staff are in place. Also the room was very quiet and everything was very clean throughout the property.Rick C,Washington Indiana	
Nov 7 2006	Polish hotel	Very good service quality and very nice and helpfull stuff - all of them are young polish people.	
Oct 20 2009 	Beautiful view but definitely needs repair.	Beautifully located near Tower Bridge with views on river or St. Catherine docks. Some repair should be done soon. Bathroom not so clean as it could be. Water-tap moving in every direction. Windows very old and I had feeling that after opening they will go down.	
Mar 30 2008	Guoman Tower London great location.	Booked our hotel through a travel agent. Excellent location, right by the Tower of London and London Bridge. Took a launch from Tower Pier to the O2. Room fine, beds OK, a little narrow. Breakfast fine. Concierege service excellent. Would definately recommend and use again.	
Aug 14 2008 	Disappointed HH Diamond member	On holiday with my family we stayed 3 nights at the Trafalgar Hilton. The Hotel would be better served if it changed its name to a &quot;W&quot; hotel. It is a minimalist boutique hotel with sparse if any decor in the rooms with little semblance to a Hilton hotel; cold and sterile is the best description. I had reserved 2 rooms, the twin beds in one room would be better described as cots as they were extremely small. As a HHonors Diamond member I should have been given complimentary room upgrades with free continental breakfast. The later was not offered and I had to negotiate the breakfast option at the forfeit of the room upgrade. The hotel finally obliged to offer us both amenities of room upgrades and breakfast. In all my years as a Diamond member this situation was ridiculous. Another gimmick I found interesting was that the hotel added gratuity to the beverage and restaurant bills after the fact without informing you of such action. Not sure of the appropriate tipping standard in the UK, I added a tip to my bills. Upon check out I realized servers received a double tip. Candidly, the hotel is ideally situated but that is about it. As a point of reference our next stop was the Arc de Triomphe Paris Hilton..that was an outstanding hotel and the manager of the Trafalgar Hilton should pay them a visit.	
Dec 18 2007 	Great Views	Stayed at the Trafalgar in November for 2 nights as a treat for my partner as it was his birthday. We arrived too early to check in but were told that our room would be made available within 1 hour (which to our surprise it was). We stayed in a deluxe room which was nice with great views of Trafalgar Square, the hotel is a great location and all the great landmarks of London are within easy reach.The lobby came alive in the evening with a funky DJ. We had dinner reservations elsewhere but breakfast was a delight and the live music was the finishing tough to a fantastic trip to London.Overall great hotel with courteous staff.	
Mar 1 2009 	Filthy!	This hotel is undoubtedly the most unclean place I have ever stayed in.The room was tiny, there were stains on the wall, black dust everywhere, horrible mould on the showerhead and the floor of the 'en suite bathroom' which was a converted cupboard as far as I could tell. The walls of the toilet did not even reach the ceiling so it was not very private!I honestly hardly wanted to get into the bed the room was so filthy. When I complained about the filth a colleague was promptly sent up with a wet towel! He stood in the room and asked where I wanted cleaned! It was obvious! The place was disgusting and the reception staff were uninterested since they already had their money and their no refund policy. We ended up buying cleaning stuff and doing it ourselves.The 'free' parking cost 20 quid and I was asked to move the car around regularly. They also asked for my car keys so they could move the car around whenever they needed too. To be honest I wouldn't have trusted these cowboys as far as I could throw them.Avoid!!!	
Jun 8 2005	Very pleasant inn in a great location	My stay at the Vicarage Hotel was great. The location of the inn is fabulous - located in the shopping district near Kensington as well as Notting Hill. About a 5 minute walk from 2 Tube stops. Rooms and bathrooms were clean, the price was great, and the breakfast every morning was ample and good. Staff was courteous and helpful - went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate me when I had to stay a few extra days due a stolen passport. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice B&amp;B experience in the London area.	
Nov 4 2009 	Excellent	Excellent service.Excellent guest Relation Manager(Kerstin)excellent Rooms for the Complete Travel Group.	
Jul 18 2009 	Covered up dingy hotel with modern trappings	We booked this hotel to be near to St Pancras as we were departing on Eurostar next day. For this reason only, it was a good choice. We got a package with breakfast included but still expensive. The breakfast was not good anyway, the service was mediocre and the food was under par. This is an old hotel taken over by the Hilton chain. It could be beautiful but it is not. It is dingy. The carpets on each floor are showing black around the sides dues to dirt/mould. Unacceptable for a 5 star (it is not 5 star). The lobby is not attractive at all. Hilton needs to invest massively to bring this hotel up to a good standard, it is shameful. The rooms are acceptable in terms of good beds, but the windows are old and dingy, the bathrooms are not good and the atmosphere is ridiculous - an old 'dame' of a hotel with bedrooms that look cheap and do not at all fit with the decor of the hotel. Everything about his hotel is mediocre and disappointing. There are many other hotels in central London at this price offering much more. Hilton management - you need to get this hotel refurbished.	
Jul 5 2007	Upscale and cozy!	After reading many reviews here I thought that I should definitely give my opinion of the Waldorf! I traveled with my husband and two teens last month. We stayed for 3 nights and I booked two rooms. I transferred American Airlines points to my husband's silver Hilton Honors account. Considering that the rooms were going to be $600 each per night, I thought that trading the points was a good value. London is outrageously expensive with our terrible exchange rate! The hotel is located right next to the Aldwych theater where we saw Dirty Dancing ( Fantastic show)! It is a small boutique feeling hotel which seems to be newly refurnished. The decor is modern and fun! The rooms are quite large and the beds comfortable, although a bit soft. The negatives were that the rooms on the street side were noisy. The first night we stayed on the interior side but wanted to switch to a King bed the next night. The first night was super quiet and the next two nights were not. The mornings were noisy with noise from the street starting quite early. There was some confusion with breakfast for us. When I asked the night manager for a complimentary continental breakfast with our Hilton Honors, he offered it to us. We had it one morning. There was a cold buffet that was average with fruit, pastries, cereal, etc. and then you could order something hot from the menu. It wasn't bad but outrageous at L22 ($40 each). They brought us a bill to sign and we were told that it was not complimentary. After inquiring at the front desk we were told that the night manager was new and he made a mistake. They removed the charges, thank goodness! We are not big breakfast eaters so we made do with a little cafe down the street. This hotel is not very close to a tube station. It is in between 2 stations, both are about a 10 minute walk. Not such a big deal unless it is raining. We did like the location because it was not in such a busy area like the nearby covent gardens. Concierges and doormen were helpful and friendly! Hope this helps!	
Apr 27 2007 	Cant wait to go back.	went to watch dirty dancing at the theatre, was very pleased to find the theatre was next door, Booked in to the hotel, Staff treat you like a film star, very professional and friendly, The hotel and rooms were beautiful, we had a inclusive meal in the restaurant which was amaizing. Overall a brilliant hotel, worth the extra few quid to stay in the centre of the city, The first hotel ive been to where i have never had the slightest complaint or upset. Would highly reccomend. Mike.	
Feb 27 2006	Great (if you can get an upgrade)	Booked at Hotwire rate ($135 due to Valentines night) but still the best rate for the location on that night! Managed to get an upgrade to a Deluxe room due to Hilton Honors membership. The room had been upgraded &amp; was on 7th floor [better than floor 1 originally offered!].Room had a good view over the Southbank. Bathroom was very large. Hotel well located for an evening out in central london.Breakfast very expensive [GBP 50+ for 2!] but it was Valentines.However, wouldn't risk it without an upgrade.	
Aug 11 2005	Loved the Waldorf Hilton	The minute my family and I stepped infront of the Waldorf, we were impressed. We were greeted by the doorman, who was very frendly and he grabbed all ten of our bags and delivered them to our rooms. The rooms are a little small but each room has a plasma T.V. in it. We had a Queen sized bed, which seemed big enough to have been a king. THe bathrooms are nto as bad as everyone has said. The door to the bathroom is not see through, but the shower door is. We had breakfast everyday at the hotel, it is a little pricey, but the hot food is very good and our waiter was excellent. The only things that we had a problem with were the elevators, they are very slow and very unpredictable. They are in the process of installing new ones. One other thing is that there is not a pool at the hotel. The pool is located in the L.A. Fitness center that is in the hotel. It is not a family swimming pool, it is an exercise pool. Above all that we had a wonderful stay at this hotel and would recomend it to everyone we know.	
Feb 23 2004	A beautiful hotel destroyed		
Nov 14 2009 	Needs Work	I'm not someone that requires luxury, but I was disappointed by most aspects of The Zetter. The TV was small and wall/ceiling mounted, so it was hard to see, the furniture was base plywood, the chair was dated-modern with a few screws missing, and the shower lacked pressure. The back courtyard was noisy, and the windows were not new, so both the noise and cold air crept through. The staff was polite, but not warm. The neighborhood is OK, but not great, and the location is not the best for taxis (though the desk will call for you). People have told me that he restaurant is above average hotel fare. Bottom Line: Not a bad hotel, but could use some work.	
Feb 16 2009 	An excellent laid back boutique hotel	The Zetter is an excellent hotel with a superb restaurant.My wife and I stayed in a deluxe corner room with a king size bed and it was a good size with quirky Zetter decoration that made it stand out from the run of the mill rooms available in London. Our room was quiet despite it being on the 1st floor and the shuttered windows and balcony, that you can actually open, made it light and airy.The bathroom was great, if a little small and had a wonderful shower .The hotel bar is nice and relaxing and a great place to enjoy a cocktail.The restaurant is superb and offers really high quality italian food as a reasonable.Finally, the staff in the hotel and restaurant are really friendly and made our stay very pleasant	
Jun 9 2008 	what a toilet	I have now done something that I have NEVER, NEVER done before. I have checked into a hotel, gone to my room, and proceeded to check out immediately.I have spent 15 years travelling and staying at some god awful hotels, and this can only be described as one step above a public latrine.Water stains on the roof of both bedroom and bathroom, but black marks on the grout did little to reassure me of the cleanliness.Oh, well, I suppose there is always a first for everything, but in all honesty, how can they try to charge £115 per night for this standard of accomodation.How Thistle hotels can have their name associated with such an establishment is completely beyond me.	
Feb 11 2008	Location great price great....	My friend and I loved this hotel. The location is fantastic, 1-2 blooks to everything. The hotel is nice, clean, big dinning room for breakfast that was included in the price. The room was fine, clean, small but ok bathroom. The price was great too.	
Nov 12 2009 	Dont beleive everything you read!	After reading some of the reviews i was hesitant about being booked in here, however the check in was pleasant, the room i was in which was in the main building was surprisingly spacious especially for London and unlike other reviewers i found my way there very easily!I ate in the restaurant that evening and breakfast the next day, and have had no reason to question the service or the food. Overall considering the city your in i think the hotel represents good value, my experience was of a clean well appointed and presented hotel with polite and courteous staff.	
May 21 2009 	Reminds me why I don't stay at Thistle Hotels	I was booked here by a government agency organizing a committee meeting. I have long given up on Thistle Hotels when I am booking for myself. This rather reminded me of the reasons why. Actually, it was better kept than some and had really nice front desk staff. However, I did not appreciate being given a room on a non-smoking floor that smelt of stale cigarette smoke - it obviously hadn't been properly aired and freshened since the perpetrator left. The room was otherwise clean, although the bathroom toiletries hadn't been replaced - which was a nuisance because I was travelling light without my own shampoo, shower gel, etc. and the towels were threadbare. The room was also rather over-heated with no control other than opening the window and letting in external noise. I also broke Rule No.1 of staying in any hotel, which is never to rely upon them for a wake-up call. Mine never came but a colleague got his ten minutes early! I knew I should have packed my own alarm. As usual in the UK, the internet was a tip off at £15 GBP for 24 hours on top of the room charge. Breakfast could best be described as mediocre and chaotic and the porter disappeared at exactly the point where five of us needed a taxi. Fortunately, I have seen how it's done. .. This wasn't a truly bad hotel, but it won't bring me back to the Thistle chain any time soon.	
Apr 26 2009 	Decent hotel far better than some of the reviews would suggest	We stayed here for two nights as part of a Theatre Break and, having read some of the reviews on this very site, I have to say I have my reservations about the place. As such I emailed the hotel a week before the stay and told the staff that I'd read some bad reviews (and that I hoped my experience would not reflect such reviews). I was offered a room upgrade for £20 for the two nights (£10 per night) which I took.The hotel itself is indeed an ugly building, looking dirty and tired from the outside. The main entrance is a little hidden away, and every time we walked in or out of the hotel we had to fight our way past a group of smokers.The main foyer and reception areas are modern and clean, and the staff very helpful (we found this to be the case throughout the stay).Our room was large and well-appointed. It had obviously had a recent refurbishment, and had good air conditioning and a decent 32&quot; LCD television with alarm clock function. The view from the window was nothing special (more later) and the windows could have done with a clean, but they weren't too bad. Our bathroom was small and perhaps a little dated (it reminded me of a Turkish hotel bathroom) but was clean, functional and, again, well appointed.We had breakfast in the hotel both days and this was nice enough, although the bacon could have done with being a little more fresh. I enjoyed being offered a selection of morning papers to read whilst having breakfast - something I hadn't experienced in an English hotel before.Negatives? Well, the hotel is a little off the beaten track. It's about twenty minutes walk from the closest tube station, which we didn't mind. The area around the hotel is not the best, and could be a little intimidating in hours of darkness. A younger couple (we're in our twenties) will probably cope fine with the location, but I'd perhaps advise older guests to use taxis to get to and from the hotel.The very first time we left the hotel (for a wander) we were follwed around by a gang of young men in baseball hats - it was probably very innocent and all that, but we did feel a little uncomfortable. And as we were settling into our room I looked out of the window to grab my bearings, and witnessed a stop-and-search arrest taking place on the street below...again, not a hugely comforting sight. But not the end of the world either (it's a city after all).Another little gripe - on arriving at the hotel, we were asked to sign a form that set out how much we had agreed to pay. Most of the stay had been prepaid, but the upgrade portion needed signing for...and the form informed quoted a higher price than we had been offered. The receptionist refused to believe the price we had been offered for upgrade, until I produced a printout of the emails I had exchanged with the hotel. It's quite bad that I needed to prove the offer, and anyone who hadn't printed out such details might have been 'ripped off'. This is the only truly negative thing I can say about the experience though, and the staff were 100% helpful during the rest of the stay.The hotel seemed to be frequented mostly by business people and particularly a number of people involved in the medical profession, students included. This meant the reception and communal areas were quiet and there were no rowdy tourists.Overall I found our stay to be comfortable and pleasant, and I would have no quarms in using it again. I am rating the hotel with four-out-of-five, but for the price it's probably even better than that.	
Nov 19 2005 	Very Poor Hotel	The main problem with this hotel is not the property itself, but rather the operations and staff. The worst things that happened to me were:- When I tried to call the front desk, conceirge and room service the phone would just ring and ring (this frustratingly happened throughout the whole week that I stayed.) - My wake-up call was 45 minutes late two of the mornings. - The staff are surprisingly rude, espcially the concerige who seemed irritated that they had to assist you! - It is in a very remote location which made eating and transportation very tedious. - Some days you have hot water, other days there was none.- You can hear everything your neighbour is doing...Overall, it is just a really poorly run hotel which will likely make your stay unpleasant. I would recommend not staying at this hotel, no matter how low their prices go.	
Jun 18 2005 	Not good value	Stayed here on business for 2 nights. Problem on check in as the receptionist, whose English was not good, neglected to tell me that my room was in the annex across the road, so I spent around 10 minutes trying to find a non existent room.The annex was not very well appointed, I had problems with the key card not working, and it was fairly small even by London standards. Toiletries were nothing to write home about - Dove shower gel in a dispenser on the wall (who would want to take away that?).Dining was OK, but parts of the breakfast were cold because of the way you have to queue up for eggs and watch as they are prepared - whilst everything on your plate is getting cold.Lots of the housekeeping staff could not speak English at all, which made for interesting results. Area is very down at heel and you would not want to wander around at night.	
May 11 2009 	Tourist group hotel	The great part about this hotel is the location. It's central and is located at convenient distance from attractions in London. The rooms are modest and clean, unfortunately the only problem is the noise caused by the dozens of tourist groups. SO if you can ignore the morning rush at breakfast time, it is actually quite a pleasant stay.	
Apr 27 2009 	There is NOTHING WRONG with this Hotel !!	Having read all of the poor reviews for this Hotel I was more than a little uneasy when I arrived to check in for one night on Thursday 23 April 2009. However I cannot see how some of these reviewers have reached their verdict - were they in a different hotel to me ? The room which I was given was a single so it was smallish but perfectly adequate and clean. Bathroom fine plenty of hot water and towels and toiletries. As my room had a connecting door to the next one I could hear their TV but it was not intrusive at all. I did not have to queue for breakfast at all and the food was plentyful and fine but when I came out at 8-30 there were about 5 people waiting to be seated. I have got to say that this is not the best hotel I have stayed in but it was a long way from the worst. Nothing at all wrong with it.	
Apr 29 2005	Definitely stay here again.	Would definitely stay here again. The hotel was situated just a 15 minute walk from Kings Cross Railway Station, we managed the walk quite easily with our suitecases. Adjacent to the hotel is an entrance to Euston Railway station and adjoining underground, it couln't be handier. The hotel itself is at the end of a very quiet street, though only minutes from bars and restaurants. It has recently undergone refurbishment in a contemporary style. The rooms are modern, comfortable, and have all the amenities expected such as cable tv, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, bathroom toiletries, a trouser press and internet access. Breakfast was very good, food top class, and plenty of it, only drawback was the queue into the restaurant, everyone seemed to want to eat at the same time, but worth it when you did manage to get a table, which is alocated to you when you reach the front of the queue. We had a glass of wine on the first night in the hotel bar, very expensive six pounds a glass, though they were large, so we didn't bother drinking there after that. The reception staff were extremely pleasant and helpful when we arrived, and they offered us the use of luggage storage on the day we checked out. Though we used the underground station during the evening, it is a lovely walk from the hotel into central London passing several small parks on the way.	
Feb 19 2009 	Just keeps getting worse!	I have stayed at the Thistle Marble Arch 5 times now (It's so close to where I have meetings I'm not allowed to stay anywhere else) and each time it seems to get a little worse. I haven't written a review until now as I generally don't spend much time in my room and since my company pay for my stay I didn't want to moan for moaning sake.The location of this hotel is excellent being just behind Oxford Street, close to Hyde park &amp; most things in central London are easy to get to using the tube with Marble Arch station 2 mins away. That's the only positive thing I can think of. This hotel is billed as 'luxury 4 star' which it perhaps was 20 years ago but in no way matches that description now. The decor is tired &amp; in rooms starting to get shabby. The average cost for room only is over £100 per night which is way over priced for the service &amp; amenities available.When I checked in for a 2 night stay I was offered a superior room with two single beds. I declined due to having had this room option before and both single beds on that occasion had extremely well oiled castors/wheels and everytime I made the slightest movement suring the night, my bed went skidding off towards the wall!! I asked for a double bed and was given a room which I can only describe as a badly decorated cupboard. The room stank of damp, was freezing even with the heat turned on full, the cold water in the bathroom sink wasn't cold, the hot water wasn't hot. The shower had one temperature - scalding - or off. The bed had a mattress which was 4 inches thick, placed on a block of wood perched on an old metal bed frame. There was no iron and only one wall socket worked. The room key cards are highly temperamental and won't work if you keep anywhere near a mobile phone or magnetic clasp on a bag. 3 times I visited reception to get my card reset. Not good if you are on a high floor with a room which seems 4 thousand miles from the lift!!To add to all of this, the WIFI is not free in room or the lobby, the price of drinks from the bar and coffee bar are astronomical (£2.80 for a small bottle of still water!) and even the ATM in reception charges £1.75 to withdraw money. When I've been in London with friends rather than work I would never consider this hotel even with its location as I know you can get cheaper, fewer star'd hotels which offer much better service for half the price.	
Mar 23 2008 	Great location !!!	Birthday weekend with 3 friends (aged 35-45yrs). Great location - close to Oxford Street. Upgraded to executive suite but did wonder what the difference was between the standard room. Breakfast was excellent -variety of choice - self service but quick. Excellent service provided by porters (looking after our many bags of shopping on our return from the shops)!!! Would definitely recommend and hope to stay at again soon.	
Nov 9 2007 	Very good hotel	Very clean, kind staff, good location, comfortable beds.	
Jan 25 2007	Excellent hotel. Great location. Warm 	The hotel was just round the corner from Marble Arch tube station which was great after a long journey down to London. Check in was very quick and the lady who dealt with us was very friendly and welcoming. As we walked to our room the corridor smelt of lavender. There was 4 of us travelling 1 double 1 twin room both were large and over looking Oxford Street (you get a little bit of traffic noise but this didn't disturb us at all), bathrooms were very clean with plenty of towels. We had a very short wait to be seated for breakfast only a couple of minutes and once seated the staff were straight over with tea and coffee. Buffet style breakfast with plenty of choice of hot or cold each table ready set up with butter &amp; jams, milk, sugar. There was also newspaper for you to collect on your way in or out. Every other service that the hotel was excellent from getting you a taxi or looking after your bags.All in all a very pleasant stay.	
Dec 15 2006 	Location Location Location!	Great hotel in a great location, close to the Marble Arch tube station and right around the corner from Oxford St and all the major shops! Clean room,Comfortable Bed ,Great Breakfast, what more could you want.	
Oct 21 2006 	Most Impressed	Having stayed at this hotel some time ago, I wasn't filled with the same feeling of trepidation I normally get when my company book me into a Thistle. This one is a class or two above their over places and it shows.I was booked into a room on the first floor, right on the corner of Bryanston Street and Quebec Street so it was a bit of a hike to go back and forth to reception/bar/entrance but this was the only slight gripe I had.The room was immaculate, roomy and well furnished with a nice clean bathroom which looked fresh. The carpets in the hallway lead me to believe they were only recently laid down.The building itself is a 30's built 'ugly architecture' bulding which occupies a complete block about 2 minutes walk from Oxford Street and Marble Arch tube. You are also next to Hyde Park and Park Lane so it is very conveniently placed for shops, restaurants and other amenities.The bar was packed both nights I was there and was full of Americans and Russians in the main. Although I never ate at the restaurant in the evening (company policy), I took breakfast there both days and found it to be of good standard. Continental breakfast was included in the room rate but for an extra £4 you can upgrade to the 'Full English'.The staff were extremely friendly and efficient and all spoke excellent English and were a pleasant contrast to some of the uninterested staff I have sometimes encountered. Mind you, on their money I would struggle to raise a smile with some of the guests they have to deal with.All in all, I found it to be an excellent hotel with everything you would want, in a very convenient location.One small drawback, reception is on the first floor and there is only one escalator which goes up permanently. You have to take the stairs down although I am sur ethere is a lift somewhere.	
Sep 7 2006 	Not as bad as that	Not at all as bad as some of the reviews make out. Check-in fast and friendly. The corridors were in need of renovation. Room was very small, but clean and furnishings were fine. Bathroom, small but clean, good plumbing, fast hot water, hair dryer. Usual freebies in bathroom.Great location. Only paid £112 for double, breakfast included. A great deal at this price if you want to be in the Oxford, Bond street area.	
Nov 7 2009 	Just what you would expect	I stayed here as part of a party to deliver an event to colleagues. The facilities for the event were quite good and staff were helpful enough but needed to be prompted through our needs. There was the occasional 'jobsworth' moment and when asked for some milk for our coffee whilst setting up we were told to visit a local shop!Fortunately this was isolated and on the whole everything went well.The rooms are large but bathrooms are small and a bit 'tired'. This was slightly out of character for the rest of the hotel and hopefully the management will address this before too long. The hotel was quiet but there was significant noise through the wall of my room from what was a service area(?). This happened at least twice (once at 06:30 am) and I was hardly in the room except to sleep. (Room 125).. Not too good.Breakfast was good with food freshly reasonably freshly prepared with traditional choices.	
Aug 23 2008 	Thistle Westminster	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in August 2008 having booked through &quot;PriceBreaker&quot;. When we arrived the hotel had had a flood and everything was covered over in the foyer - however it was all sorted and open again within a few hours. For an extra £20 per night we took an upgrade to a deluxe room which had 2 queen sized beds and a sitting area. The room was clean and had all the usual facilities. The iron didn't work but this was okay as a second one had been put inside the wardrobe. The bathroom was in need of updating and we had a problem with the bath. This was attended to quickly and efficiently by some very pleasant staff. In fact we found all the staff to be very friendly, polite and efficient. The location of the hotel is great for anyone wanting to visit the sights of central London. Victoria underground one block away, Buckingham Palace at the end of a short street, and Westminster, Traffalgar, the Strand and Knightsbridge are all within walking distance. The hop on hop off &quot;Big Bus Co&quot; tour is directly outside the door. Local eating included very good Sri-Lanka &amp;Indian and an Italian within about 50 yards. I can honestly say that this hotel added to what was a great holiday. I would certainly return and recommend it to whomever reads this.	
Nov 11 2005	Very nice one-night stay	Stayed over last weekend for one night having been at a late function, although we live just outside London it was great not to have to get home. As others mentioned, and as you'd expect in the City, it's *very* quiet at the weekend. For me, that's a plus and we did indeed get upgraded and the hotel seemed almost empty.Would recommend this hotel overall - very nicely furnished and fitted out, lovely big bathroom with LCDTV, very comfortable bed, fresh fruit and such. Really lovely and very helpful and efficient staff.Minus points: as others noted, we experienced long delays for room service food, but the food when it arrived was of a decent standard and the breakfast arrived on time and was very fresh and delicious. Also, the room wasn't huge... we were upgraded to a larger room but I wouldn't want to be in a basic one judging by the size of ours. Finally, parking is difficult. I'm familiar with this area and planned to park in the street a short walk away (normally easy on weekends after 1:30pm sat) but road closures and building work nearby put paid to that and we had to unload on double-yellows outside the hotel and park a couple of blocks away. In the rain. But I guess most people will arrive by cab so wouldn't be a problem.Really nice, comfortable, hotel. Recommend.	
Jul 6 2009 	Good Location	Hotel in a good location - particularly to get to Wembley via tube from Moorgate. Don't bother with Old St station - bit rough and no closer than Moorgate.One of the better Travel lodges - recently refurbished, clean and no frills. As per any travel lodge/premier inn the windows don't fully open so it can get stuffy in a heat wave! And noisy outside - as per any London hotel I have stayed in (lots). Staff on reception pretty miserable but did their job. They were contactable by phone - the number for the hotel in on your booking and they answered each time I called. Maids very friendly and helpful.Didn't try breakfast but it smelt ok. Vending machines in lobby - expensive but good for emergency snacks/drinks. Restaurant doesn't serve lunch and not many places open nearby on a weekend. Master Gunner pub over the road does good food though.Not much else to put - good rates and location. Ear plugs probably required if you get a room near the nightclubs at the back.	
Oct 28 2008 	OK for a cheap London hotel	We stayed at this hotel for one night at the £29 weekend rate. Having stayed at the hotel about 1 year ago, we knew that it was a basic Travelodge. The reason for staying there was the cheap price. However, during this stay there were problems that we didn't have before: some of the staff at reception bordered on being rude, our bed was VERY uncomfortable and general noise from a neighbouring late-night bar was annoying. We stayed on a Sunday, so can imagine the last problem would have been worse on a Friday or Saturday.These issues were just about tolerable for a one-night stay. If you are not put off, the hotel is worth considering as a cheap option for London. Overall opinion - you get what you pay for!	
Jan 24 2008 	brilliant hotel at a great price	I stayed at this hotel for one night on the 22nd jan 2008, with my sister and female cousin. I was nervous about us travelling alone in london, but the area of the hotel was great.We arrived at the hotel at 2.10pm and could not check in untill 3 or pay an extra £10 which we did not feel was worth it. we were told that we could wait in the cafe, which at that time was not open, luckliy we had brought our own lunch and sat at a table to eat while we waited.We were called to check in about half an hour and was in our room just before 3. We had booked a family room, which was a great size. The bathroom was fairly small but had everything we needed.Both the double bad and sofa bed were comfortable and we all had a good night sleep. we were situated in a corner room over looking city road we did not hear any road noise.as i said we were worried about the area, but we returned to the hotel from a concert at around 1am and did not feel unsafe during the short journey from moorgate tube station to the hotel. We did not notice and late night bars or cafes and the only traffic was the occasional taxi passing by. we were already booked up to go back in may and i have no problem in returning.	
Jun 9 2009 	Decisamente un ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo		
Feb 9 2009	Average hotel nothing too fancy	It was OK, nothing too bad to report.Considerably better than Travelodge at Marylebone!Noisy location - on main road - speed camera right outside!No parking unless you can find single yellows after 1800. My car was vandalised outside the hotel! Nothing major, but still annoyed!Groundfloor rooms aren't the best. The area was quite dodgy, so you couldn't leave windows open.Cleanliness OK, room fairly spacious. Would recommend, although location isn't that great, but then it was Battersea, so it's not like a tourist hotspot!	
Nov 10 2009 	Avoid if possible	Arrived at 2pm to be charged an extra GBP10 for ''early check-in''. Room okay and clean, certainly devoid of any toiletries, shampoo etc... The lead in price of GBP19 rocketed to GBP99 as there was a conference on at Excel, which was my only reason to stay there.There are plenty of other hotels in the area so if you get the chance, stay somewhere else.	
	It could do a lot better	Check in slow. Once got to the bedroom realised no toilet paper, had to ask for some - gave me a left over roll from another room. Then realised there was only one set of towels for 2 people! Next day after returning from day out, dirty coffee cups left in room, no restock of coffee, tea and milk - had to go to reception for replacements. Then realised that only one set of towels had been left (we were willing to use the previous days towels but they had removed them). Back to reception for another set of towels ( and had to ask for a toilet roll again!).Breakfast poor/ - croissants not fresh. Yoghurt available one day but not the next..OK it's a budget hotel but GBP 210 for the 2 nights it's not cheap.Their staff were polite and friendly but obviosly a problem with ensuring bedrooms were checked and serviced correctlyThey need to get their act together. To add insult to injury, their online questionnaire asked me one question and then said &quot;Thank you for completing the survey&quot; - Obviously as a company not interested in what their customers think.	
Nov 23 2009 	excellent  clean and friendly good value	Stayed in family room for 4 nights. Staff lovely and very helpful. Room was spotless and linen changed everyday ! Breakfast free for kids and was good value as it was eat all you like.Evening menu in restaurant. Plenty of coffee / milk etc included in room. TV . Excellent location, central London. It was a bit noisy at night , but this was outweighed by everything else. Will be using this hotel for future trips, Excellent place to stay !	
Mar 4 2009 	Basic but comfortable	Hotel was very basic but was comfortable and very cheap and is in a pretty good location. Nothing to write home about but if you're on a budget or not spending too much time in your room this is the hotel for you	
May 4 2007 	Great location	We stayed at this hotel on 2nd and 3rd May 2007 and the party consisted of myself, my mother, my sister and her friend - we were celebrating a birthday and had tickets for Dirty Dancing at the Aldwych Theatre. This hotel is labelled as Covent Garden but it is not located exactly IN Covent Garden. It's just literally a 4 minute walk round the corner in Drury Lane, which runs paralell to Covent Garden. The entrance area in previous reviews has been described as drab, grey and miserable.But I have to point out that this Central London hotel shares it's steps with office buildings for BT (a reputable company) and various advertising agencies. There are about 10 grey-stone steps from the street up to the main entrance but this is in no way depressing or drab - it's just the entrance!The reception staff were mainly foreign, excellent English and polite. We were on floor 4 and our room was clean with two single beds, a brand new bathroom. There was no dirt to be found in the spotless white bathroom or new-slate flooring. The bedroom consisted of two beds, a wardrobe with shelves, a desk with a television and remote, tea and coffee making facilities, a desk with a reading lamp and a large window with a blackout curtain. Our view looked over the entrance and shops on the street below. (See pictures)The good points were it's central location to Covent Garden and Holborn and Covent Garden tube-stations, clean hotel, excellent power-shower, and it's a chain hotel with standards and a secure feel. AND central room controlled air-conditioned for heat or cool air - excellent!The only bad points were that there was no hairdryer in the room (these can be borrowed from reception though for a 2-hour period if you leave a valid credit card as security), and the duvet was a little on the thin side. A great base for exploring London, withing walking distance of the Aldwych and Lyceum Theatres (and most of Theatreland), Covent Garden and Leicester Square. I will definitely visit again should I need to go to London.	
Jun 17 2006	Don't Book at Full Price.	I stayed at the Travelodge Covent Garden for one night in June, having spent the previous few nights in Jury's Gt Russell just around the corner. What a contrast! Given that it would be more expensive to stay in this hotel (at full rate), than what I had paid at Jury's, I would be sorely disappointed if I had paid £89. My £26 room could not be faulted really. On arrival the baking London heat was drying out what looked like a splash of vomit at the entrance steps-not the kind of welcome one would expect but I suppose this WAS sunday morning so Saturday night revelry will always present the odd unexpected obstacle. The proximity of the steps to the roadway could have a bearing on this. At Check-In I was greeted by an extremely bubbly and efficient receptionist who, despite my arrival 2 hours before their agreed check-in time, said that if a room was ready she would be happy to allow me to take it. Luckily there was, and within minutes I was accommodated. The bathroom ceiling looked like it has suffered a fairly serious leak from above, but it luckily held out for the duration of my stay. The linen/toiletries were pretty scarce but the room itself was spotless and spacious with a big comfortable bed. The shower was powerful with lots of hot water. If you want to holiday in Multi-Channel Land this hotel is not for you but I suppose few people take a city break to watch television. The room was quiet and, despite other reviews stating the opposite, I had no problems on this front. Tea/coffee making facilities were present but there is no means by which reception can be contacted other than a trek thru the linen-laden corridors- an unusual situation which I have not encountered in other hotels. This hotel is no palace but if you want a central location at a ridiculously low price (Saver Rooms £26 on selected dates), it is not a bad option. If you are going to pay the full rate of £89 don't bother. Lots of websites will get you classier accommodation in the general area for £75 - £100 per night (Grange, Jury's, and Radisson on some occasions). At the same time, I can see myself returning in the future. A clean, quiet room this close to so many attractions at far below the price of a suburban B &amp; B, is sufficient for many tourists so Travelodge Covent Garden can hardly be faulted on that score. The general areas could do with an upgrade but with the new London High Holborn opening this year I look forward to a newer, fresher, Travelodge option. Incidently, the mess at the steps had been removed before my departure.	
Jan 10 2007 	A few problems but a bargain for all that!	We stayed in the Travelodge Docklands from Dec 27 to Jan 8. I recommend it because it was cheap, basic accommodation (which was all we needed) and because of its accessibility to transit. the positives:We had two rooms, a double for £26 a night and a family room for £56 a night. Can't beat that for London. Both rooms were decent sized rooms (and bigger than rooms in a certain London Hilton according to my husband who has stayed there on business).The hotel was clean, and the bar/restaurant downstairs was convenient. It's standard fare but they serve a fairly good meal if you aren't expecting haute cuisine. The kids liked it as well which was a definite plus.The front desk staff were extremely helpful - we arrived several hours before check-in, exhausted after the usual all-night flight, and were given our rooms immediately on arrival which I really appreciated. Big (2' x 5'!) towels in the bathroom!The hotel is a short, few minutes walk to the Docklands Light Railway which connects to the Underground. It was close and convenient.There is a small but excellent grocery store just on the other side of the DLR, convenient for anyone wanting to pick up late night snacks or (wonderful!) pastries &amp; juice for in-room breakfasts. the negatives:We had a difficult time getting the housekeeping staff to clean the rooms &amp; in particular the bathrooms every day, probably because we tended to leave later on in the morning and they didn't think to go back and do them. I had to go down 4 days in a row to complain that they hadn't been done. Apparently the hotel ran out of toilet paper!! Perhaps that's why the maids hardly ever replaced the empty toilet rolls. One day the maid left us with 1/4 of a small roll to share between 3 people. I had to go down several times to request more toilet paper and met other guests doing the same thing but the front desk staff were always apologetic and gave us as much as we asked for.No phone calls to the rooms from outside the hotel. We desperately needed to contact our son in the room once while we were out and were told that because it was a budget hotel it was not possible to have the call transferred to the room. This meant that one of our party had to go all the way back to the hotel which was a real pain in the butt. Noise from the roadway if you have a room on that side of the hotel might keep some awake though ear plugs did the trick for us.Bottom line: We all agreed that even though there were problems we would be happy to return to this hotel. This hotel is particularly recommended for families or anyone who needs to keep a strict eye on the budget. You'll get a clean, comfortable bed with own bath/shower (depending on if you have a dbl or family room) in a no frills hotel. (I'd rather spend my money on fun stuff!)	
Jul 16 2007	good value travelodge	Another good value travelodge.Everything nice and clean.Helpful staff.We were going to Twickenham, and got a bus outside the travelodge, and walked back - it was a long walk but not a problem.It also has a very nice bar.	
Dec 19 2006 	Great value for central London	Ignore the other two reviews about this being a dangerous place, some people are scared of their own shadow.. My wife and I had a Sat/Sun night there, we staggered back to the hotel sat night after a show, a good meal and gawd knows how much wine without a problem. There is a bar on the lower floor near reception which may account for the other two reviewers accounts, most probably the unsavoury types stood around drinking were guests.This hotel is having a bit of a facelift so the main reception is closed but there are clear signs directing you around through the car park to the rear entrance.... no big deal in my opinion. Check in is quick and simple, the room was clean, plenty of hot water, tea/coffee, tv with optional 'extra' channels for £6(don't bother), big comfy bed and thats it. If you want opulence book elsewhere this is a bargain basement hotel near Kings Cross, not Knightsbridge. We worked out that we spent maybe all of 18hrs actually in the hotel during a 2 night stay, if you're coming to London to see the sights and have fun this is the place to book if you can get a £26pn deal.	
Jul 10 2007	Value Budget Accommodation in London	This is a good budget hotel in a good location in London. Completely no frills, but you get a good bed and a good shower. Room was clean and perfectly acceptable. When you consider the prices of hotels in London you can not do much better than Travelodge. Recommend a Family Room if you want extra space as these rooms are large and have a couch.	
Oct 5 2009 	Shocking customer service - went from being a great stay to a terrible one!	We stayed in Travelodge Marylebone for 4 nights in September. We had booked a few months previous online, booking their saver rate rooms for a great price. It wasn't the easiest booking system to use - you couldn't just punch in your start date to end date for the cheaper rooms - you had to book each night individually and hope you were given the same room for the entire stay. We thought we had booked four nights, but somehow managed to only book three. Problem was that we weren't aware of this and nobody let us know until 4pm on the day we were supposed to leave! Yes, I realise this was our mistake, but when we checked in the receptionist asked how many nights we were staying, we replied 'four' she then went on to say 'so checking out on Tuesday 8th' which was correct so we had no reason to think that we had booked wrong.Each day we had to go back and get our swipe key reprogrammed which was no problem. On the Monday (the day before we were leaving) we got back at 3pm, got our key reprogrammed and went back to our room. We realised we only had one towel, so my friend went back downstairs - she came back a few minutes later saying we weren't booked in for that night and if we didn't pay £100 for that night straight away we would have to leave and pay a late check out fee. I found this very confusing as just an hour before we had been at reception getting our key reprogrammed and nothing was mentioned!We went downstairs and spoke to the girl on reception who was extremely rude to us, so we asked to speak to the manager. The manager has obviously no idea of customer service as he too was extremely rude, raising his voice several times, all in front of other customers. We admitted that obviously we had made a mistake with our booking, but we couldn't understand how it hadn't been picked up until late that afternoon - if we had been told at check in we could have easily arrange alternative accomodation for the last night. At 4pm though, that was a little trickier. He would accept no responsibility despite us being told at check in that we were there for 4 nights. He told us that the receptionist would have had no way of seeing how long we were booked in for (??) and she would have taken our word for it! In the end we had no choice and had to pay for that night's accommodation. He would not budge on the price, charging us the walk in rate, despite us having stayed there for the previous three nights.As with other people who have reviewed this hotel, I found making a complaint extremely difficult, and all I got in return was an email from the manager saying he did not mean to come across an confrontational. No apology and nothing to try and smooth over the situation.This hotel went from being in our minds a great one - because it does have a lot to offer in terms of location, price etc. to a terrible one. I would never stay here again based on the extremely poor customer service.	
Aug 16 2007 	Great if you get one of their Saver Rates. But BEWARE no left luggage	Stayed for three nights and only paid £26 a night so this is an absolute bargain. Hotel is just outside Marylebone station and Baker St tube station(with a lot more lines) is a five minute walk away. I'd never really been in this neck of London and it's a nice mix of business and residential, traffic noise isn't too loud, it's even easliy walkable from Oxford Street. Good bus connections too from just outside the door. The hotel room was fairly standard three star business class hotel. A good size; a few scuff marks on the wallpaper where people had run their suitcases along the walls but otherwise very clean, good beds, extra pillows. The bathroom unfortunately was less impressive. Small, poor flush on the lavatory, shower fittings were quite rusty. But the shower did work well after we tightened the nut around the taps so the bath/shower selector worked correctly. We were in town to see some shows so we only spent time sleeping in the room. If you want a luxurious space to relax in, then look for another hotel. We had no meals at the hotel as there are lots of breakfast options at the station. However there were two major drawbacks with this hotel. One : no air conditioning. Our room faced due south so fortunately the weather was quite cloudy as otherwise it would have been unbearable. The window does open, which might be a problem if you have small children. It meant we could get some fresh air, but had the temperature been really hot outside it would have been almost impossible to sleep. Two : They refuse to hold bags for guests. We arrived on an early morning flight and were lucky that a room was available at 11a.m. But on our last day we had an evening flight and the receptionist said they didn't have any facilities to leave our bags. We had to drag them to the left luggage at Victoria Station. This is the first time I have ever come across this situation in a hotel and was quite angry about it as the website, of course, doesn't mention it. I now realise how lucky we were to have had an early check in. Would I go again. Not for the full room rate, no way. But at the saver rate definitely. And only with light bags!	
Feb 27 2009 	Great location good value for money	I stayed at the hotel for one night and as a whole was very pleased with the hotel. Contrary to what many people have said staff were actually really helpful and polite. The room was pretty basic but very clean and comfortable, for a person like me who was staying there for one night only the basic furniture wasn't a problem at all, though the lack of a proper wardrobe, drawers and night tables could be a problem if staying longer. Bathroom was basic too, but very clean and well maintained. Bed was also pretty comfortable and I was really happy with the flat screen TV and the tea and coffee making facilities. Even though my room was looking towards Fenchurch Street rail station I think it was well insulated and quiet as I didn't hear any noise at all, heating was adequate too. The nearest tube station was only a few minutes walk so the location is definitely a plus. Overall, the room was exactly what I expected, if you read the description before you book you shouldn't expect any surprises, also take a look at the pictures other reviewers supplied - rooms correspond exactly to those pictures (but not to the ones on the Travelodge website). If you manage to book a room well in advance for a decent price the hotel is well worth the money.	
Nov 11 2005 	best London Hotel I have stayed in	I was not looking forward to staying here after some of the other reviews but at £35 a night I thought I could bear it. What a pleasant surprise! Staff very helpful and friendly, excellent breakfast with fruit, yoghurts, cornflakes, meats, cheese, croissants and English option ( £3 more). Room spacious with flat screen TV, desk and clean. Even more amazing was an iron and ironing board in wardrobe - I was there on business and this was great. I checked at reception and they said only some rooms had the ironing board.Internet access downstairs and a bar. Locally there are loads of restaurants from chains like Subway to ethnic. Single woman may feel a bit nervous is some of the surrounding streets which have budget hostels so stick to main road and access hotel from there. There was never a problem but my wife gets nervous as we are not used to the big city.	
May 3 2005	Decent	The Westminster is not a dump, but it is not the Ritz either. Basically, you are getting what you pay for.The rooms are on the small side, but they are comfortable and fairly clean. My only complaint was a weird odor, I wouldn't doubt it if the furnaces were rather moldy. The complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus. Although it was nothing special, (just juice, bread, milk, cereal, coffee, tea, yogurt) it was a nice start to the morning.The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location is great in a quiet area of Notting Hill Gate overlooking a courtyard. Comfortable, nice-looking, does the job.Thanks, Westminster Hotel!	
Dec 12 2007 	A cozy place to stay	I stayed at Vancouver Studios from November 29December 4, and it was a great experience. I was traveling solo, and the setup and location of this hotel couldn't have been more convenient. It was also nicely priced at £79 per night for the large single room (I stayed in room 33). First the location - it's within a five minute or so walk of the Bayswater and Queensway tube stops. Between the two tubes, you can access the Circle, District and Central tube lines. Prince's Square is a relatively quiet street off the busy Queensway, which offers lots of restaurants and shops, including Boots, Tesco, and the Whiteleys shopping mall with a Marks &amp; Spencer. On the minus side, it was also loaded with a ridiculous number of souvenir shops and quite a few low end stores. I wasn't crazy about the Queensway atmosphere, but it offered a lot of conveniences and I felt very safe walking alone at night in the area. The hotel itself feels very homey. The lobby is more like a living room, with a couch, fireplace, and computer for accessing the internet (50p for 20 minutes). There was a Christmas tree set up in the corner of the room, which added even more charm to this already lovely space. There were lots of antiques and interesting items throughtout the hotel, and I especially enjoyed seeing the deer head wearing a hat every time I climbed the stairs to the third floor.I arrived around 9:45 in the morning, and they said that my room would be ready by 11:00. I left my bags in the luggage room and checked by emails before heading out for some coffee. When I returned, my room was ready, and I hefted my bag up to the third floor. The stairs were pretty narrow, and the third floor stairway was mighty steep - I was glad that I only had to haul my bag up once and down once!I had reserved the large single room, and was glad that I had not gone for the smaller room which was available for £69 per night. The room was long and rather narrow, but did not feel too small for just one person. The room was set up into two areas - upon entering, the half-bath was just ahead of the front door. Through a separate door on the right was the bedroom, containing a twin bed, small table and chair, kitchenette, and shower stall. The closet was tiny, but had 7 or 8 hangers. The in-room safe was at the bottom of the closet, and there was a shelf on top. The kitchenette was great - two burners on the stove, kettle, microwave, refrigerator, toaster, dishes, cutlery, glasses, the works! The shower contained a nice shampoo and shower gel, although it was odd to look out at the kitchenette while showering. They did not provide bar soap for the shower, or a facecloth.The room was very clean, and was kept that way throughout my stay - towels were always replaced, my dishes were washed, and the coffee service replenished. The walls were the only thing that looked a little grimy - they could've done with a bit of a wipe-down, as there were some dirty fingerprints and such in several places. The bed was a bit on the soft side for me, but I can sleep on pretty much anything. The duvet was quite comfortable, and I appreciated having the extra pillow.The TV was mounted on the wall, and there was also a DVD player. You can rent DVDs from downstairs for only £1 each, and they have a nice selection to choose from. The first time I tried to use the DVD player, it didn't work. However, it was replaced with a new one the same day that I brought it to reception's attention, so I was able to watch &quot;Notting Hill&quot; before heading there the next morning.The only thing that the room lacked was an iron; however, there was one available in the laundry room downstairs. Knowing that I'd have to walk downstairs and then back up three flights of steps made me lower my standards about acceptable wrinkles, so I used my wrinkle release spray and skipped the laundry room.The front desk staff were all very pleasant and friendly; a couple of them were especially sweet, and made me feel right at home. I requested wake-up calls on three of the mornings, and they were all made promptly. They also answered emails that I had sent before my trip quickly and accurately. I had only a couple of small quibbles about the place, neither of which would stop me from recommending it or staying again, although they could be issues for some people. The luggage room isn't locked, so you leave your things at your own risk. I walked in and rummaged through my bag after it had been stored, and no one seemed to notice. Also, as the stairs are quite steep, it would have been helpful to either have a lift available or have someone nearby to assist with luggage. Anyone with difficulty walking up stairs would do well to request a room on one of the lower floors.I found the hotel to be a very good value, especially as I was able to bring groceries back to my room. The atmosphere was very comfortable, and I'm sure that I will stay here again. I highly recommend it.	
Feb 25 2008	worst hotel in the world	We had booked out accommodation online, via the Vegas hotel website about 4 weeks before our arrival date.just to make sure, although i had written printed confirmation, i had called the hotel to confirm our booking and was told all was fine.we arrived at the hotel at 3am to then be told that our booking was canceled due to our credit card not working (it was working fine after calling the bank). I had then said but we have cash to pay for our stay. They didn't care, they wouldn't give us a room. we had to find a place to stay at 3am in the morning. Shocking service, i would never recommend this place to anyone	
Nov 19 2008 	Poor example.	Been staying in London for many years and this Hotel is symptomatic of the gradual detereoration in the standards that you could expect..even 5 years ago! Overpriced with ignorant staff!! And to cap it all they wanted me to pay for a replacement plastic key that broke..even though it had been probably been used a thousand times..... by the same number of people. When I refused they later took it out of my account anyway!! Illegal and disgraceful!!!!	
Apr 27 2004	Good quality hotel	Stayed in the Washington last Friday night - room quite basic but the bathroom was excellent (Executive room). The location is defintely the best part of staying here - so many quality restuarants just a stones throw away. Service was good although we were chased up to vacate our room at Midday on the dot - I'm sure an extra 20 mins wouldn't have made that much difference! Breakfast was excellent with plenty on offer. I would definitely recommend a stay here.	
Apr 6 2009 	Excellent budget choice clean	It is very clean, very small but did not really bother us since it was in a really good location and neighborhood. 10 min walk to Hyde Park, 3min walk to Underground, 3min walk to 24h Sainsburys (one of the best UK super markets). If you need a place to sleep in a really good location I guess this is it	
Jan 25 2005	Good location cheap but not recommended		
Feb 7 2007	Clean Convenient Budget	My husband and I stayed here for a week between Christmas and NYE. The rooms are small, cramped even and quite well-used. The furnishings, bed and rug look a bit grubby. The rooms can be loud especially if you have one facing the street. The TV is indeed prison-style. That said, it is cheap and very convenient for transport. The neighborhood is not exciting but it does give a great jumping off point and seemed relatively safe. Our room was clean when we arrived and well-cleaned every day. We were provided with fresh bedding and towels daily. The staff was helpful and enthusiastic and the hotel looked nice from the outside. I wouldn't stay here if I had a lot more money but I don't and if you are considering this hotel you probably don't either. This is a fine choice for a budget traveller.	
May 8 2008 	great London value	If you are looking for clean, comfortable , spacious and reasonably priced accommodation in London, The Windmill has got to be on your list. The Windmill is a popular pub on Clapham Common, a wonderful big green space close to Central London. The tube station is 4 minutes walk away, and buses stop close by, or if you have a car, there is a special car park on site. The high street has many good eating places and pubs. Rooms are on 3 floors at the rear of the building, which means noise from the pub is not a problem. Rooms appear newly renovated (we stayed here on 2 occasions in different rooms) and are quite spacious with an armchair and writing desk . Like most hotel rooms in Europe, they are well heated, but if too hot, there is air-conditioning to override it. Breakfast is generous and served in the large conservatory eating area inside the pub. The staff (who seemed to be nearly all Australian) were helpful and if you stay a weekend, you get a special reduced tariff. We loved this hotel!	
Nov 16 2008 	Correspond aux infos annoncées		
May 12 2007 	Posizione perfetta		
Apr 27 2007 	Good Location Lousy Apartment	The location is very good with close proximity to 2 Tube lines. Flat # 6 is very run down with dirty carpets and blown bulbs, broken shower screen etc Don't bother contacting Woogoo's Customer Care Manager. He or she does not respond to comments.	
Aug 14 2004	Excellent is not enough...	Spent one evening here on August 4. What a delightful spot. Our three teenage children took one room, my wife and I had the adjoining room. Arriving late, from Chicago, this was a perfect spot for us. The rooms are suites, and have sitting rooms, with wet bars and tv's and a love seat. The bedrooms were quite comfortable, with tv's, extra comforters for the bed, and plenty of space for luggage. The baths were more than adequate, with two basins and a bathtub in the main room along with a separate shower. The toilet is in a separate room . The breakfast was buffett. You can also order off a menu. We had a nice walk along the Thames before breakfast. Wish we could have stayed longer. An excellent hotel; we'd stay there again in a flash.	
Feb 19 2007	Small with friendly atmosphere	Originally planned to stay at a Hotel in the next street, but they were full and recommended this to us, and phoned ahead to check on room status.Very friendly staff, who offered to show me the room before deciding. Beautiful and clean with a four poster bed. (Lovely wooden floor but just watch as it became very slippery when wet from snow off our shoes.)The waiter at breakfast was very friendly and keen to offer advice, and suggested that to arrive at Quebec City we should take the ferry from Levi's. By the time we were ready to check out he had asked the Receptionist to print out directions and a map to make sure we approched from the road to the south of the river.Would recommend this to someone who wanted to stay in Vieux Montreal in the heart of the shops and restaurants, and just short stroll from the beautiful Basilique Notre-Dame.	
Dec 10 2007 	wonderful	I waited until the last minute to book a trip to Montreal and had few choices as to where to stay. I saw Auberge Vieux du Port and it looked nice so I blindly took a chance. Sometimes dumb luck is the best way to travel.On the way up to Montreal, I took a recent copy of Conde Nast with their annual readers' poll. Turns out Auberge was the number 1 hotel in Montreal and number 7 in all of Canada.I understand why it gets high marks. The staff is outstanding, the hotel is adorable, the location is perfect, and there are so many little things they do well. I was on my own, but was always comfortable and well taken care of. The concierge gave me her card when I checked in -- just in case I had any questions while out and about, and then called my room to make sure that &quot;everything was perfect.&quot;There is a wine and cheese reception in the bar each evening. The bedding rivaled top hotels in Europe. And I could not have been happier in the Old Port section of Montreal. It is magical at night when the lights come on, there are adorable shops, restaurants galore, and art galleries to poke around in.The food scene in Montreal is amazing. I had some of the best meals ever, and felt that had I chosen other restaurants, I still would have. There are so many to choose from.I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a boutique, well serviced, comfortable experience. Oh, and their restaurant was very good too.	
Nov 2 2002	Excellent Inn		
Feb 11 2009	Bad breakfast	Nice hotel and location, but the breakfast...If they call a very small glass of orange juice, a slice of bread and a glass of coffee breakfast...	
Dec 14 2006 	it IS very good!	Yes, our room was small and had a tiny bath. But that is as hard as our criticism will get. The Chateau Argoat is in a prime location, has very friendly, helpful and well informed staff, we were given a clean, cozy and well maintained room with two comfortable beds, and had free parking plus a well above average continental breakfast included in our  thinking of other North American cities  surprisingly decent if not low rate. Its a place that made us feel good in a large city unknown to us. What better a starting point can you ask for? We loved it there and would (and hopefully will) return there any time. Highly recommended!	
Sep 1 2008 	Hôtel très sympathique		
May 7 2007 	Great experience !	I stayed at the Clarion from may 4th to may 6th, 2007, (2 nights) with my boyfriend. At the check-in, it was a bit long because the girl at the front desk was alone. But she was very friendly and did some jokes with the people. No problem with my reservation, already paid so I took the electronic cards for my room and I went to it, on the 9th floor. This room was very clean, nice bed and big windows. It was a junior suite with a queen size bed, non-smoking. The window can be opened (it's like a patio-door). You have also a little kitchen with everything you need to cook a light meal, but a note advise you to clean the kitchen, because if it's not clean when you're leaving, a 25$ can be charged on your account. In front of the bed there's a tv with cable-channels, and paying-movies (like 11.99$ CAD for a movie... no thanks). Even if we were not that high, the view was great (take a look at my pictures). You already know that it is a great location because everyone said it before, and it's true. A lot of restaurants, stores, bars, supermarkets, etc. Near to metro Guy and metro Atwater (Place Alexis-Nihon, a great underground mall). Of course, 2 tiny elevators for more than 20 floors, it's not the best. But I took the stairs 2 times and it wasn't that bad, sometimes we were 5 in the elevator but some others times I didn't wait and I was alone. There's a laundry room working with change, that's good. The bathroom is very, very clean. I paid 123$ tax included per night, and it was quiet, even if there was a lot of people. The maid I talked to was polite, friendly and nice. The check-out was faster than the check-in, there was two girls at the front desk. We enjoyed our week-end and would go there again. Thanks for reading me and contact me if you have questions!	
Mar 16 2004	good value		
Jan 25 2008 	Good Moderate Hotel	We stayed one night in a room on the Club level. The room was very comfortable and nicely decorated. It looked like it had been recently renovated and, because it was a Club room, it had upgraded amenities and features like free wireless internet. The location was great, right in the heart of the city but this made for expensive parking. It was abou $20/day to park and the underground lot was always very full and very hard to park in because the spots were tiny. The front of the hotel wasn't very welcoming because there wasn't a driveway or anything so it was kind of awkward if you wanted to let passengers out in front because you had to just block traffic.But good service, good quality accommodations and great value for money.	
Nov 17 2005	Large rooms dismal decor!	I stayed at the Delta Montreal in October. It was one of the preferred hotels for a large medical conference I was attending. I got a good package deal on Expedia including airfare which was much less expensive than the &quot;conference rate.&quot; The lobby is small but very nice with marble floors. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I was able to take a tour of Montreal right from the hotel which the concierge recommended which was definitely worth doing if you're not familiar with the city.The rooms were very large and had two queen beds. The beds were comfortable with soft sheets. Oddly enough, there was absolutely no artwork anywhere in the room which gave it an institutional feeling.The patio, as mentioned by other reviewers, was a dismal slab of concrete overlying not much of a view (primarily of another building). However the setup of the building gives each room a private patio because the room is &quot;L&quot; shaped around the patio. There was one small dirty plastic chair but the weather was so cold I wouldn't have sat there anyway!I had a nice lunch there since I only had a few minutes to get a bite to eat. Service was pleasant and efficient. They had nice toiletries in the bathroom and a large marble bathroom.I would only stay there again if I got another great deal. Many of my workmates paid about $225 Canadian which was the &quot;conference rate&quot;. My deal came out to just over $100 a night and I wouldn't pay more than this. This is a 3 star at best.	
Jun 26 2009 	Outstanding in every way -- EXCEPT breakfast	When I booked our room through the Hilton website, I was a little concerned about what we would find, given that our rate was almost too good to be true. I needn't have worried: this hotel is a gem! Our suite had more room than we knew what to do with, a bed that was the most comfortable hotel bed that I've slept in in years, fireplace, and plenty of closets. The bathroom was enormous, with a great whirlpool tub, separate lighted makeup mirror for my wife, and a ton of plush towels. The corner shower was a bit cramped, however.Best part of this hotel? The front staff. You couldn't ask for a friendlier, more helpful, more cheerful and more welcoming group of people! Commendations to all!So why am I giving this property an overall rating of &quot;4&quot; instead of a &quot;5&quot;? The breakfast. The weekend of our stay, chaos reigned. On the two mornings that we ate here, the restaurant ran out of dishes, ran out of silverware, ran out of breads, ran out of decaf coffee, served food that was mediocre at best and inedible at worst -- and ran out of basic customer service. When my wife asked a server if he would make more decaf, he replied &quot;No&quot; and walked away. It took management's intervention to fix that one. We skipped the hotel's breakfast on our last morning and ate at the Eggspectation around the corner -- pricey but worth it. We were told that the Embassy's food service is contracted out and that this was a new vendor on a 6-month tryout. Let's hope that they find a new vendor real soon.Will we return to the Embassy? Absolutely! It's quality, location, friendliness and value are superb. And maybe we'll get a decent breakfast on our next visit.	
Oct 22 2008 	Very nice with a few buts . . .	We stayed at Embassy Suites Montreal for 6 days in the early part of October, 2008. There were lots of upsides to the hotel, and a few, relatively trivial downsides. First, the good.We found the hotel was in excellent shape, as it should have been given that it was less than 2 years old. Our accommodation, a large one-bedroom king suite, overlooked Rue St Antoine, was light, bright and very spacious, and completely insulated us from any noise in the street. We didnt look into the rear-facing suites, but they would only have looked out onto the blank wall of a building behind, and so would not have been so light as ours was.Everything in the suite was spotless, from the kitchen (equipped with a microwave oven, a dishwasher and an enormous refrigerator, but no stove) through the bedroom and living room to the roomy bathroom.The suite was equipped with two flat-screen television sets, and there was more than adequate lighting for activities during the evenings. The king bed was simply magnificent, as were the bed linens and pillows. There was an adequate supply of high-quality towels and toiletries in the bathroom.The breakfast (included in the room rate) was excellent  a better than average cold buffet of cereals, juices, fruits and breads, plus there was a person on hand to cook eggs to your liking, from fried through to self-defined omelette. In the hot buffet, there were pre-cooked scrambled eggs available, together with bacon, sausages and potatoes.The lobby was spacious, nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. Overall a pleasant place to sit for a while and watch the world go by. The reception staff were friendly and very helpful. Each evening, a managers reception was held in the lobby/restaurant, at which a free drink was handed out and an array of dips and vegetables was made available  nice after a day of trekking the city.The location of the hotel cant be faulted  less than a 10 minute walk to old Montreal and the old port, and also less than a 10 minute walk to the main shopping area on Rue St Catherine, Chinatown, the Latin Quarter, Museum of Modern Art, the Village and so on. The Place dArmes metro station (Orange line) is almost directly across the road and from here you can easily get to most of the central area using the Montreal souterrain  the underground network of about 30 Km of walkways connecting shopping areas  perfect if its raining or snowing.For the downsides  not too much. The main problem for us was that despite the presence of the kitchen, and its being advertised as a self-catering accommodation, there was practically zero in the kitchen by way of self-catering equipment  just 4 coffee mugs, 2 water glasses and 2 wine glasses. No cutlery, no crockery, no microwave cooking dishes, nothing. We eventually found out that everything was available from housekeeping if you asked. However, dishwasher detergent seemed not to be available, so the drill was to leave dirty things in the sink and housekeeping would take them away each morning. Big but - housekeeping wouldnt replace things (including the original complement of mugs and glasses). So, each day you had to ask all over again. This seemed to us to be silly waste of peoples time and effort. There was a deal of building activity going on in the immediate area, and this could be noisy and dirty, though we couldnt hear anything from our suite.Finally, the concierge function seemed to us to be seldom present, and not very knowledgeable about the city when they were there. We found the front desk to be much more useful.Overall, an excellent place to stay if you have some time in Montreal.	
Aug 24 2008 	Nice	A little late on my review but better late then never. Good place to stay. Clean, pleasant staff (even helped me with a little French, of course make sure you ask when it isn't busy). Good location although my agenda made me drive everywhere but that's not due to bad location. Night club in a high rise across the street brought interesting people into the area, also because it was a long weekend people were out playing. Parking was available at $25 a day. I tried my luck and parked on the street but the morning of the last day (labor day, monday holiday) I got a $150 parking ticket. OMG! 1) I guess parking restrictions apply on this holiday 2) there were separate signs for this restriction at 6-9 am aside from the other sign for restrictions for the rest of the day and don't forget the signage for the parking spot # and where to pay. 3 signs for one set of parking spaces. 3) the ticket was 5 minutes after 6 am so they must have been just waiting for us tourists to mess up, I wasn't the only one. 4) $150!!!! even in NYC isn't as steep. Not the hotels fault but shame on you Montreal!	
Dec 16 2007 	Very convenient stay	We stayed here recently for six nights since my husband had a conference on the premises. He said the conference facilities were good. The check in was friendly and efficient.They gave us a room with the criteria we requested, however we didn't realize how small it was. If one doesn't mind a cozy room it would be fine. But for my husband who has claustrophobia it was not suitable for the length of time we'd be staying. (I must admit that it was even smaller than any rooms I've stayed in when traveling in Europe) So we requested a switch to a larger room. Fortunately one was available, and they gladly switched us. We were very happy with our spacious and comfortable larger room on the top floor with a nice view. The restroom was on the small side but it was adequate enough. As a member of the Fairmont club we also were not charged for the Internet connection and had free local phone calls and a newspaper delivered. We consulted the concierge for restaurant suggestions/bookings during our stay and they were all very professional and helpful. We ate at the Montrealis (one of their hotel restaurants) a couple times during our stay and were very satisfied. Great salad and dessert bar. They also have a five star restaurant in the hotel that we considered,however we did not try. On the lower level there is a health club with up to date exercise equipment, spa and indoor pool. I did use this a couple times and was glad it was there. There is a gift shop off the lobby where you can also get beverages and yummy pastries. One big advantage of this hotel is its location. There is an underground city right below the hotel with food courts, boutiques, etc. so it is convenient to not have to go outside in the winter. I liked the option of grabbing a reasonable breakfast there instead of eating in the more expensive hotel restaurant every day. The hotel is also above the train station. If you stayed here during the summer where it is more pleasant to walk outside you could walk to Old Montreal, or other sites downtown. Finally the check out was quick and efficient. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, as long as I could be assured we'd get the same sized room.	
Jan 3 2007 	Very nice hotel / Great Location	We stayed here over New Years Eve Weekend. I booked it through tourisme-montreal.com and their Sweet Deals special (pay full price one night get 2nd night 50%). the Queen Elizabeth was one of only a few who honored the special rate over the holiday weekend.We had a standard room, King sized bed. my fiance thought the room was small but it was very nice and very clean (which is very important to us).they also provided good information about Montreal in the room. a tourism book and a great map of the city streets that was handy.Staff were very nice and professional and I would certainly stay at this hotel again.	
Aug 15 2009 	Magnifique		
Aug 31 2009	If you don't like noises don't come to this hotel.	We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights this past weekend. We were first given a room right by the staircase, so we went and exchanged for another room which again was near another staircase. Lots of noises of people talking on their cell phone late at night and cleaning ladies chatting loud during the day. We just gave up on exchanging for rooms figuring it is probably the same everywhere. We found 2 spiders in our room. There was a spider web in the bathroom. The bed was a bit too soft for our taste and will not work for anyone with back problems. The location is ok. It's right in the downtown financial district. The neighbourhood was pretty dead when we were there. But for the price we paid, it is not bad. We will not go back to this hotel however.	
May 18 2007 	ideal location	We stayed for one night in May 07.We booked the day before and arrived late morning to enquire if we could leave luggage and car to avoid further parking costs. To our pleasant surprise we were booked in and given a room straight away.Surprisingly the room was a suite with kitchen and seating area etc. It was very clean and roomy. The breakfast was good and plentiful with alot of choice for a continentalThe staff were a mine of information and very willing to help especially the valet parking attendent we would have missed places if it was not for him.The location is ideal for the old town.Down side is the cost of parking	
Aug 19 2008 	Rooms smell horrible	We stayed at this hotel through an airline voucher when our flight was cancelled. I know the hotel was busy at that time, but the first room we were given had an overwhelmingly smoky and musky smell. The kind of smell that permeates everything and ferments over twenty years in the carpets, drapes, etc. We asked for a new room, but the second one was just as bad-smelling. On top of that, the check-in staff were rude, the bathroom was dirty and all our clothing stunk badly when we got home. I would say this is barely a two star hotel. Definitely not recommended.	
Aug 24 2008 	Do NOT stay here!! Dirty and noisy!!!!	Upon arrival, only the linen seemed clean. There were hairs, old bar soap and paper stuck to the bathroom floor. Carpet in room was OBVIOUSLY not vaccuumed. We could write our names in the dust (top of television). Their excuse? - the cleaning lady had only worked there for 3 days - and that should be MY problem?Temperature was 26ºC in room. We had to place a maintenance call for a/c, as well as for someone to come clean the room. My friends also booked a room on the same floor - no a/c, and the carpet were not cleaned. Our room was very small (2 beds). We awoke several times throughout the night, as we could hear the &quot;neighbours&quot; urinate in THEIR room - need I mention how noisy their showers and toilets were? The walls are paper thin, no doubt. We were assured that this hotel had undergone major renos - I cannot imagine the condition of this place prior to the renos! I say FIRE the contractors! We will NEVER stay at this hotel EVER again - ever!	
May 24 2003	Hated the Midtown Montreal		
Nov 23 2005	This place is AWFUL	I stayed at this hotel with my husband. Everything about this place was terrible. The ceiling was leaking, it smelled of mold. I asked for a better room and the guy at the desk said 'I don't have they key to the good room.'	
Apr 22 2006	A very good hotel	I think a dose of realism is required here so let me try to give a balanced review. I read ALL of the reviews and from doing so it's easy to expect some kind of heaven on earth here. But a modern 30 room hotel in the centre of a city like Montreal is unlikely to be THAT good, it just isn't possible. Having said that, I've still given it 5 stars because it's not far off as good as it could be and the things that are not perfect don't knock it down to 4 stars. We are fairly fussy. We stayed at various small inns on our 16 night trip (all with several 5 star reviews on Tripadvisor) and one very expensive hotel at Mont Tremblant. The Gault is a very good place to stay in Montreal. The location is good, Andre is a very personable and helpful guide. We said what we wanted and he booked us 3 excellent meals - Chez L'Epicier (very good food in imaginative dishes in the old town), The Globe (a 'scene' restaurant with a ridiculously noisy DJ, waitresses who look like models and very good food) and the best - O Chalet a new restaurant with a funny 70s camping theme which could have been tacky but actually was rather stylish and the food absolutely superb. Once place we found on our own was for excellent brunch - Le Cartet, 106 Mc Gill.Our room was mid-range, it's admittedly very modern here (minor criticism) but it did have excellent ameneties - a lovely bed, wired free internet access (wifi doesnt work too well through concrete walls), excellent shower, funky storage. Breakfast is a very good buffet but the chairs and tables are not the most practical (minor criticism). The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The location is fine. I've got to say we were rather disappointed with Montreal, perhaps it's over-hyped. The best things we found were various interesting structures - the Geodesic Dome on the island, right out of science fiction; the sports stadium (you can't miss it if you go up to Mont Royal, just look for the spaceship); a building around the corner from the hotel made of coloured glass; the industrial buildings and ships down at the docks. Anyway if you're staying in Montreal this is a very good hotel. If I was going again I'd probably look at other reviews on Tripadvisor but might end up back at the Gault anyway since you can't go wrong there. Hope this helps.	
Jan 3 2006	Perfect	This hotel was amazing! Friendly and helpful staff. Great location. Fabulous room. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.	
Jun 14 2005	Cool classy oasis in a busy city	My wife and I stayed at the Gault during Grand Prix weekend (our second stay here) and what a great way to enjoy the weekend. Close enough to the action by Metro, taxi or on foot, yet a world away from the crowds. The other reviews are accurate, we really can't add much. When we checked out, they asked us to complete a survey. One question asked was &quot;improvements needed?&quot;. Our reply - NONE.	
Jul 6 2004	Great Location - Needs Paint Carpeting Cleaning	A group of us went up for the July 4th weekend. We decided to book at the Bourbon based on their website and great location. We did read the trip advisor ratings of this propery well after we booked our trip and were a bit concerned over the cleanliness, but decided as a group that we would &quot;check it out&quot; for ourselves. I am always amazed on how bad a place can be in the heart of a gay community where we as a segment of the population always likes and demands better. Here is our critique. We had a large suite and a junior suite. Both suites were spacious with lots of room. The larger suite's AC was broken all weekend. The cooler weather made it bearable. Both suites could use new carpeting, as the stains are becoming more numerous then the actual color of the rug. Linens and curtains should be replaced as they have seen better days. New paint would make both suites better and the hotel a much better place to stay. The cleaning staff should be re-trained or even trained and probably paid better as they can do a much better job at cleaning. The hallway carpeting should be ripped up and replaced either with new carpeting or tile. It's just sooo dirty, that the red color is now more a black carpet that is tinted red. We have certainly stayed at worst places in different cities, but at a much cheaper price. At the Bourbon Montreal, you are paying a premium for the location and not for the condition of the hotel. If cleanliness is a concern, the Bourbon Montreal is not for you.A few words of advice for the owners. I would remove the word luxury from all of our brochures and website. I would remove the pictures of the rooms and really just show more of a diagram of the rooms. People will get the wrong impression from your pictures. You should also look into redoing the rooms. Gay people will pay an even bigger premium knowing that they are not only get a GREAT location, but really decent room as well.	
Nov 2 2009 	One of The Best by a Mile!!!	We were visiting for a hockey game at the Bell Centre. The location was perfect. The Service was excellent. Extra Umbrella's for the rain. Robes and Slippers in the Room. Every kind of Toiletry product you could imagine. Fluffy pillows and a throw on the sofa. The best hotel sofa that I have sat on. They are usually so uncomfortable. The Espresso Machine was a really nice touch as well. Our really sweet maid Karen, got us cream from the kitchen on her lunch break for the coffee.I loved the seperate bedroom which stayed nice and dark for sleeping in. The hotel is in walking distance to everything. I don't understand the person that complained about a store. There are several within 100 steps of the hotel. The closest is the esso station, but Shoppers Drug Mart and several other conenience stores are very close. If you like Italina I wasn't sure about the mixed reviews of Il Campari Centro across the street so we walked over to Bishop and ate at Davinci's. It was awesome. Ask for a higher floor to avoid the hockey crowd or club crawler noise.	
Nov 26 2009 	Divine.	Everything about this hotel was simply divine, I have nothing bad to say about it what-so-ever. It's gorgeous, and it has very well-trained staff, and the food is amazing. It's ramontic elegance, with modern chic added in. Exquisite.	
Aug 4 2008 	Great Location	This is a lovely small and very personal hotel in an excellent location with great staff and lovely service. The staff couldn't have been more helpful from recommending what to see and to to booking an excellent restaurant (Boris Bistro but you do need to book in advance).	
Jul 22 2008 	Whoa Nellie!	The Nelligan is the wonder horse everyone claims it to be!My wife and I stayed at the Nelligan for three nights using the Montreal Sweet deal packageWe made our reservation using the hotels web site---after a problem with the site the manager quickly solved our reservation problem and upgraded our room. We stayed in a King Deluxe room and it was excellent. Clean, spacious, exposed brick, deep stone windows, fireplace, superb king bed, turn down service, robes, thick towels and massive bathroom and double jacuzzi tubBreakfast --served in the amazing atrium--was continental, the pain au chocolat were yummy and the coffe and tea very nice. The nightly wine and cheese were a nice bonus, although the last two nights a little too loud because of a conference group at the hotelThe hotel staf were old school throwbacks--we have only had this type of service in Washington DC--holding open doors, supplying umbrellas, quality information and an ever positive attitudeWe loved Old Montreal--recommend seeing Notre Dame, the walking tour---take the walking tour first, as it includes a return admission to Notre Dame. We rented bikes from Ca Roule--just around the corner---solid bikes and a great way to see Montreal. The Museum of Fine Arts has a nice Moderns collection as wellHad dinner at Modavie(recommend for Jazz and quiet romance), Restaurant holder (decent food and good for a loud group) and Boris Bistro (have the duck risotto)We will return to the Nelligan	
Oct 14 2003	elegant understated Hotel Nelligan		
May 9 2009 	Bonne surprise		
Apr 20 2007 	Great Stay	Our stay was April 17&amp; 18th and after encountering horrible weather conditions and a long drive we were thankful to finally reach our destination and was looking forward to relaxing at the Omni. Front desk was friendly , check in was speedy and our request for a kingbed/highfloor/city view/smoking was honored. We are a select member and the extra touches are greatly appreciated.......morning beverage,chocolate treat, newspaper,turn down service with weather report and chocolates ! We were on the 30th floor and the city view was marvelous..we moved our couch across from the window and enjoyed the night skyline . Room wasn't huge but it had a couch/desk /tv armoire coffee maker table, large round table and one chair. Mini bar was used as a bed night table....clever use of space. King bed was very comfortable with a nice down blanket cozied between two sheets. Bathroom was basic but very clean with an added bidet perhaps? hahaha could have been for the guys to use..I'm just not sure. We took advantage of the outdoor pool the next morning as it was a nice sunny day. A dip in the hot tub afterwards was just what we needed.The spa/gym pool area is quite nice, especially the locker room that carries the little extras such as shaving foams, hairspray, body deodorants and washes , cotton balls q-tips , hair dryer etc.to use after a workout.The only downfall was at the time of check in they ran out of minibar keys which we could have used after our drive however we just scooted to the bar and had a drink there instead and forgot to ask for one on our way back to the room Also..we didn't receive bathrobes which I could have put to use, but no biggy ! Our room was very clean and service all around was great. It's those little touches mentioned above that make the Omni a wonderful place to stay in my opinion. On leaving... the doorman was very informative on directions and I left feeling like I should just turn around and check back in again. I will make sure to book a spa treatment before I arrive next visit so its already on my schedule :) Never enough time !	
May 23 2009 	Facile à trouver et prix convenable		
May 18 2008	Really good hotel	My friends and I stayed at Hotel St. Denis in March 2006, and I'm just getting around to writing a review now. It is very good value for money. I think we paid about $75.00/room per night. The rooms were clean, well maintained and elegant. The location is in the heart of downtown Montreal. There is a lovely restaurant next door that serves a great breakfast. I would highly recommend it.	
Jun 11 2006	Great Location and Budget Friendly	My rating might seem high as it's based on the fabulous location/proximity to transportation and area attractions as well as the first rate front desk staff.The rooms are what they are. They are small, the bedding and towels are clean but well used and the bathroom situation is not ideal. The sink basin in our room was located outside the bathroom right next to the front door and the floor below it got wet easily. There is also no counter space. The water closet itself is literally no larger than your bathub at home. You open the door and the toilet and shower stall (the size of a cruise ship one) are face to face with little room to move.That said, parking is located in a garage around the block (on Rue Christin) and is easy to use (no attendant, you get a ticket pass from the hotel and go in/out as you please). The location is right off UQAM and the Berri subway station and you can walk easily to the Underground City, shopping and Vieux Montreal. It's also quite easy to get to locations outside the immediate area by car (e.g. Biodome, Parc Mont-Royal).The front desk staff is helpful, multi-lingual and especially good about giving directions and answering questions about attractions.	
Mar 23 2009 	It is a business hotel - nothing fancy nothing terrible.	This hotel is located just a few minutes from downtown, Chinatown old Montreal. The hotel looks like it had a renovation 5+ years ago. The lobby area is well decorated and pleasant. The rooms themselves were also renovated, although it doesn't look like they put much money into them just a refreshing. The hotel itself looks like a large block of concrete. While I dont think it will any architectural awards, it is not as ugly from the outside as some previous posts have suggested. The hotel sits above a large shopping mall (and has direct access without having to go outside). This is very convenient. There is a large food court, wine store and an IGA supermarket (as well as the usual mall brands). My review is in part influenced by the fact that I got a very, very cheap rate on Hotwire for this hotel (a fraction of the advertised rate). If I had to pay full rates for this hotel I would have shopped around to see if I could find a better hotel for the same money. The bottom line is this: this is a business hotel. You wouldnt stay here if you were looking for an amazing service experience (try the W hotel or Intercontinental instead). However, if you are looking for a business hotel which has what you need and wont break the bank, this is a good candidate.	
Apr 27 2006 	Mostly bad experience	I stayed at the Hyatt for a week, and I have to say it was a mostly negative experience. The good:1) Location. You are above a mall/underground walkways that can take you to the conference center, and many other locations. You can easily walk to old Montreal. There's a grocery store and food court in the mall that's right downstairs (well, two elevators away!) 2) Water pressure. You can't see yourself in the dark washroom, but the hot water has lots of pressure.3) Soaps (when you get them) are not bad quality - not the best, but certainly usable. The bad:1) Housekeeping. They don't refill empty shampoo, conditioner, etc etc. I am staying here a week, and went a couple days without roomservice, and only took down the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign when I needed refills, as I'm in and out of the room for a conference. So I'm completely out of shampoo and the bottles are left empty in an obvious place - and they don't refill anything. I had to call for refills. They also don't replace toilet rolls, or the tea/coffee in your room. As I'm paying $200 per night, bit annoyed not having tea/coffee in the morning... I phoned and an hour later someone arrived with some items. Also, the fitted sheet issue others mention here -- so true. I cannot believe that they use a flat sheet on the beds. Woken up every morning on a bare mattress - ew. Other things were tidied up at least. 2) Room Service. Costly room service menu, limited hours. I guess I'm used to the Hilton that's open really late (the only reason I order room service is when I need to eat odd hours due to conventions!). But the price - huge price tag on the food, and then they tack on $3 service fee and taxes on top. Also, service was LATE both times -- they said they would bring my food at a certain time and were late by at least 10 minutes each time. (Not bad, but when you're on a schedule for meetings, it can throw things off.)ALSO - they advertise &quot;freshly squeezed orange juice&quot; on the menu (at $5), which is worse than Tropicana. It's seriously generic-brand concentrate grade. Stay away, or set your expectations low.Other than that, the people who brought the food were friendly.3) Elevators. They were out of service at times, which meant long waits. Oddly laid out too - a separate elevator takes you up from street level to the lobby. A different elevator takes you up to the rooms. A third elevator takes you down to the mall. More inconvienent is that the stairs seem to be for emergencies only. I am on the first floor above the lobby - so I've had to take the elevator just to go down a single floor (before getting on a second eleavator to go anywhere else). Very annoying. 4) Bathrooms - The lighting. Not bad if you're there for a night - but a whole week it gets on your nerves. One small light over the mirror. Oddly placed so it's awkward to put your make-up on (awkward in that you get shadows all over your face and cannot see.) That's a minor inconvienience. It's the fact that it's completely dark everywhere else in the bathroom. I guess this helps hide any grime anywhere else... 5) No full-length mirror, no safe, (and naturally, no fridge). No mirror is annoying on a business trip for sure. Attending a professional workshop and conference, you want to make sure you look presentable - but it's pretty difficult as there are no full legnth mirrors anywhere to be found (in the room or halls, etc). A safe is a big one for me though - for business I have all kinds of gadgets with me I want to lock up when not in the room all day. Every other hotel I've been in over the past few years has had in-room safes - not here.First time I've felt the need to search out a review site to vent. I can't see returning here ever (looks like some nice smaller hotels in old montreal - think I'd consider something like that next time), and don't think I'd go to another Hyatt without some research beforehand.	
Aug 15 2005	Great stay	Stayed there during the grand prix week-end. Very friendly and professional staff, a decent breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms, brand new bathrooms. We had a regular room and it was just what you would expect from a good quality hotel - clean, spacious, nice beds, convenient location (stayed all over the world - had better, but this is what you pay for in this case). I was a bit concerned having read some of the negative reviews on this site, but had a good time and no problems at all. Highly recommended for either a business or a private stay.And yes, Montreal is French-speaking. They speak English at the hotel fine, but nobody is expected to speak English, where other languages are official.	
Sep 10 2009	Unpretentious excellent value for the money	I initially hesitated to book this hotel based on some bad reviews I read. But then I noticed most of the negative reviews from from 2008 and most complained about bed bugs. However seeing responses from the hotel management allayed my fears enough to give this place a try--and I came away pleasantly surprised! The room was spacious, unpretentious, and very clean (except maybe the carpet). The location is ultra convenient--right in the middle of downtown and within walking distance of McGill University where I was delivering my daughter. The small but tidy kitchen was a nice touch, as was the bistro-like seating for two in the eating area. The two minor issues I encountered (burned out light bulb and missing bath towels) were corrected on the spot by the front desk. And the price! I was saying to my wife that I haven't paid this little ($79) for a hotel room since staying at the Penny Sleeper Inn 21 years ago at Disneyland! So what are the negatives? Well, there are many signs that you are indeed staying in a budget hotel: there was no coffee or tea bags in the room, despite the presence of a coffee machine. The TV looked like it was from the '80s--an old 24&quot; tube model with maybe a dozen channels--all of them fuzzy. The windows bore obvious signs of condensation damage. The air conditioner was loud (but effective during the heat wave). And the aforementioned carpet--I was hesitant to take off my shoes even. But like I tell people--what do you expect for a sub $100 room--in the middle of downtown in a major city? And for 79 bucks, this was an absolute steal. I will definitely return the next time we're in Montreal to visit our daughter. One final thing: I've been back over two weeks now and no sign of bed bug bites. That's the best sign yet.	
Sep 27 2009 	Awful	I have stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world and consider this to be one fo the worst of all time. When we arrived one elevator wasn;t working so we had to lug suitcases up 11 (ELEVEN !!) flights of stairs. The rooms were sparce, not cleaned properly (nor were they on each consecutive morning), the staff we not so bad on reception and the location adjacent to China town were the only lus points. The beds and bedding were uncomfortable, no facilities for food or drink within the hotel - only a supermarket built in downstairs. Very disappointing.	
Jun 8 2009 	Great Place to Stay in Montreal	Great service over all. We wanted a cab, they called one up right away and we went to Rue Crescent (where English speaking bars are) for about $10 CAD. The walk back was about 15 minutes.Hotel has a modern look, great view. Bed sheets were clean, so was the bathroom. It was quiet and I had a good night sleep, even though we were on a main street. There was a small TV, lots of cabinet space, big desk and sink. The temp. in the room is cold, but you need to know how to work the thermostat. I cranked mine up to 26C with no problem. One bad thing is no parking - you have to go a block or two to the underground one which will run you about $20CAD for night.	
Apr 16 2009 	Le 1 Rene Levesque hotel offers all the comforts of a 3-4 star hotel but without the spending guilt.	Our room had a stovetop, microwave and small fridge/freezer along with plenty of storage for groceries. The bed was quite comfortable and we had a lovely view of Old Montreal and Chinatown. The bathroom was small but had enough room to move around easily and was well stocked with soap, shampoo and towels. The highlight of the hotel is that it is extremely clean. I am often called a neat-freak so the fact that I was happy with the cleanliness says a lot. Le 1 Rene Levesque has a sleek modern design, yet still feels warm and comfortable. We were visiting Montreal to shop, eat, drink and explore and we were able to do all of these things by foot because of 1 Rene Levesques close proximity to the heart of downtown Montreal as well as Old Montreal. Le 1 Rene Levesque doesnt provide linen spray, eye masks or shoe polishers. It doesnt have a pool, wood furniture or fancy curtains (although there is a blind to block the light). It does, however, provide everything you NEED which is exactly what you pay for. So while luxurious is not necessarily a word I would use to describe Le 1 Rene Levesque, I will say that the cleanliness, location, convenience, and cost exceeded my standards and I will certainly return to this hotel every time I visit Montreal. There is simply no better value.	
May 28 2002	Great Service Great Location		
Oct 8 2009 	Fine hotel not perfect	This hotel had a comfortable bed and a lot of space. The room was clean. And the location was good, in the center of the city and a short walk to the subway. However, we were on a non-smoking floor with smokers right below us. When our downstairs neighbors smoked, it was vented into our bathroom. The front desk offered to spray some scented spray as a solution, we preferred smoke to chemicals. The safe didn't work and the front desk offered no viable solution until we insisted they keep our valuables for us.Overall a comfortable hotel, but not perfect.	
May 27 2004	Great spot in Montreal	I stayed at Le Nouvel Hotel this past long weekend with my girls. I read the reviews before I went and I must say that the people who had a bad experience I feel for, but my experience was the complete opposite. The staff were friendly (especially the male staff); when I requested more towels I got towels in less than two minutes. The room was clean and pleasantly decorated (not chic, but not tacky). The washroom was spotless and the linens clean which are the two most important things for me. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It's just around the corner from Crescent street and St. Catharine (the entertainment and shopping havens) and only a $5-10 cab to St. Laurent. For those of you considering staying at the Quality Suites on Crescent street -- BEWARE!! It costs a bit more than Le Nouvel Hotel and you could see, feel and smell the brothel-like mist that floats around this run-down hotel. If you want a clean room, better price and relatively same location (and no creatures of the night!) stay at Le Nouvel Hotel. It's not the Ritz, but it's a great place on a budget. I would stay again in a second even if I'm not on a budget!Oh and when you get to Montreal, remember you want the Nouvel Hotel not the Novetel (right around the corner). Tres confusing!	
Jul 12 2008	Excellent hotel	We just returned from a four night stay at the St. Sulpice and could not have been more pleased. We were able to walk wherever we wanted to go, even to the main stage of the jazz festival (20 min walk), and to any of a number of excellent bistros, the metro, and tourist attractions.Our rooms were spacious and immaculate and the beds very comfortable. Our windows faced the lovely garden restaurant in the inner courtyard and we had no problem with noise at all. The air conditioning was in excellent working order.Service was impeccable from the moment we checked in. I called and made arrangements for a large suite (party of 4), and we were delighted with our accommodations. We stayed in a one bedroom with a queen bed, queen pullout sofa, and queen Murphy bed. The rooms were light and airy with a small kitchen area/wet bar. The bedroom was a little small, but with the living area, it didn't really matter.A word of advice if you are arriving by car: it is more cost effective to self park at any number of locations in the area. We found the lot the hotel uses and while the daily rate through the hotel was $32/night, when we parked ourselves, we were charged $18/day by the lot.We did not have dinner in the restaurant, but we did breakfast there everyday as a continental buffet was offered with the room rate (for 2), and we found it to be sufficient, but there are numerous cafes in the area which offer more cost effective alternatives if breakfast is not included with your room.When I return to Montreal, I will definitely return to the Saint Sulpice.	
Jan 15 2007 	Rooms were excellent and super super clean!!	I just got back this weekend from a two night stay here with 4 friends. This hotel was excellent. The room was impeccable and the services were quick. Like others said though, parking is $19 per night per car, and i had two cars ugh. Also they hit you up with all kinds of canada taxes. WARNING!! I booked thru Hotels.com for the rate of $132 CAD per nite and at checkout i look and the bill is $162 CAD per nite. Now the front desk was super nice about helping me out with this problem, in the end he finally said he could do the special weekend rate for me @ $138 CAD per night.	
Jul 17 2006	Great Room Great Service	My wife, six year old son, and I spent three nights at Le Square Phillips. Our one bedroom suite was spacious and spotless. The front desk and conceirge staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast (standard fare of fruits, cereals, breads) is served in a nice second floor dining room.We give the hotel high marks for sound proofing. Despite having small children for neighbors, we could not hear a sound between the rooms. The cleaning staff did a great job even cleaning the dishes in our kitchen sink (which we did not expect).The location was fantastic on a relatively quiet side street very close to multiple shopping malls and Metro stations. There are countless restaurant options close to the hotel.A heads-up on the rooftop pool for parents of young children. The pool has a uniform depth of roughly 1.5m. Our little guy was a little freaked out to not have a spot where he could touch bottom.	
Feb 1 2006 	Great great great!	My family - 2 kids, 2 adults - stayed there in January in a two bedroom suite. We were so pleased with the experience. As my kids say - it was awesome! It was &quot;low season&quot; in Montreal and very cold so we spent a lot of time in the hotel. We stayed for 13 nights for my husband's business. The rooms were absolutely huge with beautiful tall ceilings. We bought food at the IGA nearby and cooked some of our own in the kitchen, enjoyed the breakfast they provided every morning, used the small rooftop pool - there was never anyone there - the workout facilities and the laundry. I was impressed with all aspects of the hotel. It was close to Eaton's center and the Bay shopping malls, and on the same block as three fabulous restaurants. I highly recommend it, and would not have to even think twice about staying there again - it was unbelievable.	
Aug 17 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed here for 2 nights. Large Spacious room and good service located right in the center of Montreal. Highly Recomended	
Aug 19 2005	Berri Good Deal For A Short Trip	I stayed at the Lord Berri on a trip from my camp. I do not know how much money was spent per room, but it must have been a very low amount...LOBBY: The lobby of the hotel is very nice for lounging. There is a computer in the corner where you can get 15 minutes of internet access for $1CA, a very good deal compared to what I've seen in most hotels.ROOMS: The rooms were very large and the Air Conditioners were very responsive. You could set your temperature to anything and the air conditioner would work instantly. The TV got some good channels, mostly in french, which was not good for the all-english speaking camp tourgroup. It was interesting however to watch American shows with the French dubbed. You could imagine what they were saying, which was fun. Fridge/Freezer in each room was a nice touch, and unexpected to us.BATHROOM: Nice amenity kit for a budget hotel, including sewing kit, and Pantene Pro-V shampoos, one of the nicest I've seen in any hotel I've stayed at. The showers had good pressure and temperature, however there was a plastic wall that cut into the shower that I did not think was necessary. This was not providing the maximum showering space, which I did not like.BEDS: Very comfortable. I had a very nice sleep in the bed for the two nights I stayed there.DOWNSIDE...only one telephone, located no where near bed, making wake up calls a hassle to answer.LOCATION: A good location to all of the activities we were doing. Parking is adjacent to the hotel which provided a conveinent spot for the cars. Within walking distance from Old Montreal, which is a place to definitely check out. OVERALL: I only saw people in groups at the hotel, and I think the hotel does a good job at catering to groups. If you do not like a lot of children around the floors, Hotel Lord Berri is DEFINITELY the wrong hotel. If you don't mind children, and not having a pool or fitness center, Hotel Lord Berri is a great hotel.	
Aug 28 2005	loved the hotel	Just returned from a trip to Montreal,and stayed for 6 days in the MarriottChateau Champlain, very friendley Staff, Did not try the pool, Room was very nice, and private, Breakfast was excellant, Loved the decor of the Hotel, Bar was nice, Food very good.Bar Staff above avarage.Close to shopping,and sights.Overall I was delighted with this hotel.	
Aug 24 2007 	no frills no AC but clean and reasonably comfortable	Our family stayed in a corner suite during a conference that my husband attended. It had two rooms, a small kitchen, and a bathroom. Overall, the hotel was a hybrid between a hotel and dorm, that is, an upscale dorm (it used to be a hotel) or a slightly quirky hotel.My main complaint is that the air conditioners in both rooms were either lacking refrigerant or were disabled. They only worked as fans. It wasn't too hot when we were there, so we did not complain, but if it had been warmer, we would have.There wasn't a restaurant in the hotel except for the breakfast room, which was a lot like a college dining hall. The prices were high and the food mediocre (coffee terrible!) However, there are some nice bakeries and cafes and LOTS of nice restaurants in walking distance (Blvd St. Laurent). It was also a short walk to the Montreal Jazz Festival area and nearby museums.	
Nov 7 2007 	Good but not usual Novotel high standard	I stayed there for 6 nights at the end of October 2007 and my overall impression was positive and I would return again. However, it is not the usual Novotel standard or at least not the Novotel standard I am used to in Europe.The location on near corner of rue de la Montagne and rue Sainte-Catherine is very good. Close to bars, shops (underground city) and resturants. Although the neighbouring lots on rue de la Montagne arent great two car park across the road, building site to one side of hotel and a few vacant lots. But the area seemed safe to me.The foyer is small and can get crowded, with the décor being a little dated, as are the corridors leading to rooms, which are remind me of student halls of residence. Once inside your room, its a different matter. The rooms are spacious, well laid out and appointment is nice (if a little dated).My room was very large, had a king-sized bed, large working table (with pull out table extension), sofa (with pull out bed), large LCD TV, safe, mini-bar with small bar table top and a foot stool. The bathroom was reasonably large, with corner double doors, bath, WC and basin. Nice touch was a green glowing night light.Internet access is wired and $10 per 24 hours. Speeds ok, but not great. I was told there was wireless in foyer, but I didnt try it.I ate one meal in hotel  upon my arrival on Sunday night. Food was nice, nothing fantastic and service was very good. However, word of warning: I was told by supervisor that kitchen closed at 10pm and last orders were 9.30 so if you plan on being late be aware. However, there are many very nice restaurant on rue Crescent, directly behind the hotel.Breakfast was $15 (+ tax) extra, so I opted for one of the diners on rue Sainte-Catherine, which were much cheaper and more lively than the hotel. The bar was inside the restaurant and had no atmosphere  one of the worst hotel bars I have ever been in. But there are plenty of bars within a few minutes walk.I found the front desk staff to be helpful and pleasant. I had several queries while I was there and they were very good. On leaving, then even printed my flight boarding pass off my memory stick.	
Feb 6 2007	Great location!	Very clean room. Super close to the bell centre and lots of shopping.	
Jul 11 2006	Superb Location 	We were courteously and professionally checked in to our room upon arrival by a very friendly and welcoming staff member. Having called ahead to request a quiet room, our preferences were easily accommodated and we found ourselves in a good-sized - if a little tired - room overlooking the central courtyard away from the street and therefore the construction noise and traffic. Well located on de la Montagne, just below Ste Catherine and a few minutes' walk from Peel metro, this is an ideal location for those who want to be in the middle of Montreal's downtown. Steps away from many English-speaking visitors' idea of a good evening out, Crescent and Bishop are parallel to the hotel's street and it lies just north of the Bell Centre, the location for hockey games and concerts, etc. If convenience is a factor, the Novotel certainly is worth considering.A warning label about automatic billing from the mini bar was accompanied by a note suggesting we request a mini refrigerator from reception if we wished to keep our own drinks cool. This we did and, despite a confused-sounding staff member asking for our patience, we found said appliance installed and nicely cool upon our return later. Our room - 2 double beds - was very spacious and clean, although the decor was generic chain hotel in style, it provided us with comfortable, well air-conditioned accommodation downtown for our short stay there. The bathroom was also well-sized and, despite a less-than-spotless toilet and a could-be-fresher shower curtain, it was all very adequate. While it wont offer you the luxury or cachet of the Omni or Ritz Carlton, the Novotel does provide decent accommodation in a handy location in this ever-fascinating city.	
May 27 2009 	48 hours without any sleep!	Every room on our side of the hotel was over their night club, which had events both Saturday and Sunday night that lasted until after 3 a.m. in the morning. The ear plugs next to the bed did nothing to help with the fact that the room was vibrating. It was truly horrendous. The hotel itself is very nice, but for the price I'd expect to be able to get some sleep. Never again.	
Aug 5 2008 	Pretty shoddy.	This place is tatty and rather run down even though the room was large and the wired internet worked well.The hotel clearly runs on a tight budget, I gather they subcontract catering, the breakfast was a classic mug of coffee and prehistoric bagel. All this might have been tolerable because I thought it would be cheap. My colleagues and I had booked this hotel at a special conference rate. My colleague paid the bill and did not point out that they were charging some 50 canadian dollars per day more than the conference rate. I stayed on an extra day and when I came to pay I pointed out that they were charging more than the agreed rate and they were extremely unhelpful and uncooperative. I don't know if this over charging was an 'error' or not. I can say, however, that we could have stayed in a pleasant hotel for the price we ended up paying.On balance this is one to avoid.	
Feb 11 2007 	Good location and nice staff	Sept 17th 2006 (three nights)$119 CAD / nightMy boyfriend and I have decided to put this into good/not so good format. Were both fairly tall, he is 6ft and Im 5.8 and were both 29 years old.See our other comments on Jasper (Windswept B&amp;B); Banff (Rundlestone Lodge); Calgary (Quality Inn Calgary Airport); NYC (Manhatten Inn); Niagara (Americas Best Value Chalet Inn); London (Arran House); Brighton (Oriental Hotel); Paris (Hotel Familia); Barcelona (Barcelona City Centre Hostal); Venice (CaRiccio); Monterosso (La Spaggia); Florence (Cimatori Guesthouse); Sienna (Hotel Santa Caterina); Positano (Villa Nettono); Rome (The Beehive); Mykonos (Cavo Tagoo); Santorini (Porta Fira Suites); Athens (Art Hotel); Milan (Hotel Charly); Tokyo (Hotel Century Southern Tower); Kyoto (Kikokuso)Good:-We had to upgrade to a King from a Double as the bed was too short for my boyfriend.-the area is alright. Not dodgy, just not happenin; however, it is fairly close to train station and Greyhound bus station ($10 cab ride)-friendly staff and very accommodating-cheap restaurant in the hotel-everyone had good English-broadband available Not so Good:-Double beds are very small, dont stay if youre tall, we had to upgradeI would stay here again for sure.	
Apr 28 2007 	Cramped but Fine	When I first arrived, I was a bit surprised at how small and 'pokey' the reception area was. Check-in staff were fabulously welcoming, although once checked in there was a queue for the elevators which snaked back almost to the front door. The elevators, like the lobby were small and outdated and very very slow. The suite itself was much better than the first impression I had of the hotel led me to expect. A good, comfortable king bed, a great working desk with a seriously good chair enabling me to actually work comfortably and a good layout. The bathroom was so tiny, that you couldn't open the door if the bath mat was on the floor, but it was clean and perfectly adequate. The walls were paper thin - and fellow residents were particularly noisy - but it was hockey night, so it was all good natured. In all, it was a good value room in a good location, and for the purposes of a night or two, ideal for what I needed. Not altogether sure I'd be happy to stay their on a longer vacation. A colleague of mine stayed at the Clarion Suites, and the consensus of opionion was that the Residence Inn was by far the better option!	
Feb 8 2006 	First time in an Inn	We found this hotel and after reading all the reviews and deceided to stay there. As we were first time visitors to montreal found its location excellent. Shopping was convenient and a tourist centre nearby to obtain all my information and buy tour tickets. All the staff were friendly, room was clean and a good size. Buffet breakfast was ample and you even given containers if you wished to take some back to you room. We have no residence type hotels where we hail from and found this concept excellent. We will now try this type of accomadation the next time we visit Canada or the US.	
Dec 9 2008 	no so good  too far from the city	I didnt like this hotel at all , it was far from the city . our room wasnt clean and was smelly . stay away!!	
Jul 20 2007 	Good not Great	Nice lobby and bar (although the drinks are pricey) . The rooms are average. The pool area is nice enough.	
Jul 5 2006	Mixed feelings...	I stayed at Le Centre Sheraton for the July 4th weekend (4 nights) and left disappointed. First of all, I've stayed at this hotel a number of times, each time as a result from booking with either a Priceline or Hotwire. My previous visits have all been better than this most recent experience, so take note.My main complaint was that they put me in a smoking room. I don't smoke and never requested a smoking room, but the hotel insisted my reservation was for smoking. And because it was a popular weekend, the hotel was booked and they claimed they could not move me to a non-smoking room. They did offer to send an ionizer to my room, which did effectively nothing to the smell. On my return home, I contacted Hotwire and was told Hotwire cannot guarantee a non-smoking room, so beware if you use Hotwire.Aside from this issue, the room itself was fine except for the bathroom. Although they have begun some renovations to the hotel (the hotel bar is now much better than before) and the rooms (the bedspread was new), they really need to focus on updating the bathrooms.....our tub spout leaked daily, the reserve tank for the toilet overflowed a number of times, the florescent lighting over the sink was half out and the towels were badly in need of a replacement.On the good side, the location is ideal, particularly if you have an event at Centre Bell, and the views from the rooms are excellent. For the $90/night I generally pay through Hotwire/Priceline, I think the hotel is ok, but I highly doubt I'd pay the $200+/night and book direct.	
Dec 22 2007 	loved the stay	rooms are not that big..but loved everything else about it!! very very clean...convenient location, great environment and great staff...must stay!	
Jul 17 2005	Great for families 	Springhill Suites has a great location and excellent value for the money. Ambiance? Not much, but for a family or a business traveler, it has much to recommend it. Very clean and neat, with a little kitchenette, and a free, fabulous breakfast. Our 14-yr. old  whos a good 6 tall -- slept reasonably well on the twin sleeper sofa. Laundry facilities and a small pool w/hot tub are nice touches. We had some annoyances that were never resolved  one of our two wall-unit air conditioners roared like a jet engine, and while they came immediately to work on it, nothing changed, so we just used the other A/C on high, and it all worked out. The staff was friendly and very courteous. Our requests for light bulbs and extra pillows were handled quickly and cheerfully. We travel a lot, and this was one of the best hotels we've visited in a while. We would definitely stay here again.	
Sep 12 2007	A Great Experience	Our stay at the W was a great experience - although we rarely went to the vast lounges offered at the W we relied heavily on the concierge to point us in the right direction for food, drinking and shopping. Hugo was excellent and every recommendation was exceptional - including the lounges in Mount Royale. The service at the Hotel was great and everyone was incredibley polite and helpful - including our concierge who brought us bubble bath in a martini glass at 1am. We stayed in a Mega Room and ended up with a corner room - the view was fantastic. The location was right next to the metro and close to downtown and old montreal. Definately will stay here again.	
Mar 19 2007 	Do Not Stay Here!	My husband and I were booked to stay at this Hotel for what we thought was to be the ending of a nice romantic get-away - we thought wrong. Our whole reason for choosing this hotel was because my mom had recieved a complimentary night stay for being a Starwood Guest and passed it onto us - being leary of 'complimentary' type invitations, I called the hotel directly and asked to speak with someone about this before making a reservation. After reading them EXACTLY what the invitation said they assured me that it indeed meant we would have one free night and one free spa treatment. Excellent, right? Wrong! When we arrived and went to check in I gave the woman at the desk my free invitation and gift certificate and right away I was treated differently. She asked me to wait while she checked with her manager that this certificate was indeed valid. After a few moments she came out and told me that I would not be entitled to a free night stay unless we booked the 'AWAY SPA' package (a very expensive package I might add) and then we would be given a free night stay. I explained to her upon making my reservation I was not told about this, nor does it say anything like that on the certificate (there also was no footnotes, asteriks, see more details, etc. etc.) nor did it even REFER to such a thing as the AWAY SPA package!!!! I asked to speak to her manager, she came out and just reiterated exactly what previous person had told us. I told her we had travelled from Toronto (it was now evening) and had made a plan to stay there, and now we had no reservations to stay anywhere else! She simply didn't care! No apologies were offered, no special discounted accomodations (it was dead there btw, they could of given us a room!) - NOTHING! If you're looking for a place to cater to you (and treat you with respect) this place is not for you. I told her that if she was looking to cater to the 25-35 yr, professional crowd - she was seriously doing herself a disservice by treating us this way.	
Jan 5 2006	W - Not the best W but VERY NICE!	I am a platinum member w/ starwood for yearsso my room was upgradedit wasnt a suite, but large enough for two. The beds were clean and super comfortable w/ lots of pillows. The shower, yep, a see through, was swanky enough, but lack the water pressure. Other than that, the hotel was an exciting place to stay. A good bar on the first floor. Stay here if you are young and ready for some fun in a EU-like city. The down side is that you will have to pay $15 to park ($30 for valet).	
Jun 1 2009 	Fun sleek relaxing - a good deal near the airport	I have stayed here a few times now and have always had a really positive experience. The rooms are comfortable, clean, modern. Free wi-fi.No there isn't a restaurant, but you can get apps at the bar, and there is a vast selection of takeout menus at the front desk.The wxyz bar has a number of really fun cocktails and a good atmosphere. It was hopping on the Saturday night I was there. Pool area and gym are very nice - love the personal TVs in the cardio machines.Getting to the airport is a breeze with the free shuttle - it can take you to the local bus to go downtown. Friendly staff. I would recommend for travellers of all kinds. Has a great look and a great modern feel and is a good deal compared to other hotels in the area.	
Jul 16 2006	Very Nice	Really enjoyed our stay there. The rooms were very clean and the bathrooms were huge and very clean. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was also very good. The location is great for taking strolls down to the old harbor and to just hang out and having a beer at one of many outdoor cafes. Old Montreal is great and has many great places to eat. Pass on Schwartz deli very over rated! Try La Fonderia it was great.	
Oct 28 2005	Great ambiance service location.	We recently spent three nights at Auberge Bonaparte over the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend and very much enjoyed our stay. This smallish, boutique-style inn is conveniently located in the heart of Vieux Montreal, about a block from the rue St. Paul and just around the corner and a block south of the Basilique Notre-Dame, whose towers were visible from our rooms window. Our triple room was spacious, spotless and well-appointed, with one queen-sized and one double bed (decent, but perhaps not the most comfortable beds weve had in our travels), a high ceiling, floor-to-ceiling windows, some exposed brick, wood floors, and a large marble bathroom with jacuzzi and separate shower. Decor in the room and throughout the hotel was simple, fresh and tasteful. Our room, on the back side of the hotel, was very quiet. Service was very friendly and always helpful. Breakfast at the hotel each morning was a treat. It was all table-service, not buffet, and the choices included a variety of omlettes, french toast, crepes, breakfast sandwich, or an eggs/bacon/sausage/hash browns combo. All were delicious, and served with fruit salad or yogurt, plus fresh-squeezed orange juice, robust coffee, and a basket of fresh breads that included excellent, buttery croissants. A great way to fortify yourself for the day!We also had dinner one evening in the hotel's restaurant, Bonaparte, which didn't disappoint. The atmosphere was lovely and unpretentious, and the service was very good as well.This was our first visit to Montreal, and it won't be our last. Although the weather could have been better, we thoroughly enjoyed walking around the old town and other areas of the city. A few other highlights included the Pointe-a-Calliere archeological museum and the Parc du Mont Royal - a short cab ride up from the hotel with a lovely walk back down.	
Aug 21 2008 	Dishonest!	Unfortunately, we never actually had the chance to stay at this hotel... Why, you ask? Well, we received a $200 gift certificate to the hotel as a wedding present. When we finally found a weekend in which to use it (just over 1.5 years later, and after them granting us one &quot;extension&quot;)... we discovered the hotel would no longer accept it. They simply had a policy that certificates expire after 1 year (1.5 years if you beg).To think the hotel actually took $200 as payment for a service, and then placed an arbitrary deadline on redeeming this! Terrible! I wouldn't do business with such a business ever again!	
Jul 24 2007	Lovely Auberge Fair Location	We overnighted in Montreal at the Auberge Le Pomerol, 819 Boul. De Maisonneuve in July 2007. Our very clean, beautifully decorated and comfortable room had a king bed, large flat panel TV, and a Sony radio that was several grades above standard hotel issue. A large jetted-tub in the modest-size bathroom and remote for the AC capped off the feeling of small-space luxury. The inn provides some nice touches. Breakfast appears-- breads, cheese, juice, yogurt--in a closed basket hung on a hook outside your room. Cookies, dried fruits and other light snacks are available gratis in a downstairs room until 11 PM. We met only friendly and helpful staffers.We reserved the same day with the front desk at the very good price of $130 plus taxes using a &quot;last minute&quot; promo code obtained from Tourisme-Montreal . Free use of an off-site gym was included, but we declined. Parking is available in a private lot right behind the hotel at $14/night. For us the biggest, but not too bad, negative was the location. Although there are stores and restaurants close to the hotel, Old Montreal is not. It took these two seniors about 25 minutes to walk to Old Montreal, passing a scruffy panhandler along the way. Brisk walkers could cut that time in half. A desk clerk advised us not to walk too far towards the left out of the hotel because there is not too much good to see. Being native New Yorkers, we accept local &quot;good sense&quot; restrictions as part of life in any large city. A subway is very close, and taxis are always an option. A very minor inconvenience is the few steps down from the tiny lobby to the elevator. The staff willingly helps with your bags if you ask. My wife and I highly recommended this inn for leisure travelers, except for those who prefer to be closer to the old city. We very much enjoyed our brief stay.	
Apr 11 2008 	excellent hôtel		
Nov 4 2008 	okay- good location	hotel was in good location right in the main part of city .lobby was very weird and abit off putting - large weird statue in fountain ?? odd very odd !!room was fine nice and comfy and big enough just standard 3 star hotel room .. staff were not that friendly .. cheap good breakfast downstairs .. we got very cheap price i would not pay too much for this.. wasn't bad just try something else .. unless you get it very cheap ..	
Jun 12 2007 	Best value in the city	We stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and werent to impressed. We decided after shopping around to stay again because their price was good and the location is amazing. The hotel has since renovated and most lily gone through different managment becasue this place was soooo muich better this time. The new rooms are much nicer and well allocated and the bar and public areas are really well kept and presented. Their hotel bar is beautiful and the staff durin our whole trip was absolutly great and helpt us with a few problems which we had very well. WOULD DEFINETLY STAY AGAIN!. BEST LOCATION!!	
Mar 22 2007 	We recommend.		
Sep 13 2009 	A Nice Find. Wouldn't stay anywhere else.	My boyfriend and I stayed here over the Labor Day weekend, in the cheapest, smallest room available (we spent all our money on food) and were pleasantly surprised to see that the room size was more than adequate. Small bathroom, but everything was clean..except for a few stains on the comforter, but I'm not hugely fussy. The staff was very friendly and informative, plus all spoke good-to-proficient English. The parking situation was a dream, and the location, perfect. The Wi-Fi was a little spotty, but no big deal.We will definitely stay here next time and not take a gamble ever again-and believe me, Montreal has some hideous hotels hiding under the guise of a slick facade. Just stay here.	
Jun 19 2008 	Good location for getting around	This property is situated about 200 yards from Sherbrooke Metro (underground train) station, which means you can get anywhere in Montreal easily. Get a 3 day tourist pass for about £8. Rue St Denis is just around the corner, which offers plenty of restaurants and a great bar for beers, 3 Brasseurs, who brew their own beers. Get a pitcher for good value.The room was a decent size overlooking the car park at the rear so not a very good view but that didn't bother us. The room was definitely tired. The carpet was grubby and due for replacement. The areas that should be sealed in the bathroom had tile grout instead and this had all cracked with some being non-existent. The whole bedroom could do with refreshing but the bed was comfortable. The air-conditioning was effective but too noisy to leave on at bedtime.English TV channels were limited but then the room is just a base really.Although this is a non-smoking hotel on a couple of occasions we noticed the smell of cigarettes in the hallway whilst going up to our room. And worse still the unmistakable smell of cannabis also on a couple of occasions. Thankfully we couldn't smell anything when we entered our room as the doors are solid, also preventing hallway noise from being heard whilst inside.Breakfast is included but will only keep you going for a couple of hours as it comprised of items such as muffins, 3 miniature crossants or chocolate au pain. You get to choose just one though but you can also get a piece of fruit as well. That said the muffins were very tasty, particularly the blueberry and maple ones. They microwave the muffins so I asked for one cold. It was cold alright as it must have come straight out of the fridge, hence the microwaving.The staff were friendly and helpful and were happy to speak english.Unless I knew that I was getting a renovated room I wouldn't use this hotel again but can higlhy recommend its location.	
Dec 4 2005 	Boutique Hotel - Four Visits - Definitely Above Average	I have now stayed here 4 times over the past year - 4 different rooms: 1 excellent; 2 fine and 1 OK (a little tired with thin walls - located at the back of the building, but still very OK).Hotel location is great; staff is friendly and helpful; decor is fine; rooms are very clean; TV and in room CD/radio work. Latest room was very quiet. The continental breakfast is included in the rate; subtantial with choices &amp; definitely above average for a continental breakfast.My only beefs: I couldn't turn the heating down - so, room was a little on the warm side (hey it's December and snowing outside); the tea at breakfast left a lot to be desired - minimal in the big scheme of things (I don't drink coffee), but the bread containing orange peel was just excellent. The toilet wasn't flushing properly, but was promptly fixed the next day with no hassle.I have stayed in quite a few hotels on business and this one definitely rates a consistent above average (so far). This hotel is definitely a &quot;hidden gem&quot;; and I almost never give full marks on principle.	
Feb 16 2003	Nice but hot (even in the dead of winter)!		
Jul 9 2008 	Very Nice Affordable Brand New	Stayed at the Montreal Montreal Airport for one night. The room was very clean with brand new furniture (hotel is brand new). The front desk agent was very friendly and our check-in was very fast. Very nice pool with salt water. Nice tub as well. Would defenetly recommend it and I will stay there again if going to Montreal.	
Sep 11 2007 	Good price	We recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for a weekend. There was a half price deal with hotels.com which made it worthwhile. Rooms very clean and reasonably large. Friendly and helpful staff. Full buffet breakfast was very nice and had a good selection of hot and cold items. Walking distance to old montreal as well as downtown shopping. I would def stay there again with the same deal...not entirely sure if I woul have been as happy had we paid full price for the room! In room movies cost about $13 plus tax. They offer in room free wireless but the coverage was pretty poor - we only got 1 bar out of 5. Eventually managed to connect but took a while.	
Oct 9 2009 	nice place	The hotel was nice and the room are nice and are nice view from top of the hotel. Great location in the center of the town. Many shops and restaurants are around within walking distance.	
May 15 2007 	Wonderful hotel highly recommended !	Me and my husband, went for the weekend in Montreal and we had a wonderful experience at the Delta Centre-Ville. The location is perfect if you want to walk around in Old Montreal and Downtown. The room was super confortable and we had a stunning view of the city. We ate at the rotating restaurant and it was very good, the employee were so nice and the food fabulous. The view of the city was breathtaking, so romantic ! We will come back with the kids for sure. The pool, spa and fitness club were perfect as well. Overall, the best experience we had in Montreal so far !	
Apr 28 2004	Very Nice but not out of this world		
Jul 19 2009 	Great hotel	Stayed 1 night in this hotel and found staff, rooms and everything to our liking. A big shout out to the staff and management. We had planned a 2 night stay but for reasons unrelated to the hotel, we decided to cut the stay short. Hotel management willingly canceled the 2nd night and honored the free parking rate even though it was a 2 night stay rate. My gold Hilton Honors probably had something to do with this. We remained parked in the garage all day while we walked around vieux Montreal. But, they went one step further. I had a lot of Canadian $$ that I was not going to spend with our shortened visit so they refunded my credit card for the first night (which I had paid in deposit 2 weeks earlier) and allowed me to pay for the room in cash so I didn't have as much $$ to exchange back. They were friendly the entire time I was pestering them with these requests. Our room was very clean and most importantly, quiet. If there is a negative, it is that the morning breakfast room is packed. We went down late thinking we'd miss the rush but instead, I think everybody had our idea. We had to wait in line about 15 minutes and had to eat sitting in the lobby area on couches instead of tables. Was not the end of the world but it might be worth it to go down to eat earlier in the morning.	
Apr 15 2009 	Clean Rooms Spacious Great Location.	Overall we loved the hotel and will stay there again next time we visit Montreal. Our only complaint was that our room faced a construction site that got active at 6:45am!!! Not the hotel's fault, but a nuisance just the same. See attached pics for our &quot;view.&quot; We booked the &quot;Studio&quot; room and it was plenty spacious for the 2 of us. Clean and comfortable, which is most important to us. Hotel is located right across the street from the Place Des Armes metro stop. Biggest plus about this hotel is the breakfast. Cooked to order eggs, pancakes, omelets. Plus a wide variety of cereals and breads. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Look no further, this is where you should stay!	
Aug 26 2009 	Tammy was the BEST	Visited Montreal for our 42nd Anniversay last weekend. First time back to thyis beautiful city since our honeymoon exactly 42 years ago.The Queen is perfectly located and does many things well and nothing badly.Our stay on the Gold floor was made especially enjoyable by Tammy. She made our visits to the lounge area especially enjoyable. (I'm not certain of her title - she attended to the snack and drink area - but, went way beyond expected in service and warmth. We especially appreciated her suggestion of Restaurant Julien as a small (not-such-an-elaborate-deal) within walking distance. (For some reason,?? the Gold Room desk on the Saturday evening shift did NOT offer Menus &lt;or much help really&gt; about near by (walkable) alternatives to the Fairmont's Beaver Club).A comment on value: maybe things have changed in the last couple years - I think a beer or glass of wine OUGHT to be complimentary on any premium floor. There was an Honor Bar charge.:( They had a GREAT selection of beers. Wines were nice but limited selection available. The snacks were fine but certainly not remarkable. (We've really enjoyed and been spoiled by the Ritz-Carlton Club Floor in past years.)All things considered, there was nothing that would disuade me from staying here again (Tammy might convince us to return) but, I'd probably shop-around to see if there might be something that &quot;had it all&quot;.	
Aug 23 2004	Well located helpful hotel	I stayed Thursday 19 to Sunday 22 August 2004. The hotel has a wide drive in from Gauchetiere (street) and splendid entrance leading immediately to lifts to the top two floors of the skyscraper. Reaching the hotel from the bus terminal or train station (both serve Dorval Airport) is easy as the hotel is linked to Montreal's extensive underground walkway system. My HH Honors card gave me an upgrade so my room 1338 may have been better than average. It had a huge bed, desk, armchairs and was generally well equipped. Bathroom was on the small size, as the door opening inwards almost touched the WC. Everything was spotless for my arrival and during my stay. Reception staff were friendly and helpful with answering several questions. There is an outdoor heated pool about 15 metres long open from 06.30 every morning. Business Centre closed at weekends: nearest internet access is coin machines in railway station or at Chapters Bookshop. I had one dinner in hotel. A restaurant is closed for refurbishment. The kitchens were under pressure due to a wedding reception and though the service was again friendly, I would rate the food as average only. Overall I would certainly stay again for the hotel's location, friendliness and outdoor pool.	
Aug 8 2004	Excellent suites great value	I spent three nights here recently and I think the rooms are exceptional value for the price paid. The suites have a seperate bedroom from the kitchen/family rooms. The kitchen is spacious and functional - you could stay here on business for weeks and it would serve you well.The rooms are very comfortable, there's two tv's, my room had a sunny balcony, and there's a desk to work at. Free continental breakfast is a nice touch, although it does get very busy down there and the selection is generally yogurt / muffins, with a toast machine (so get in quick!) Front desk was friendly. Would definitely stay again for the price (around $US90).	
Aug 14 2008 	Good Location -but you can find a better hotel	Stayed for 4 nights in July to celebrate our anniversary. Booked a contemporary king with balcony....just like the picture (supposedly) on hotels.com. What we got was a run of the mill room. Actually had a king sized bed with a &quot;queen&quot; sized headboard....and definitely not contemporary or updated as the pictures show.. The bathroom was good sized with a separate shower....the shower had a very inexpensive plastic showerhead and was fairly small. (also had a tub faucet about 8&quot; off the floor of shower...for whatever reason.The hotel needs to be updated....shows it's age from the 70's. The lobby is dated as well with velvet sofas heavy woods. The lounge on the 20th floor does a lot of business creating a long wait for the elevators on friday and saturday nights. The pool was supposedly on the same floor...went up twice but never found it....no one around to ask. Had cable TV but most were in french and picture quality wasn't very good. Had a trouser press and shoe shine machine in room which was nice. Ice had to be &quot;bought&quot; from the concierge at $2 a bucket plus a tip of course, not available to get yourself. Parking a little high at $15 a day...overall not bad....but not a 3 1/2 star hotel. By the way, tried to write a review at hotels.com.....they didn't put it online or respond...apparently they have a different agenda than tripadvisor.	
Jan 2 2007	NASTY!! Avoid the nightmare!!!	My experience with Hotel De Paris was so bad that I went out of my way to create a tripadvisor account and write this review! I also want to agree with another comment regarding the assumption that the good reviews were written by the hotel staff/owner. If you look at their accounts, you will see that those accounts were used only once to write those reviews. I found this hotel on hotwire.com. Since I usually have good luck with hotwire, I booked Hotel De Paris for 3 nights over New Years weekend. The hotel was rated 3 stars (comparable to a Doubletree), so I paid $100 a night. Hotel De Paris is the worst hotel I ever stayed at!!! The hotel is really dirty and smells. The room was tiny. The carpet was dirty and didnt look like it was vacuumed for a very long time. The sheets and comforter were disgusting and didnt look like theyve been washed. The walls were extremely thin (you can hear everything). The bathroom had stains and was gross. The hotel should be rated 1 star or a low scale hostel. I tried to upgrade/switch room, but the other rooms were worse. FYI, I checked out their web site and the rooms are nowhere close to the pictures. Also, I woke up after the third night (this morning) with bed bug bites on my arms and legs. I have already written an email to hotwire telling them that I will never use their service again. Please do yourself a favor and never stay at this hotel! Our friends got into the Hyatt (priceline) for the same price we paid!	
Apr 28 2008 	Thoroughly Enjoable Stay	To celebrate my wife's birthday, we decided to plan a weekend trip to Montreal, and booked our stay at the Hotel du Fort.This was our first stay at this particular hotel and we were most happy with our choice. The staff from the Front Desk person to the housekeepers we met each morning in the hallways, were always quick with a warm smile and a hello, and made us feel very welcomed. Our room, while not the largest we've stayed in was clean, modern, and well equipped.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel du Fort and would not hesitate to recommend this particular inn to other travellers.	
Aug 1 2003	Very enjoyable stay.		
Oct 2 2008 	Schönes neugebautes Hotel aus dem Jahr 2007 der Vino-Hotelier-Famile		
Sep 23 2006 	fantastic hotel	i am just returning from a two day business trip in Canada and can not say enough about this hotel. The rooms are excellent-mine had a roof top terrace and a heated bath room floor. The furnishing strickly Knoll and the bed was the best. The location is central and the design superb. The food was ok and the drink pours are small but the staff incredible. Ther are only 30 rooms so everyone is treated like a true guest.I can not wait to return	
Oct 8 2009 	disappointed	Beautiful hotel from the outside and the lobby was superb. Here were my problems:two computers for guests' use, no time assigned so hard to get on to, then they were continuously out of order. Had to pay in advance for the room because the front desk clerk was new and made a mistake. Room was tiny... photos were misleading, 6'1&quot; partner and his feet were off the end of the bed. Finally, had a drink of cranberry from the mini bar late at night and threw up! Turned out some of the mini bar was well out of date. On a positive note, the food in the restaurant was excellent and the staff spoke very good english.	
Aug 30 2009 	Sweet Suites	We visit Montreal at least once a year dividing our stays between the city center and Old Montreal. We have tried five other hotels and chose this one based on reviews at this site and the desire to try yet another Montreal hotel. Overall we were pleased with our choice.Most of the rooms at this boutique hotel are suites. Our choice was a deluxe suite which has a layout with the bedroom located in the middle of the suite without direct access to a window. There is a glass see though panel that opens to the living area. The living room/dining area had two floor to ceiling windows that more then make up for the lack of an outside window in the bedroom. There was also a kitchenette area, and for once, more then enough storage space in the room and bathroom. The look of the suite is contemporary with a slight minimalist feel to it. The bathroom was very spacious and nice, but a little on the boring side for such an ample area.The only other area of the hotel that we used was the swimming pool which was very nice. It is located on the fourteenth floor with walls of glass on two sides. There is also an outside terrace with lounge chairs and a hot tub. Small changing rooms are nearby with showers, as is a sauna. The gym area was nice with big windows, but it did not have enough equipment for a complete workout. The spa is also located on this level but we did not investigate. We tried to have a drink in the hotel at 11:15pm on Saturday night and learned that this was not possible. This was very surprising and disappointing that a nice hotel this size could not provide this basic service.We also could not help but notice that the service at this hotel was not very friendly. We normally do not complain about service or even have service problems, but almost every employee we encountered was just barely friendly. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this property, especially the spacious room and nice pool. If those features are important to you then this hotel is a good choice for you. It is also right across the street from the Bell Centre if you happen to be attending an event there.	
Aug 14 2007 	A Shining Example	We visited the Nelligan in early August and as soon as we walked in, it felt as though this we would be a most agreeable hotel in the heart of old Montreal.Initially guests are welcomed by the guys at the front door then you are greeted once again at the checkin desk for your room allocation, all of which takes a matter of minutes .The rooms are superb with very large comfy beds, spacious bathroom, multi channel tv, cd player and writing desk.The lighting is very tasteful and adds to the real home from home feel.Continental breakfast consists of cereals, fruit ,pastries, tea and coffee etc.From 5 to 7pm in the hotel is cocktail time where guests receive a free glass of wine with a complimentary cheese selection.Should you wish to dine at the hotel, there is the Verses restaurant which is a bit pricey but good.There is also the roof terrace cafe which serves more snacky food but is an ideal spot on a summer,s evening.The staff are most helpful and are very knowledgable when it comes to restaurant recommendations, tours etc.After a few visits to the front desk they soon know your name.All in all, this is great example of a fine boutique hotel from which other establishments could certainly learn a few tricks.Should we return to Montreal this would be our first choice.	
Sep 19 2005	C'est parfait	Truly world class. Outstanding staff, fabulous building. Bedroom was a decent size and nicely kitted out. Breakfast was really good and the bar was always busy with a good atmosphere - sitting in the window was good for people watching. Good restaurant but slightly pretenious and service not quite as perfect as the hotel. Great roof terrace bar.Super location. Vieux Montreal is the place to stay and the Nelligan is right at the heart of things. Navaje (?) has live music while you dine and the food was pretty good. Restaurant du Vieux Port (same group as the Hotel) was good food and good service. La Maree on the main square was so bad we got up and left. Jardin Nelson does a good value lunch - long queues for the garden yet the terrace was great for watching the world go by.	
Jan 3 2005	Enjoyed our time at the Hotel Nelligan	My boyfriend and I just returned from our trip from Montreal. We were having a difficult time deciding between staying at the Auberge du Vieux Port and the Hotel Nelligan (both in the same hotel group and both in Old Montreal.) We decided on Auberge, but once we arrived in Montreal and checked out both hotels, we thought the Hotel Nelligan was much more our style (more upscale and modern boutique hotel) so we switched hotels. (The Auberge is nice, but much more rustic and not as &quot;warm&quot; feeling). The staff at both hotels were very accomadating and helped us with the switch. Our stay at the Nelligan was wonderful and we hope to visit it again. Our only complaints were that the free continental breakfast wasn't too good - stale croissants (although hard to complain when its free) and the room had a smell of smoke two days in a row. Not consistently, but enough to be annoying for non-smokers. It is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, but they don't seem to enforce this policy.We highly recommend staying in Old Montreal. It is very quaint and has a feel of &quot;Old Europe&quot;. Nice restaurants, upscale galleries...Downtown Monteal felt more like any other big metropolis. Fun to visit, but not great to stay in.	
Jun 24 2009 	Great spot nice hotel and not so informed concierge!	The hotel was a great find! As with some other people who reviewed the hotel, I got 2 rooms through priceline for my partner and my parents. Also signed up for the Select benefits and that was well worth it. Unfortunately, I developed an acute medical condition while at the hotel and the staff were very quick to get a doctor to my side to tend to it at 1am. On the flip side, the one thing that marred my stay at the hotel was the concierge. She was pretty good with most questions but on two occasions, she failed simple questions. 1. She informed us that it would be cheaper for the 4 of us to get a 10-ride card on the metro as we could share the card. WRONG. The card is per person and it costs $3.50 for the card and you top it up after that. Useless for a weekend trip.2. I asked about parking at Jean Talon Marche. She said that it may be difficult to park as there was only street parking and that there was no lot. So the 4 of us took a subway there (very easy) but after purchasing tons of stuff, had to try to take a taxi to haul the items back. Would have been better if we could have driven there....why? Because there is a very BIG PARKING LOT attached to the market where parking was $1.50 for 90 mins. Instead, we had to call a taxi after waiting for 30 mins and pay $15. Last thing I needed as I was recovering from my medication condition. (Trying to make the most of my weekend in Montreal) Pros:- great location, close to metro station and easily walkable to museums, etc.- comfortable roomsCons: - outdated furniture and furnishings- very expensive valet parking ($26)- uninformed concierge	
Nov 21 2007	Really good trip Nice staff	I was in Montreal last week-end and the trip was excellent. The room was clean and calm. The staff was professional and they were going out of their way to help us with finding restaurants and attractions. Yes, the hotel is located downtown with all the starnge people on the street but as soon as we pass the doors of the hotel... Everything is peaceful and confortable.For sure i will be back in this hotel.	
Mar 26 2006 	Friendly clean hotel with wonderful stafrf	Staff were particularly helpful, rooms were simple but very clean. There's a delighful restaurant next door. The continental breakfast included was minimal, but full menu was available.	
Sep 11 2006	Slipshod Service	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Xixe recently with our baby. In general I'd give this Hotel a fair rating for very good room size, excellent cleanliness, and excellent location. What I would give this Hotel a FAILING grade for is service. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we received essentially no help whatsoever. This began with the failure of the staff to set up a crib for our infant--while this generally isn't a big deal, if you are arriving with a crying baby at midnight, it most certainly is! The staff took a leisurely 30 minutes to bring a crib. The second absolute failure of the staff was there complete lack of knowledge of the neighborhood. After staying there for 4 days I thought I knew the neighborhood restaurants better than they did. The third example of poor service was the failure of the attendants to provide any help with bringing baggage or our stroller up and down the stairs. On numerous occasions they would just watch us, as we struggled with bags and the baby. The only help we received was from another guest! Finally, at these prices per night WiFI internet service should be complimentary, which it isn't.This is a very clean hotel, with large rooms in an excellent location. Given the level of service it really feels like an overpriced rooming house, not a 4 star hotel.	
Sep 9 2005	Not as charming as I expected	This hotel is in the beautiful old part of Montreal. The room was large and clean however I felt as did another reviewer that the hotel lacked atmosphere. Also there was no free wi fi in the rooms as in most other hotels in canada or free local calls for that matter, no mini bar, no tea and coffee making factlities although the concierge did bring us complimentary coffee when I asked about this. We found the room very noisey and would recommend you do not overlook the street although interior banging doors are also real problem. The hotel was well priced but i do not think I would return, I think we had been spoiled by paying less for a lot more in Toronto.	
Apr 25 2009 	I enjoyed my stay.	This hotel was fairly standard as others have said. I thought the service in the restaurant was great (and decent food, tapas style and bar style), the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful in orienting us to the city, and the location is very convenient. Temperature control is an issue (no thermostats) and the gym is excruciatingly hot. High speed interent is pricey. Overall I would recommend this hotel.	
Jul 30 2009 	Excellent hôtel		
Aug 16 2009 	Renovations are Done	Many of the recent reviews of this hotel noted the ongoing renovations. Those now seem to be done and the hotel seems to be put back together.We were given an upgrade a check in and found the room we were given to be spacious and nicely appointed.My wife and I found the hotel to be very luxourious and in an excellent location to explore either the shopping district or the old port area of Montreal.My beef however is with the parking arrangements for the hotel. Firstly, hotel guests can only park on level 9 and lower so getting in and out of the garage is time consuming. Next getting from the parking to the hotel requires an evelator change and a bit of a walk to the front desk. If all that was not probelm enough, the hotel has no arrangement with the garage to allow for in and out priviledges. This means that trips to dinner etc. rack up significant parking charges.All in all its a very nice hotel but with a poor parking setup.	
Sep 1 2007	Etablissement de très bon standing au coeur de la ville		
Mar 3 2008 	Meh	This motel seemed a little on the worse for wear side. The key cards didn't work in the lock so we had to run back to the front desk. The room was small and the beds were meh. There was a mini fridge and a microwave but the chairs for the table were really uncomfortable.The location is right off the highway, which is good if you're coming from a far distance. (we were driving from Charlottetown) If you are staying more than 1 day in Montreal and/or don't have a vehicle you will need to stay somewhere much closer to downtown.Parking is weird as well. You have to park in front of your room and since there was a huge pile of snow we had to park on an angle, in front of icy snow. This made getting luggage in and out a little tricky.I didn't go for breakfast, but my travel mates did and said there was only cereal and toast.It was an ok place to crash for one night but I wouldn't stay there a whole week.	
Jul 17 2008 	Good Experience	Before leaving Toronto, I went online to read the reviews for this hotel and I was shocked and terrified of the amount of horror stories that people had experienced at this hotel. My boyfriend and I decided that we would wait until we got to the room and inspect it then make our decision whether we stayed for the weekend or not. We arrived late on July 11, 2008 checked into our room and discovered that they had given us a room with two twin beds when we reserved a smoking room with a queen bed. We went back to reception and they were very nice and switched our rooms immediately. We got our room on the 15th floor and immediately inspected the room for &quot;bed bugs&quot; or for any sign of bugs. The room was clean, kitchen was clean and no sign of bugs. Yes, I will agree the hotel is in need of major update. And definitely the hotel needs to address there &quot;bed bug&quot; issue, however our experience was fine. We enjoyed the convenience of the hotel being close to the Old Port. My boyfriend and I love to cook, therefore having a stove was nice when we got up in the morning. There is an IGA down the street about 2blocks. And downtown Montreal is in walking distance. I took pictures of the hotel for those rude people out there to prove that I am not lying. This is not the greatest hotel in the world, but honestly people YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. If you wanted a 5 star hotel spend the money. If you are on a budget and enjoy being close to everything go to this place. If the room is not up to your &quot;standards&quot; than cancel your reservation get your money back and go to a different hotel.	
Jun 30 2009 	Good deal nice rooms central for walking.	My husband and I rented a room in this hotel for a semi-romantic weekend getaway. Le 1 Rene Levesque was very clean, with nice, modern decor. The price was under $90 per night, and we &quot;splurged&quot; for the C suite. I would say it is probably worth it for the space. The room was clean and the linens and furniture were modern and new looking. The view out of our 11th floor room was very nice and the shades worked well at night. The AC was very adjustable and the room was nice and cool. All of the front desk gentlemen were friendly and helpful. There were no problems with our reservation or room. The location was central to so much. We walked to where the jazz fest was setting up, up St. Laurent to the nice restaurant strip, to Old Montreal and to the shopping area of St. Catharine. None of those took much more than 10 minutes each way. We even used the internet for free to look up things to do in the area, but brought our own ethernet cord because of another reviewers response. Here are the few and minor cons to this hotel: 1. Parking- there is no hotel parking. We parked our car at a meter right behind the hotel. It wasn't cheap, but it wasn't any more expensive than a garage. The next day, we moved our car one block over for free parking. There are lots nearby, but we're young and cheap and able to walk a few blocks. 2. Bathroom accessories: water pressure for a shower was pretty low. I mean, it was adequate, but it left something to be desired. The towels/washcloth/etc must've been the cheapest available. If you like nice, big towels, you might bring your own. The bath mat was paper, and there was no maid sent to clean our room... which we didn't mind because we only stayed 2 nights... but therefore we didn't get clean towels the next day. 3. Kitchenette- 2 place settings but no pans or cooking utensils. Originally the plan was to eat eggs for breakfast in the room to save money. We did use the little fridge to keep our coffee cream cool. 4. Location- though it was central and we felt comfortable walking the area, there is a sketchy little park right next door where there was some very obvious homelessness and drug activity. There was also some sex related shops that families might be uncomfortable walking by (not that you could see anything from the street..) The area was well patrolled by law enforcement and we never felt unsafe, even in the evening. If you are a solo traveler, you might feel more uneasy. There were other very small minor things that a 5 star hotel wouldn't have overlooked, such as: the TV was very far away from the bed, no headboard or footboard (I guess you could say it was the modern decor?) which made reading in bed more challenging, no people to carry your suitcase to your room, etc... though none of those things impacted our trip. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and thought it was a good value for the money.	
Apr 29 2005	Good not great	It really should be 3.5 stars but I'll give them 4. I got a decent rate on a &quot;jacuzzi suite&quot;. First, the jacuzzi is just a couple of jets in the bathtub but it fills quickly and with very hot water. Bathroom is not big but nice with marble everywhere. Suite just means a larger room with a small sitting area on one end, I've been in larger &quot;non-suites&quot;. I guess it's the whole European boutique thing where smaller is better, that's seems to be the whole feel throughout the hotel. The lobby is small, the gym is small, the elevators are small, etc. If you are claustrophobic, look elsewhere. I also stayed in a regular room over New Years, same deal but not as nice in the service dept. The staff is friendly and helpful for the most part. Location is good, just far enough away to be quiet but not too far to walk to everything (unless it's 35F and raining, then it seems like it's miles away!). Bottom line, if you get a great rate, stay here, if you can find something cheaper, stay there!	
Oct 7 2009 	Clean and Comfortable Pretty Good Location	The room is small, but it's very clean and cozy. the whole environment is so quiet and comfortable, with free breakfast of huge, the room charge is very reasonable. Especially, the location, we can get to St-catherina street which is main shopping and resto street in montreal just in 3 minutes on foot. And the staff is so friendly, good experience!!!	
Aug 2 2004	Lovely Hotel in Vieux Montreal!	A wonderful boutique hotel in Vieux Montreal - very charming, clean, nicely decorated, large rooms, lovely garden restaurant. Definitely THE place to stay in Montreal.	
Dec 19 2003	would return	great place, terrific customer service- by the way my girlfriend felt hotel is very romantic- we had room with fireplace- also we both enjoyed the continental breakfast! when you arrive you also get coupons for a free cocktail or glass of wine from bar! restaurant is nice, rooms attractive and clean, very attentive service, great location- lots of very good places to eat within walking distance. all in all highly recommended. looking forward to going back!	
Aug 20 2007	une belle adresse mais un peu surfaite		
May 18 2009 	Excellent location excellent room excellent staff!	We stayed at the Le Square Phillips over the long weekend, May 15-18, 2009 on the recommendation of other Trip Advisor members and had a great experience overall.The location of the hotel is perfect. It is right in the middle of downtown, less than a block south of St. Catherines Sreet and all the shopping it offers. It is also only a 15-minutes walk to Old Montreal, which is where we like to be when in Monteal.The hotel itself is modest. A small reception area, a small sitting area, no bar. However, considering the location there are plenty of bars and restaurants in teh area so I guess you don't really need that inside the hotel.The room that we booked was a studio king. The room was big, with a sitting area and a kitchenette. The bathroom was relatively small and the bath tub not very functional, but the rest of the room made up for that. The hotel towels were nice and soft and the robe comfy. The kitchen was fully stocked in case you wanted to use it (which we didn't). The room had free internet which was great since I had to get some work done over the weekend. The hotel advertises that breakfast is included. Based on our previous experience, we assumed that since the website did not advertise that the breakfast was continental breakfast, that it would be a full buffet breakfast. However, the breakfast was continental breakfast and a little disappointing if you are not a carbs fan (which I am, but my husband is not). Breakfast included montreal bagels, bread, muffins, fruit, cereal, juice and coffee. We had breakfast at the hotel the first morning but went out for breakfast the next 2 mornings. The service at the hotel is magnificent. We asked for recommendations for restaurants for dinner on two occassions, and both times the reception staff sent out to fabulous restaurants that we very much enjoyed. The staff responded to every request quickly (ie more towels, which were sent up in less than 5 minutes) and over all were very keen on good customer service. We recommend this hotel to anyone who is staying in Monteal and wants a central location, good customer service, and doesn't care about hotel amenities (ie bar, breakfast, etc).	
Aug 16 2007 	Great Choice!	We spent 4 nights there and everything was as expected. We had a Junior double suite - double bed in an alcove, living room with pull out sofa, and kitchenette. The room was huge and gave room for a family of four to spread out. We made a number of requests (extra pillows, silence the barking dog next door) and all were taken care of promptly and with a smile.The continental breakfast was just ok - cereal, croissants, toast, juice, coffee. (I was hoping for chocolate croissants!) It was busy and they were well staffed to clear dishes and replenish supplies.The pool and exercise area were small but clean and well outfitted, and there is a nice sun deck with lounge chairs on the roof.The location is ok, near University of McGill, and convenient to the Metro, shopping, and major portions of the underground city. But it was a good 15-20 minute walk to Old Montreal (at a fast pace), and there was not a great selection of better resaurants nearby.It was a good location for a family - McDonalds, Burger King, Quiznos, and food courts are very close, as is an IMAX movie theatre. For a romantic getaway, I think there are better choices location-wise.	
Aug 3 2009 	There is nothing wrong with this hotel	after reading some of the reviews of this hotel, i was a bit hesitant to stay there. just goes to prove that you can't satisfy everyone. there is nothing wrong with this hotel! we have travelled quite a bit and like to stay in the nicest place we can afford. at $129 through travelzoo, this hotel was well worth the money. we had a wonderful view from our 31st floor room, comfy king size bed, and had no problem with any noise. we did not try the restaurant, but although a bit pricey for our budget, the menu looked fantastic. i have no idea why anyone would say the lobby looked &quot;tired&quot;?? it was immaculate, staff very friendly and helpful also. we would not hesitate to stay there again as long as we got another great deal like we did. another major plus: the metro runs directly under this hotel, making getting around super easy. especially nice on rainy days.	
Oct 4 2008 	NIce Hotel	I just returned from spending 2 nights at the Marriott Chateau Marriott. For the most part my husband and I really enjoyed the hotel. We really loved the location. A 3 minute walk from the train station, a 5 minute walk to shopping and restaurants and easy to see being 32 stories tall. The concierge was great in setting dinner reservations and city tour. The restaurant was good, but extremely expensive. I was shocked to see my bill. The room was comfortable. The bed was great, the bathroom small and the tv outdated, but had a good picture. I would stay here again.	
Sep 22 2006 	Positive experience over Labor Day weekend	My husband and I went to Montreal for three nights to celebrate our anniversary and we were pleased with the hotel. The location is truly fantastic -- many of the places we visited were within walking distance and the metro is under the hotel and easy to access. The area felt very safe to us and we were out each night. The staff was polite and helpful. We received a couple of gifts and they were delivered and situated in our room in our absence. I did find that the front desk was a bit understaffed as we had to wait a little too long to check in. As for our room, I agree that the views are excellent. Request a room overlooking Dorchester Square and you'll have a great view of the city! Our bathroom was nice and clean. I found that the rest of the amenities in the room were average and what I expected from a Marriott - clean and satisfactory.	
May 24 2005	Not a suitable hotel for families travelling with children	We stayed there with our 3 children. The rooms are not suitable for more than 4 people as they are very small and crowded with large furniture. The placement of a crib for our 1 year old made things worse as it blocked the exit from the room and the entrance to the bathroom, everytime we needed to move the crib had to come with us. It was very uncomfortable and made it impossible for us to have a decent night sleep. Another non-child friendly issue was that the shallow area of the pool is 1.5 meters (4.9') deep basically for children that can swim only, there was a hot tub but no one under the age of 10 was allowed to use it. It is unfortunate that the reservation staff (made directly with the hotel) did not notify us of these issues upfront. Supposedly there are suites available in the hotel, which we asked to be upgraded too when we saw our room (we would have been happy to pay difference and this was made clear to the management) but as per the front desk, nothing was available. They provided us with free breakfast for the two days instead. I would recommend this hotel to those travelling on business or as couples only.	
Apr 8 2009 	Was very nice for the night we were there	This hotel is a $35 set rate cab fare from the airport. Free internet in the lobby. A 15 minute walk into the centre of town.	
Aug 5 2009 	Bachelor Party	everything was prepared very nicely for a group of 11. Turgay was the most accommodating hotel manager i have ever come across. very close to many sites and nightlife. overall, we couldn't ask for more.	
Apr 29 2009 	A true gem in the heart of Montreal that will ensure your stay is superb!	My entire experience with the Parc Suites Hotel was exceptional. The owner and staff were very friendly and helpful right from the time of the reservation phone call. Our stay began with our arrival in the personally attended and secure parking lot with a friendly face offering us a helpful hand with our luggage up to the elegant and quaint lobby of the Parc Suites. The hospitality continued with a welcoming tour and offer of suites, all of which were very reasonable priced. Not only was the experience with the owner and staff pleasant, but the comfortable cleanliness of the newly renovated and decorated suites ensured our happiness during our stay. Not only will we stay there on future visits to Montreal, but I would very highly recommend this centrally located gem of a hotel to any traveller to Montreal!	
Oct 19 2009 	oufff jamais pu		
Jan 12 2009 	DO NOT BOOK HERE!! Horrible experience will never return	The main reason we chose this particular hotel is we wanted to get the most bang for our buck. BIG BIG mistake. We arrived at the hotel around 3:30 pm on a Monday and went to check in. Was notified at that time, although guaranteed parking at the hotel, that we would be parking a block away in the public underground parking in the library for 10$ a day.Once we brought all our luggage into our room, which smelled of musky, stale smoke (we had to spray perfume, open a window and turn on a fan in order to get rid of the smell), we went to park our car and walked back to the hotel. As we were walking to our room, the front desk clerk (and owner, which we later found out) rudely informed us that we should respect the other patrons of the hotel and not be loud or we'd be kicked out. We found it extremely disrespectful considering the only reason he said this was because we were three young girls (20-22).We got to our hotel room to find that we only had 2 towels so we went down to ask for one extra as there were three of us, and he reluctantly gave us an extra towel. Every time we would leave the hotel, whether it was early in the morning for sightseeing and shopping, or later at night for dinner and dancing, the front desk would always ask us which room we were staying in, which we found to be a little odd. We didnt think much of it.On our third day at the hotel (new years eve), we arrived at the hotel after sightseeing to the police at the hotel. We later found out that over 1000$ worth of items and money had been stolen from a room on the same floor as us. The hotel does not provide safes and does not use swipe cards for their rooms. We are provided with one key and the extras are all with the hotel staff. The owners denied having any involvement in the robbery, and refused to let the police search the housekeeping or owners vehicles or property for the stolen items... a little fishy in my opinion.The hotel staff, aside from one individual who worked the overnight shifts, are crooked and give horrible customer service. Not once did we feel welcome. We will never be back to this hotel and I hope you will chose another place to stay during your visit as well. Their staff are not trustworthy and completely ruined the one groups (who's property was stolen) new years and trip, along with ours.The fact that they asked what room we were in when we LEFT our rooms, random phone calls/hang ups late morning and early evening to see if we were in our rooms, etc... it all added up. DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL WHEN IN MONTREAL!! It may seem like a good deal at the time, however, I'd STRONGLY advise against it. Whether this incident was a one time occurance, I would hate to see this happen again to another group of travellers.	
Sep 30 2008	Nice modern hote excellent rooms not the best location	This is a modern hotel, with good facilities- swiming pool, quality restuarant, and bar. Restaurant has above average price, service not great, but set meal worth trying. The rooms are above average size, clean and comfortable. The only let down is the location, it is a few subway stops out of the centre. We were with a tour group and got back from sight seeing very late most nights, which meant we either had to eat in the restuarant or get on the subway to find food, as there is only fast food available nearby. But if location is not an issue for you, then I would recommend this for the price.	
Aug 29 2009	wonderful hotel	We had a perfect stay at this hotel and I can't find anything negative to tell.Rooms were spacoius and the rainforest shower a dream.Staff was friendly and it was everything you would expect from a sofitel and 5 star hotel.	
Oct 18 2007	Nice hotel but avoid the restaurant	Stayed for 3 nights Oct 11 to 14 2007. Family of 4 with 2 teenage daughters. We had the quad room with 2 double beds. Usually, in other hotels, the quad rooms have 2 queen beds. These beds were small and tilted outwards. Had to be careful not to roll off. The size of the room was large which is why I can't understand the small beds. All the staff was extremely polite with the exception of the staff in the dining room. On our first morning in the restaurant I had to ask for coffee 3 times. I asked the waitress if I could have something a little different than what was on the menu, such as a grilled sandwich or something less heavy than what they offered, but she said they were too busy and the chef would say no as he was preparing to switch over to the lunch menu. There were only 3 tables with diners, so I couldn't figure out the &quot;busy&quot; comment. Also there must have been 20 staff members walking around acting as if they were &quot;working&quot;. Finally I ordered a $12 soup which was average.Needless to say, we never set foot in there again during our stay!!This also happened to other family members who were traveling with us but on a different occassion. They had to ask for coffee 4 times!! Won't stay there again, many other hotels near by.	
Sep 1 2008 	Bel établissement conforme à ce que l'on attend d'un Sofitel ...		
Sep 12 2007	A Great Experience	Our stay at the W was a great experience - although we rarely went to the vast lounges offered at the W we relied heavily on the concierge to point us in the right direction for food, drinking and shopping. Hugo was excellent and every recommendation was exceptional - including the lounges in Mount Royale. The service at the Hotel was great and everyone was incredibley polite and helpful - including our concierge who brought us bubble bath in a martini glass at 1am. We stayed in a Mega Room and ended up with a corner room - the view was fantastic. The location was right next to the metro and close to downtown and old montreal. Definately will stay here again.	
Dec 30 2006 	'W' is for 'Won't' be going back!	Thoroughly forgettable stay. I've stayed in 2 other W hotels (NYC) and unfortunately their new addition in Montreal does not meet up to the W brand standards. First, we asked upon arrival if our room could be near our friends' room. &quot;No go, hotel is booked solid&quot;. Okay, but the lady at the front desk didn't even try to move some rooms around. It's not like everyone had already checked in at 1:30pm! She snarkily replied that I should have asked when I made the reservation in the first place. Well, we made the reservation for both rooms at the same time; did they expect that we wanted to be as far away from each other as possible? Then our room.... beautiful as expected with two double beds, huge bath, shower and the whole Bliss product line as I've come to expect from any W hotel. Unfortunately, our view looked over some kind of courtyard/office where I could see people working away and going up and down the elevator. At the bottom of this atrium is the W bar. Neeless to say we heard the music until the bar closed, sometime around 3 am. Unforgivable, especially that we had our 10-month old daughter with us! My friends had a few issues too. First the barking dog somewhere on their floor (dogs are accepted here). No little chiwawa here, somekind of big dog. But considering, that was probably a pleasant noise compared to the people next door who were enjoying their honeymoon for everyone to hear. So beware paper thin walls are to be expected.Finally, we ordered food from a local reataurant but they forgot plates. I called the front desk for 4 plates. This is the 'Whenever, Wherever&quot; service you famously here about; they will fulfill any of your desires (within limits of course). The lady at the service desk tried to charge me $8 for the four plates! What?! A bit of negotiating and she let go of the charges. This was not a DESIRE but rather a NEED unless they wanted us to spread our thai food on their lovely pale blue leather ottoman!I was just so let down because the W had become a favorite place of mine (I'm a SPG member).	
Nov 28 2006 	No Attitude	I had read the previous reviews before I even booked my recent stay at this hotel, so I had a good idea of what to expect before I arrived. I decided to go with an open mind and embrace what the hotel was offering. Some of the things other have said about the place is true: The hallways are dark compared to other hotels, the rooms -- and bathrooms -- are very open. The staff is very young and very pretty -- something i didn't consider a negative. The one thing commented upon in many reviews is the staff having lots of attitude. I didn't find that at all. Everyone I encountered from those who who parked my car and carried up my luggage, Katherine at the front desk, the housekeepers upstairs, the concierge, the servers in Otto, and Max (?) the bartender in Wunderbar.... all were very friendly and attentive to my needs. Of the 5 rooms i had during my trip to Canada, the one at the W (#512) seemed to be the largest, probably because of the lack of walls in the space. I had a nice view out the front of the hotel of Victoria Square and the buildings of downtown Montreal. I couldn't hear any noise from the street nor was I able to hear music from the bars downstairs. The bed was very comfortable. I enjoyed the very large shower. I ate in Otto one my nights there and it was very enjoyable. The food seemed to come out of the kitchen a bit on the slowside, but there was a very large party in the restaurant at the same time and having worked in the biz, i know that can really mess up service for others.in the bar there was a local TV channel filming auditions for a reality show and eventhough there were a lot of them there, it didn't seem to keep the bar staff from being friendly and attentive to the other guests there. Overall i very much enjoyed my stay at the W and would refer others who would enjoy the type of environment.... but i would definitely say it's not a hotel for everyone.	
Dec 27 2006 	Over-priced	We stayed here for 3 nights in December (2006), We arrived late and had arranged an airport pick up, but once we arrived at the hotel desperate for some sleep we were left in one of the side rooms while the check in staff stood around and talked, we were then given a talk about the services offered by the hotel, when we declined we were finally shown to our rooms.The room was clean and functionaly, though there was erratic hot water in the bathroom.The staff were of limited help and seemed more interested in offering paid services rather than giving helpful advice (They also have a member of staff on each floor who each time you go back tries to escort you to your room and expects a tip - we ended up trying to tip toe back to our room to avoid this)Dont use the pre paid taxi booth in the reception - this is vastly over pricved, go outside and get an autrickshaw (the pre pay booth charged us 100 ruppees to the train station, the autorickshaw was 20 and its only a 10 min walk away)One very positive point is the roof top restaurant. The food was fantastic, the staff friendly and very helpful and the value was tremendous.Overall, there are many better and substantially cheaper places in Delhi	
Mar 9 2005	Pros 		
Jun 19 2009 	Comfortable Stay	I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; enjoyed my stay . The hotel is very centrally located .The room had a wonderful view . I could see entire Connaught Place. alongwith the &quot;Central Park&quot;, ( I think that's what they call it ! ). The breakfast was included in the room rate , so we could have it in the room or in the restaurant with no extra charges.  &quot; Bonsai &quot; the Restaurant very well done up , vibrant and fresh look , served excellent food and drinks in style ,( nice bar ! ) , not missing the wonderful outside garden area. Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find. I'll be back.	
Mar 20 2009 	Everything is New	The Crest Inn hotel is not located in the best part of Delhi, but to their credit, once you are inside everything is brand spanking new. Our hotel room even still had its furniture in a semi-wrapped state! This is one of the cleanest places you will find in Delhi, it was the only place where the bedsheets and towels did not need to be changed out the minute we entered the room. We also loved the way the room was set-up, especially the presence of a large double bed. Two downsides remain with this inn--the shower area in the bathroom is not segregated so be prepared to have a very wet bathroom floor after you've taken a shower! Secondly, the hotel restaurant is not much for food, so be prepared to head out for all your meals.	
Dec 15 2005	Not a good hotel!	Please do not stay at this hotel...especially if you have kids!We got to the hotel very late in the night...3am,the room was below average, the toilet looked clean but there was a nasty smell, the shower was broken!To top it off though our electricity kept cutting out, that was because I was trying to warm up my baby's milk in the kettle provided...basically everytime I put the kettle on the electric would go, it took 4 phone calls and a visit by the duty manager to rectify this.I asked the manager if our breakfast could be sent to our room as a one off as it was very late now and we may not get up in time, he said he was not sure if he could do that but he would get back to me, guess what,never heard from him after that.Dont stay here if you can help it...disgusting service and manky rooms!	
Nov 15 2009 	Nice place reality of India will hit you in this neighbourhood	We stayed at this hotel a few times. The rooms are OK. The linens are not spotless, definitely had not been changed but this is normal for Indian hotels/hostals (unless you go to upscale places), so bring your own if you wish. Also if you use the AC, there is no blanket and it gets pretty cold. I had my sleeping bad. The first time we stayed the AC worked the whole time and the room was freezing. The next time, the AC was turned off through the main switch downstairs so it got stuffy and hot. Complain and ask for a discount if this happens. Everything is negotiable in India!Rickshaws and taxis are easily accessible, the staff will even fetch you one if needed. Friendly, safe, hot water, good price.Located in Paharganj, metro station (Rama Krishna) is 2min walk, plenty of dirt and beggars, so if your first time and day in India, be prepared to be shocked. New Delhi railway station is super close and a ride with a rickshaw should be no more than 40-50 rupees. Nizamuddin is farther away.	
Sep 19 2009 	low price hotel	The staff was very good specially front office staff. The hotel was very good the tips is only to change your parking locatin near by the hotel. the hotel is bussiness hotel at low price and the services were very good.	
Sep 23 2009 	Hotel people will beat you up careful!	I came for business to Delhi. However I am a frequent traveller and saw a good review of this &quot;so called new hotel&quot;. So decided to catch up this hotel. But oh God it should not be termed as a hotel. It had RATS in the room. The bed sheets were torn. The Aircondition was not working and there was no water when I went to take a shower. The bathroom had so much of foul smell that I had to pack up my bag and just leave. When I wanted to leave they charged me extra money which was not agreed at the time of check in. They forced me to pay. It was a nightmare and I thought the musclemen will come and beat me up, if I dont pay I was horrified.	
Jul 16 2008 	Decent stay	There are a multitude of mid-range hotels in Delhi and the Swati Deluxe is a good choice. One piece of advice regarding hotels in India -- bear in mind that their idea of 3-star may not be what you expect. The hotels are clean and the staff are usually friendly, but it's not going to be in line with what you would expect in the States or in Europe. I would say that the mid-range hotels in India are about on par with economy motels in the States. After the marathon flight, the staff at Swati Deluxe were welcoming. The hotel is a little difficult to find, so be sure you have specific directions/information to provide to your driver. The rooms are clean and they provided towels each day. The attached restaurant has very good selections for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We found it very convenient and enjoyable.	
May 25 2009 	Excellent service but a bit too plain	I like the understated service of Oberoi, but the Oberoi, Delhi is a drab looking property from outside and a bit sleepy from inside. Would recommend it though if you are on a business visit.	
Nov 25 2008 	could be better	If you want to stay at this hotel, do it qiuckly before it falls apart.We stayed there for 4 days while on holiday in India. Although the communal areas like the corridors and the restaurant are OK, the rooms are very disappointing. You will find that some rooms don't have windows. They are clean but in urgent need of redecoration. I mean things like door handles falling of, broken showers, missing taps. The windows look like they have not been washed forever, especially the ones in the bathrooms. The main problem we thought was the state of the electic sockets-they are completely exposed hanging of the walls and impossible to use. When we changed to another room, it was just as bad.Having said that the staff at the hotel were very helpful and understanding so if you only need to be there for a couple of days I guess its good enough just don't expect a lot.	
Apr 15 2007	Misleading Descriptions Beware do not stay here	We recently stayed at this Hotel because of the description on a variety of websites. Dont waste your money there is no swimming pool, the air con tripped after 15secs of turning it on and the metal trip switch had to be turned on with a towel to avoid electrocution , the only window in the room looked out on to the stair well, no mini bar, taxes are not included if you pay directly to the hotel, the keys are not electronic, the towels are grey and linen had dubious stains, no free car parking (if you need to park then its out onto the street at your own risk) the elevator would not accomodate a wheel chair if you needed it. The travel desk / info consists of whoever is on the front desk that has a mate in a travel office (and there are a lot of them) who they call in to get their cut should you spend any money with them - complete sharks....! and this is after a long flight and taxi drivers with lost hotel syndrome who want to take you to their friends travel office to get you to book something so they get their cut too.....it goes on and on so you have to be on your toes....!	
May 7 2009 	There are better hotels available	Compared to other hotels in the same grade and price, this would be low in my list. It is about time that the owner starts to renovate the rooms.	
Jan 6 2009 	Great food decor service impeccably clean	Shanti Home is a great hotel. I had just finished a business trip, having stayed at two five star hotels in two other cities in India, and selected Shanti Home, based on the TripAdvisor reviews, to spend a few vacation days in New Delhi. First trip to India. Compared to the five star hotels I had been in, this is a welcome relief from the size and scale of the large hotels. You get five star service but it's more like a family inn rather than a huge hotel. OK, so there may not be a shelf full of glassware, a stocked refrigerator, TV, and other little useless doodads. Those things may be important for some types of hotel stays, but they really don't matter much to me. The hotel has most of them anyway for the asking, they're just not in each room. Don't get me wrong, the five star hotels are nice, especially for business travel, but at Shanti Home, it's a completely different, yet positive, experience. It's a four or five story building with just two to five rooms, more or less, on each floor. First of all, this is a brand new building- but, unlike &quot;big box&quot; new hotels, this has very carefully thought out architecture, furnishings, and decor which gives you the sense that you are in India---sort of like what a five star, colonial styled historical large inn would be in the U.S. --but with up to date bathrooms and infrastructure. The rooms are scupulously clean, very comfortable, with plenty of room. No &quot;cookie cutter&quot; type of furnishings--these look more like what you'd find in a B&amp;B bedroom rather than a typical hotel room. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They work as a team round the clock to ensure your questions are answered, and anything you need is handled. The owners made a point to meet every guest , on multiple occasions, at dinner on the rooftop restaurant. They put a lot of thought into designing this hotel to achieve a certain look. Regarding the rooftop restaurant, where most guests had breakfast and dinner, had great food, great atmosphere--sort of what I had experienced at La Meridian at another Indian city, but on a smaller scale. I especially enjoyed the fact I could have a standard &quot;eggs, toast, and coffee&quot; breakfast instead of traditional Indian fare. They definitely keep the Western tourist's interests in mind. The tandoori meals and other dinners were outstanding for dinner. The chef and wait staff are very attentive and service is comparable to any top restaurant in the U.S. I spent some time in the lounge using the desk to do some catch-up work on my laptop, which was easy with the wireless internet service. On another floor, there's a TV room with a large flat screen TV where a few people might gather to watch a movie or TV. I was also impressed by the security. There's a large, solid gated door with a guard 24/7 the propery perimeter. So, you get the sense as soon as you walk in that you're in good hands. The receptionist gives you a nice little map which helps the first time you venture out to walk to the train. The neighborhood is full of family residences and is just a few blocks from the train station. From there you can go anywhere in New Delhi with no trouble at all. Great location. I was very impressed with the train service--ultramodern, clean, easy to follow the stops etc. The most ironic thing about Shanti is the price. I was a little suspicious before I decided to come here under the &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; axiom. But, based on the reviews, I took a chance and came here. No regrets-definitely the right choice. My conclusion--this is a steal at this price for the quality and delivery of room, restaurant, service, and location. Overall, if I were to return to New Delhi with my wife for another vacation, this is where I would definitely go, no question.	
Jun 9 2009 	one of New Delhi's largest conference venues	LocationNestled in six acres of lush greens in the exclusive Diplomatic Enclave of the city, Taj Palace Hotel is the only one in the top-of-the-line category near Gurgaon and is a mere 10 minutes drive from the airport.RestaurantFrom casual, all-day eateries to formal, fine dining, guests can look forward to a wide selection of delectable dishes and refreshing drinks at the onsite restaurant.	
Nov 14 2009	Lujoso pero alejado del centro		
Nov 30 2007 	An Oasis in Hectic Delhi	Claridges Hotel was a standout on a recent trip to Delhi. The hotel is in a beautiful residential area of New Delhi and is a modern hotel that recalls the glory days of the British Empire. Definitely a perfect location for an Agatha Christie mystery. This is a small hotel with a large garden and seems to be overstaffed, so service is excellent. Dont be surprised that many of the staff know you by name. The tour desk can be contacted by email prior to arriving and all travel/touring arrangements can be made for the duration of a stay. Our budget room, booked through Asiarooms.com, was well-decorated and the size of a good-sized ships cabin. However, other rooms were quite large. There are several restaurants, but we only had time and energy to eat at the grill for breakfast and dinner, which was ala carte or buffet. Free wireless internet is available in the rooms and throughout the hotel.In and around Delhi, the pace is quite hectic so after a long day it is refreshing to find the calm and restful atmosphere at Claridges. This hotel proved to be an excellent choice both in price, comfort and amenities.	
Nov 1 2007 	Good business hotel convenient to airport	Overall a reliable choice for business travellers to Delhi (was recommended to me by locals) when you don't need to stay in the center of Delhi. I'd stay here again on a return visit.Pros- Well appointed rooms with separate shower/bath. Bottled water provided in room. - Good breakfast buffet, and also good lunch buffet .- Close to the airport (flights can arrive very late in Delhi as mine did 1:30am)- Airport pick up car service worked very well (book this ahead with the hotel, extra charge). (There is the traffic police's prepaid taxi service at the airport as well but I didn't use it.)- Well equipped fitness center for a hotel, with around 10 different cardio bikes/treadmills/ellipticals and half a dozen weight machines plus free weights- Attractive grounds and lobby area, well staffed and very good serviceCons- Room rates in Delhi are high and The Grand is no exception. My cost was over $300/night including breakfast. You might want to book through a local if you have a contact for better rates.- Location is south of the city, nothing to see withing walking distance today (a major new shopping mall is going up nearby so that will change in time). Travel time to center (Connaught Place / India Gate) or the Gurgaon business district can take 30+ minutes by car (hiring a driver for the day is advisable if you have multiple stops or just want to be sure of your transport back. Taxis aren't that common and traffic is nothing short of amazing--can be both chaotic and often jammed with bikes, pedestrians, and every imaginable vehicle on wheels).- Some of the hotel carpet and furniture is tired and worn, but all the natural granite, wood and waterfalls more than make up for it.	
Sep 20 2009 	Our home away from home for seven nights	We loved this hotel. It was our home for a total of 7 nights during our 3 week trip to India this summer. The security is very impressive. We felt very safe and secure in a city which is pretty crazy at times. A full breakfast was included. We had most meals in the 24/7 resturant located on the first floor. Desk people were beautifully dressed and very helpful. Room service was immediate. They even knew our names. All issues were addressed promptly. The pool area is breathtaking. Lounge chairs rest in the water. Service was very impressive. We all had our hair cut and other services of the spa which were first rate. The shop owners in the hotel were especially nice. We bought sari's and beautiful scarves from Kashmiri Arts located on the second floor. We stayed at many hotel during our stay which were nice but the Lalit is in a class all its own.	
Apr 13 2005 	A 2-star masquerading as a 4-star		
Oct 18 2009 	OK lot of scope for improvement	Having previously stayed at The Park in Kolkata I was eager to visit the Delhi version. Located right in the heart of the city The Park had nothing much to offer. I would rather call it a building with a bar, a bakery and a discotheque with some rooms.The rooms are ordinary, the staff and the front desk personnel behaved in a very snobbish way. For once I regretted coming here. The staff seemed more interested in entertaining the guests at the Bar and the discotheque rather than the room guests.The only thing like able was the Flury's bakery, their coffee and cakes were just yummy and made me forgot the other negative points. I would only recommend it to people who want to walk around in Connaught Place and central Delhi.	
Jul 18 2008 	Convenient	We stayed at the Hotel in April - my husband was on business and I was on holiday. The Hotel is tired and needs a refit, we were both a bit disappointed when we arrived as it is classed as a five star Hotel and clearly it isn't.. Our room wasn't particularly clean and I don't think the sheets had been changed. The view from our room was just an awful derelict site. Our room keys never worked and I had to go back down to reception several times a day to get them reprogrammed. The food was good in the restaurant and the bar service attentive, but expensive!! The pool area was okay, but there was a real problem with flies, which made it unpleasant to sit out and the pool bar had a problem with cooling so all the drinks were warm. I had a spa treatment, which was excellent. The staff were very friendly, but desperate for tips, so make sure to take a good supply of lower denomination notes.	
Sep 7 2009 	Good hotel but.....	My husband booked this hotel in Jan 09 for my 50th birthday in Aug, he booked a queen superior &amp; also put on the booking form that it was for a &quot;special birthday&quot; and could we have a room with a nice view. When we arrived we were allocated room 79-it was the SMALLEST room I have even seen, and looking out of the very small window the only view was of a very large white soil pipe running down the middle of the window, when I challenged the porter as to what grade of room it was, he said it was a &quot;pod&quot; room, we explained that we had booked a queen superior he suddenly changed his mind and said yes it was a queen superior! We did get moved to a better room after complaining to the front desk (still no nice view and certainly no up grade, as lots of other people seemed to get in the reviews) In the 4 days we were there only 1 of the 2 elevators worked &amp; we were on the 7th floor. Apart from the above the hotel is in a great location and was clean &amp; tidy. We felt the hotel was all style &amp; no substance, it all looks very classy on the web site.	
Feb 17 2009 	Upscale - moderate price	Purchased 2 rooms, 3 nights through Priceline. Our party consisted of 4 adults, one child. The staff at 70 Park Avenue were so nice. The hotel had a kid's fun kit ready for us at check in and the child with us thought it was great. The kids even get a comment card so they can say what they feel about the hotel - and that was a very &quot;grown up&quot; touch for the child in our group. The rooms, while small, were nicely furnished, clean and quiet (we were on the 16th &amp; 17th floors, though - so maybe some of the lower rooms would hear more street noise). The beds were very comfortable. Both rooms had a view of the Empire State Building! The hotel is 4 short blocks from Grand Central station so getting around was a breeze! We would have liked to have a coffee pot in our room, but the hotel does offer free coffee and tea in the lobby during the morning and we took advantage of it. And there is a Starbucks on the next block. There is a restaurant/lounge at the hotel but we didn't eat there so can't comment on it other than to say it's available. Part of our group did go to the lounge one night. It was tasteful and quiet - the drinks were high priced, but it is a hotel lounge! Lots of restaurants on surrounding side streets and there is a neat market at Grand Central Station - we bought sweet treats there!. We would definitely stay at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel again!	
Jul 31 2007 	Large Suite at Great Price	I booked a one-bedroom deluxe suite with two queen beds on the hotel web site for a non-refundable rate just over $400/night for 3 nights. As of family of 5, most hotels require us to split into two rooms which gets expensive. We were given room 2001 and it was a huge one bedroom apartment! We had a large living room with a sleeper sofa, a large desk and work space, a dining room with a round table and 4 nice chairs, a full kitchen, large bedroom with two queen size beds, a medium sized bathroom and a wonderful large terrace/balcony overlooking 3rd Ave. The best things about the hotel are the location (good safe neighborhood with restaurants, easy to walk places), the size of our room for the price, and the comfortable beds (crisp white down duvets).The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was nicely cleaned every day while we were out. Housekeeping never bothered us in the morning but always had our room spotless when we returned later in the day.Everything worked well in our room - a/c kept us plenty cool, the showers were hot, the drains worked fine. The furnishings were not brand new but were well maintained and very clean.The Affinia 50 was perfect for us! Anyone who desires more space than an average hotel room should consider this hotel.	
Jul 30 2007 	good value good location	Booked at the Affinia after debating many different hotels and booking/cancelling somewhere else. At first we were disappointed that our room was on the 3rd floor (we'd requested a higher floor in hopes of avoiding street noise) but our room was very quiet even though we faced the street and were across from the elevators.Our sink and tub flowed very slowly the 1st day, but we notified the desk staff and it was immediately fixed. The &quot;club&quot; feature was nice, as we left our luggage with the staff on the last day, but went back and freshened up, got some coffee, etc., before catching a cab to our late afternoon flight. Every time we approached the staff, from front desk to doorman to concierge, we were served quickly with a great attitude. Everyone was very accomdating.Rooms were very comfortable, terrific beds, tiny but functional and nice bathroom, and convenient to have all amenities (shampoo, toothpaste, etc., even breath mints!) provided what with airline restrictions. In-room coffee and tea were a nice touch, too.We would definitely stay again.	
Sep 19 2008 	SO WORTH IT!	Just returned from a long weekend in Manhattan and the accommodations at the Affinia Dumont far exceeded my expectations. Check-in was a breeze - - the clerk smiled through the entire 5-minute exchange and the bellman took our luggage promptly, telling us a little about the hotel and general area. The neighborhood (Murray Hill) is wonderful with small shops, lots of pub/restaurants and Gristedes, a lovely grocery where you can find anything you're looking for! Our studio suite was just that, sweet, but the toilet wouldn't flush. No problem! After maintenance showed up (fast!) and decided there wasn't a &quot;quick fix&quot; the front desk gave us another room, upgrading to a junior suite which was even better! Extremely roomy complete with a separate (fully stocked w/pots, plates, glasses, silverware) kitchen, this was our home away from home. We had a fantastic dinner at the Union Square Cafe Friday night, then Saturday night we just picked up some things from Gristedes 2 blocks away and had a picnic in our cozy, beautiful room. We could have saved maybe $12 a night parking at a different lot, but I felt my car was safer with Affinia and a few $$$ wasn't worth the worry. Each and every person we came into contact with at the hotel was friendly and efficient. Our unit was immaculately clean and the furnishings were plush. The bed was incredibly comfortable! We couldn't have been happier with the accommodations and will stay only with them whenever we travel to NYC. I've heard horror stories about other hotels, both from friends and from reviewers, and I feel confident that the Affinia Dumont will take good care of us next time too!	
Nov 26 2009 	Unforgettable Service	I stayed at the affinia gardens earlier this month, I must say my stay was unforgettable. I was making a transition from my hometown of Boston to New York, for work purposes. I came in with my mother for a few days, Melissa was the person to check us in and Michael took the bags to the room. I stay for a few days and during my stay the staff was very helpful and pleasant. Glenda the night person was very resourceful, making sure I got extra pillows and towels during the late night hours. I liked the area so much, my new apartment is only 3 blocks away from the hotel. My family will definitely be coming to the hotel more offen, I was impressed with this oasis on the Upper East Side. Other people that made my stay great where, Jennifer, Shefi, Caprice	
Dec 6 2007 	Great Neighbourhood Massive Rooms	I chose this hotel mainly due to the great feedback they had. I have to say that I was impressed with the hotel before I even got there. The receptionist Latoya was really helpful and arranged a Limo to collect us and to have a bottle of champagne in the room, she even emailed me a day beforehand to let me know the name and number of the limo driver. The hotel is on the Upper East Side and E64th Street has some beautiful properties. We stayed in a Junior King Suite and had a garden as well. The bed was massive and the pull out sofa bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was nicely equipped and the extra dressing area was well appreciated with 3 women trying to get ready. The welcome we received on booking in was great as well.I only had one minor gripe and this was that it took 3 requests to get bedding for the sofa bed, but every other request was attended to. All of the reception staff were really friendly and always said hello and greeted us with a smile. It had the atmosphere of a family run business which I much prefer. There was no noise at night and the garden was fantastic when it started to snow. The receptionist also recommended a town car to take us back to the airport and organised it all for us.I was a little disappointed that when we asked to extend our checkout time the receptionist was initially going to let us have it free, but the manager intervened and wanted to charge us a half day charge of $260 which we thought was a little excessive. They stored our bags with no hassle at all.I would definately recommend this hotel - the majority of the staff were extremely helpful and went the extra mile. The service I received at Affinia Gardens is definately well above many other hotels I have stayed in. Try JoJo down the road and right next door Alice's Tea Cup. Jo Jo is probably one of the best restaurants I ever ate in.	
	Be Warned!!!	I booked a 4-star room through Priceline (my first mistake). A few days before checking in, I called the 1-800 reservation number to confirm the reservation and (based on the reviews on TA) to request a high-floor and quiet room (knowing the better rooms are on the higher floor). This was confirmed by the telephone agent.When I checked in, I was given a room on the 10th floor. I pointed out this didn't match my request, and was informed that my request had been noted, but a higher floor would be an extra $100, but as a special gesture, I'd be given it for $50. I refused to pay extra, and decided to check the room that was offered. The room was awful, to say the least. Granted, the room was very large (especially for a Manhattan hotel), but it obviously dated from the mid-80s at best. The carpet seemed dirty, the furniture old and beaten, overall what one would expect from a two-star motel - not the 4-star hotel I paid for.I politely, but firmly insisted to the front desk manager that I wanted to be moved to a room more in keeping with my reservation requests. I was moved to another, admittedly larger, room, but still of the same calibre. Again, I refused what was being offered, and demanded a room that at least somewhat resembled the rooms displayed on the hotel's website (I did use the terms &quot;false advertizing&quot;, which I feel is the case). I was eventually moved to a room that was more in keeping with what I had paid for, requested, and seen on the hotel's website.Be warned: the Afinia Manhattan is under renovation. The renovated rooms are a good deal: they are very large, offer a small kitchenette, have more up-to-date furnishings and the hotel is in an exceedingly convenient location. The unrenovated rooms are old and tired. The term &quot;standard room&quot; is the Afinia's euphemism for &quot;dirty, old, decrepit room&quot;. Don't accept a &quot;standard&quot; room, and don't accept to pay a supplement for a renovated room. Demand to be given a room that matches the hotels advertisement, which is what you paid for.Businesses have an obligation to be truthful in their advertising. Of course, hotels will always use photographs that show their amenities to their best, but to only display photos of the updated portions of the hotel and then expect guests to accept less than that is unacceptably misleading.BTW, this is the first and last time I book through Priceline - but that is another topic.	
Jun 10 2009 	good location however bit noisy and no curtains meant bright rooms	Overall a good stay. Clean hotel and room and of a very good size compared to when I stayed at the Hudson a few yrs ago.Bathroom slightly small, only one person at a time!!. We were on the 4th floor and u could defiantely here everything that was going on,. There is a fire station nearby. The windows had whithe blinds but these did nothing to stop the light in the morning. If u are an early starter and not got a hangover and getting in from clubbing at 5am then this aint a problem!! Also there was a convention on our floor so lots of ppl milling aroundFriendly staff and overall very good and would prob stay again but I would ask for a top floor.	
Nov 24 2008 	Fantastic hotel	This hotel is great! We booked a one bedroom suite through expedia as it was cheaper than booking directly with the hotel. The rooms are massive with a huge bedroom and living room, two bathrooms, plenty of cupboard space and a kitchen fully equipped with full size fridge, freezer, oven and gas hob.Staff were helpfu. Rooms very clean. It has a coin operated laundry downstairs which is v. useful if travelling with kids.Hotel is a 5min walk to macys and Penn Station. 15mins to Times Sqaure. 20 mins to Filenes Basement at union square.Brilliant location- we walked everywhere because pram and subway do not mix.Nearest places to get food:1. Jacks 99c store. Cheap and cheerful. Entrances on 31st and 32nd streets. Buy snacks, bread, drinks here. Sells everything apart form fresh food like fruit or veg.2. Whole FoodsWalk 10mins down 7th Avenue away from macys. Expensive, all-organic but very nice. Like Waitrose. It has fresh veg and fruit, fish meat etc.3. Delis around the hotelVery very expensive but convenient if you just want to buy some milk or ice cream!Only downside is the noise which is not the hotel's fault. Centre of new york is going to be noisy. the fire station next door is extra noisy but it did not wake us or the baby up at night. I would definatly stay here again but would ask for a room on the opposite side of the building from the fire station to get a bit of distance from the sirens!	
Sep 16 2009 	Very nice...convenient location!	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. The rooms were really nicely sized, with a separate area that had a fridge/micro and sink! The bed was so very comfy! The bathroom is a bit small...but very clean and very nicely decored. There is a long desk, and the tv was really great (flat panel that extends out). There is an extra chair for lounging. The closet was nice, and the hangers were the type you could actually pul off and use! My only disappointment was that we requested a high floor and got floor 5 with no view except for the other side of the building. There is no gift shop or market (unlike the Dumont). You will have to walk to 34th to Murray Hill Market (or call for delivery). The restaurant RARE was ok...we had take out, it was nothing special. Overall, we loved the hotel...it was really nice (elevator needs to be updated). It would be nice if the hotel had a small gift shop area for water, drinks..etc--but it's New York~you can find somewhere close by. Door men are really nice as well! :) Last but not least..you have to pay for interent, we paid the $62.95 for the week. It would have been nice if the hotel offered FREE wifi, but then again if most hotels in the area do not, then I understand why this hotel didn't.	
Nov 1 2008 	Not what I expected - but good anyway	Surprisingly quiet and with fantastic beds this hotel became our haven during the week in NYC . Renovation is still on-going but hasn't disturbed us at all. The rooms were clean and spacious. I had expected more from the &quot;suite&quot; descriptions and web photos which made me think of an extra sofa, perhaps a table etc. Our rooms were simply standard single hotel rooms, but fine as such. The staff was friendly and efficient.So, is it worth the price? Probably, but which Manhattan hotel is really? To charge extra for interet is insulting. At these rate levels, why can't that be included?	
Feb 21 2008 	Great location 	Never having been to NY before and travelling with 4.5yr old twin boys we spent 4 nights in NY and chose the Shelbourne Murray Hill after reading other trip advisor reviews and much research of location - we were not disappointed! The suite was a fantastic size and looking out onto the Empire State Building too - large lounge with dining table and chairs was just so convenient with kids. The location on Lexington avenue is great - handy for central station (10 minutes) where all underground trains run through; possible to walk to 5th avenue, madison etc and Macys for shopping!Highly recommend the food from the Hotel Restaurant - we were going to eat in but it has a 'bar' feel with lots of people standing around drinking so the manager organised for our food to be taken to the room - they have a lovely lounge area near reception and this was great for a break too. Room service was convenient at night.Bedroom huge, very comfortable beds and kitchen / bathroom OK - they could do with renovation for sure but adequate. We enjoyed putting our children to bed and then relaxing in our 'lounge' with a glass of wine over dinner. Other plus is there are laundry facilities in the basement so again, ideal if you have children with you.Empire State is 10 minutes walk and at night there are no queues and fab views - the boys loved it. There are some great places to eat nearby and we enjoyed the Cuban cafe for a brilliant soup and sandwich - excellent with kids too.Our overall impression is of a very well run hotel, friendly reception staff and excellent doorman - he was cool with our boys; for the price that we paid it was great value - we used the book in advance, pay in advance, no cancellation offer - half the price so well worth it. We would definately recommend this hotel to anybody for location, service and value and ideal if taking children on a city break.	
Mar 22 2006	The most comfortable beds ever!!!!	This place may be tired on the decor but when you're in New York City....who's gonna be looking at the hotel decor when you have the Empire State Building at your doorstep!!! After long hours of exploring the Big Apple, it was nice to come back to a clean and quiet hotel where the staff are amazing and the beds make you feel like you're sleeping on clouds. Go up to the 16th floor and let your jaw drop down to the floor with amazement at the view! I would recommend this hotel for anyone who's looking for comfort and great value for money, right in the heart of midtown manhattan!!! Thanks and I'll be back again very soon I hope!!!	
Dec 15 2006 	Fair value!!	We stayed here from dec9 til dec13 2006 and here is our experience:We stayed in a a premier suite, for an average price of 500$ per night. The suite was quite big, bedroom separated from living room. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very clean and large enough and the living room has 1 large couch, and 2 others seats. The room included 2 flat screen tvs, with hbo. Staff was very friendly and very helpful (if needed). Location of the hotel is very convenient for a tourist visit to nyc.Relative to others hotels of this category in nyc, this one is fairly priced and maybe a notch better located than some others. We would warmly recommend this one or stay here again.	
Jul 11 2009 	Amsterdam Court	Tiny room that smelled funny. I'm not sure if it was smoky or just old.But for $100 a night, couldn't beat the location!! The staff was always helpful.	
Jul 4 2006	Great Price and Location	My partner and I stayed at the Amsterdam Court Hotel for 3 nights at the end of June. First off the front desk staff were friendlly and efficent. We were on the 7th floor and omg our room was small, but hey, it's Manhattan who cares. The room was decently decorated with a comfortable bed and a really nice bathroom. I found it to be very clean, safe and comfortable. Air conditioning wasn't that great and the elevator was a little slow but we paid $150 cdn on Expedia. If we were staying at say the Waldorf or The W I am sure I could find a lot to complain about this hotel is definately worth the money in my opinion. You are a half block off Times Square, right across the street from the Gershwin Theatre (where Wicked is playing) everything you need is right there. I am going back in August and I will be staying at the Amsterdam Court Hotel again.	
Nov 23 2009 	Brilliant stay at this hotel	This hotel is opposite central park and subway into the centre only 3 blocks away. Me and my friend stayed here. Clean, own bathroom, room small but we didn't spend much time there, just somewhere to sleep and wash. Hotel staff very helpful, we booked our sightseeing bus tour at hotel. Great little diner about 2 blocks away recommended by hotel and they even booked our cab back to airport, which was the same price as yellow cab but a licoln car, looked liked a limo. Price was good and couldn't fault this place. Definately recommend to others.	
Sep 12 2009 	excellent value for money	me and my husband stayed here for 3 nights last december, i had read the reviews and was really worried about some of them and even concidered changing hotel, but once we arrived at the hotel i thought it was fab, pretty basic really but excellent value if u are on a budget.i was worried about the location but dont be the subway is a few minutes walk away and its so cheap to use and once you get used to it its fab and will save u loads on taxis.i would def stay at this hotel again!!!	
Jul 19 2008 	"Saved the best til last"	We are two girls in our twenties and stayed in this hotel from the 23rd-27th January 2008. We would not consider this a good location for girls travelling on their own as you need to get the sub or a taxi into town due to the distance and would not walk around the neighbourhood at night. The room was an average size but when lying in our beds they were on a slope - very interesting! We also were awoken with a darfader like sound coming from the heating system followed by a loud banging sound, but gave out no heat so we were freezing! Overall the room was clean and we would have to agree with other reviews the bathroom was the best feature, BUT on our last night when entering the bathroom we were greeted with something neither of us owned in the toilet!!! We had to call the cleaner re our BIG issue and he was very good and came up to sort it out straight away. Astor on the Park is ok for what you pay for and after all you are there to see New York, but it definitly gave us a few laughs and stories to tell up on our return!	
Mar 16 2007	Excellent value	My wife and i have just returned from a 7 day stay at the Astor on the Park.We found it very comfortable, clean and excellent value for money. The staff were helpful and friendly.At the time of booking we asked for and got a room overlooking Central Park. The room was fine, far from luxury but more than adequate.Although the hotel is quite a way uptown it is very accesible by subway, the station is just 2 blocks away. But we mainly used the bus M10 that stopped right outside the hotel and takes you to the heart of mid-town Manhattan. A weekly ticket for unlimited use on buses and subway costs just $24. A cab from Times Square to the hotel costs $13. We actually enjoyed being a bit further away from the tourist areas. It felt more like staying in the real New York. Some parts of the surrounding area aren't that hot, but these are easily avoided. There is also plenty around the hotel worth seeing. Columbia University, the Cathedral of St John the Divine and Morningside Park are a short walk away. Also, if you're a Seinfeld fan you will want to visit Tom's restaurant which is near Columbia University on Broadway, about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Of course you can also visit it if you're not a Seinfeld fan and enjoy the excellent value food!The down points to the hotel were;- Blocked toilet (fairly common based on other reviews. My tip to avoid this is, um, to flush regulalry, little and often!!!- Over hot central heating (despite it being minus 10 outside)! But just put the aircon on to deal with that.- The whole hotel could do with re-carpetting.- Make sure you don't do as my wife did and use the local call number when phoning from the room using the very cheap phone cards. Use the freephone number. On some phone cards this is not that clear. We had to pay a $79 bill on checking out because of that.All in all though, considering the rate for this hotel it was a great stay. We would go back again.	
Jul 11 2007	Avoid unrefurbished rooms!	When we first arrived at the Bedford (around 9pm) we had fairly good impressions. We were booking two rooms and while the receptionist had no problems booking in the first room (#301), he said we had to wait for someone to come downstairs. Eventually, a couple come down and say &quot;No, we don't like that room either,&quot; and hand back a set of keys for #310 before leaving the hotel altogether, luggage in tow and calls of &quot;We still have to charge you for one night!&quot; coming from the receptionist.Guess which room we got? Yep, 310. When we got into both 301 and 310 we were appalled - the rooms were old, dirty and smelly. Yes Mr Porter Man, feel free to turn on the a/c, but you're not going to hide the dingy mess you've led us to.We'd read on TripAdvisor that there were some refurbished rooms so we marched down to the lobby and complained, only to be told there was nothing they could do that night and to come back tomorrow. Eventually the porter came upstairs and sprayed each room with strong air freshener (only marginally better smelling), but this did nothing for the faded wallpaper and hole in #310's closet.The next morning we went downstairs and asked to be switched - surprisingly, the receptionist did it without questioning why. I can only surmise that they know what 301 and 310 is like.Our next rooms, 1101 and 1110, were much better. Functioning ACs, no bad smells, king beds, cleaner bathrooms and bigger TV combine to make a nice place to stay, while the fridge also has it's uses.Don't get me wrong, Bedford still has some downsides - the 'high speed internet access' borders on false advertising, the beds are hard and only my AC lets me specify a temperature, but compared to some rooms here 1101 and 1110 are wonderful.Our final comment - if you must stay here, stay only in refurbished rooms. Otherwise, head elsewhere. The fact the hotel is only one block away from Grand Central Station is good, but this can only make up for so much.	
Nov 7 2005	Comfortable stay	We were quite nervous after reading all the reviews but our six nights in this hotel were good. The roomwas big and both the double bed and pull-out bed were big and comfortable. The fridge was handy for water and juice. Some minor problems like hot/cold showersand broken room safe but not serious enough to cause any problems with our stay. The best thing about this hotel is location, location, location. If you are not a perfectionist then this hotel is suitable for staying in.	
Sep 14 2005	What a location !	We stayed at the Beekman for 4 days at the end of July during New York's heat wave! Our room didn't get freezing cold but it did stay comfortable. I mean seriously when it is 105 outside how do you expect your room to stay at 70! The staff has to be THE friendliest I have ever dealt with! We had just gotten off of a cruise and decided to extend our vacation and I feel like I got better service from the Beekman than I did the cruise line. It was pretty much a 5 dollar cab ride to anywhere we wanted to go in New York and a reasonable walk to all the major attractions and shopping. I loved the Beekman and will definately stay again when I return in December! The room was large and although promised a King sized bed we received a queen. The room was very large and the kitchen was a great feature that I did use to store ice cream and take home food from the restaraunts. The Top of the World or tower? was delicious and had amazing views! The price was the best part of it all on top of the cleanliness of the room! Overall the best in New York for those on a budget!	
Jul 20 2008 	Wierd dirty yuk	This is one strange place. Dirty too. Dead bugs and other debris on the carpet. No bathroom in the room. A weird arrangement of tiny hallways cutting off of each other, making you wonder who (or what!) is lurking behind the next corner. The cool, contemporary check-in desk is the only thing nice about this ugly, odd, disconcerting place. I couldn't wait to get out, and recommend you never get in. You would think that for all of the above disadvantages it would be cheap. But the fact is that for the same money there are plenty of decent places on the upper west side. Yuk.	
May 21 2006	Great budget hotel	I stayed at the Belleclaire Hotel after finding it on the internet, on my 6th visit to NYC in November 2005. I was careful to book a twin share room with a private bathroom, but upon arrival found the room was a double. Within minutes, my cousin and I were checked into a great little twin room that had been recently refurbished. The beds were comfy, the linen was crisp and fresh, the quilts new and the pillows soft and fluffy! The bathroom was clean and had been renovated with a regular size bath and shower over.Typical of New York hotels, my view was of a brick wall, but I wasn't in New York City to sit in my room to look at the view so that didn't bother me at all. The staff were really friendly and more than helpful with tourist info. The location is perfect for those not so keen on staying in the hustle and bustle of midtown and I found it to be really quiet. It's a good half hour walk down Broadway to Times Square (maybe longer), but a pleasant stroll after a meal or a show. It's also a great location to stay if you're interested in museums and exploring Central Park. The subway is a mere hop skip and jump away so easy to get anywhere in Manhattan.Big bonus having a 24 hour supermarket next door and the 24 hour Manhattan Diner diagonally across the road that did a great brunch! At least I think it was open 24 hours! Oh, and the pizza place next door looked like a dive, but did awesome slices of pizza.All in all, a great little budget hotel for people who have maybe been to New York before and are looking for something a little quieter. Would I stay there again? Yes. Enjoy New York! And for those of you who thought the lift was too small ... get out of the hotel and enjoy the fabulous energy of New York City instead of spending time in the lift!!!	
Sep 7 2009 	Una vacanza bellissima in un Hotel confortevolissimo		
May 22 2008 	Nice but needs TLC	The rooms are large for new York, I found it very noisy and there was a few things in my room which did not work despite my reporting them.	
Feb 19 2006	Needs To be Reviewed	First of all stayed at Bentley Hotel as a Travel Agent for 8 nights, from 10th Feb till 18th Feb 2006.I booked this hotel with one of our suppliers for the price yes and for the fact that on the 21st floor it showed a beautiful restuarant overlooking the Queensborough Bridge.The famous restuarant was still not open for business till now March even though I rang the hotel in January and was assured it would be open for Valentines Week.After reading all the reports on Trip advisor I have to say I was worried sick on what was going to greet me when i arrived at The Bentley Hotel.Yes it is right next to the Animal rescue centre and Yes there is a Gas station right up against the windows of reception. I did a bit of dectective work and it seems that the building used to be offices which is why it still looks that way from the outside.Inside it is airy in recept and our room 1911 on the 19th Floor was large but even that high up with only single glazing the traffic noise is terrible.The bathroom was beautifully laid out and the piping hot water was nice too but with the lack of any extractor fan in the bathroom as soonas you opened the door the whole bedroom would fill with steam and hence huge amounts of condensation filled the room. Now normally you would think thats ok I will open the window but not here there was no wsmall window at all just 2 huge single glazed windows.The heating worked on a mind of its own, staying there for the worst cold spell this year it wasn't even luke warm and on the days it reached 60f outside we came into the room with the heating on full.Most descriptions give teh Bentley stating mini bars yes you get the cupboard where it should be but no bar and as no restuarant there was little else to do but eat out all the time.The free coffee machine in reception hardley ever worked and the bar for recption is a marble slab, with a man sitting behind it with a few infact 4 bottles of spirits and a bucket withabout 10 bottles of beer in it.I was not amused as were many of the americans staying at the hotel also.Aside from all this the cleaning of our room was perfect and the bed was fanstatic to sleep in...But as for giving the hotel 3*** I would find that very hard t do maybe 2** but no more than that.I travel the globe with my job and it certainly didnt come up to the standards that I was held to believe it had in both its offical description and its star rating.Depending on how many red lights you were held up with the Lexington subway was 10-20 mins walk.Diners: Burger Heaven,Tramway.Dinner/ Try Michael Jordans restuarant at Grand central, but be prepared very $$$$$$$.Another good place 44th &amp; XX restuarant.If it was a choice of The Bentley or another hotel, I am afraid it would have to be another simply because the standards are not up to scratch.Liam - [-------------]( We will be adding a proper photograpgh of the outside of the hotel shortly).	
Aug 21 2009	Great value hotel in a great location	My son and I stayed here in July for our first trip to NY. We booked a 'double double' so we could have a double bed each. The hotel is modern and clean and the staff really friendly and helpful. The only complaint I would have is that the walls seem to transmit noise very clearly and we had quite a bit of noise of other guests slamming room doors at all hours.The room was big enough without being massive and the beds were some of the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. The real high point though is the location. Walk out of the front door and you are just on the edge of Chinatown with all its colour and activity, surrounded by Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese etc. restaurants. A few hundred metres down Grand St. and you have Little Italy. All this area feels very safe and we wondered around until the early hours without ever feeling threatened in any way. It's also not too far to walk over Brooklyn Bridge which we did late one night.Less than 10 minutes away is Canal St. with all the (good quality) fakes and also one of the larger subway stations with great connections to the rest of the city.I would highly recommend it.	
Mar 15 2009 	Couldn't beat the price. Watch room location.	We got the special rate of 89$ (1 night) for this room on travel zoo, which was awesome! We arrived on 3/14 around 1:30 p.m. our room was not ready. We were told check in was at 4 p.m. No biggie. We left bags and went sightseeing/ for a walk. The neighborhood is in Chinatown/Little Italy. When you walk into this establishment you must ride the elevator to the 2nd floor to check in. There are plenty of shopping restaurants, bars- you name it in this area. We got back at 4 p.m. and our room was ready. We got on the elevator to go to our room and we looked at each other and said, Which room number is it? The employee forgot to write the room number o the key card holder. We traveled back down to the check in and were given a room number. The rooms are tiny, but stylish. We walked to Katz Deli- known for their sandwiches for a snack. Well, a BIG snack. Rooms- Our room faced Bowery St. The only negative thing about this room was it was EXTREMELY noisy. I slept maybe 1 hour. I am not complaining due to the price we scored, but bring ear plugs or maybe some sleeping aid to help you. I am from the city, but Bowery can be busy at night. The bed was nice and comfy. The flat screen television was a delight. We really liked the style of the bathroom. The rubber  like walls and shower were very hip. I wasnt feeling well, so we woke up at 6 a.m. and left for home. The continental breakfast was nothing to write home about. The cereal was a tad stale. With all of the bakeries in the area, the hotel should look into teaming up with one of them for the breakfast. Overall, our stay was right for the money. Perhaps if I was feeling better, I wouldnt sleep through the night, but it was very noisy, so I suggest asking for a room away from the street. The higher the rooms the better view. We checked out the exercise room- a couple of machines to keep one occupied. The rooms have internet and 2 computers in the lobby. Nice view from the room too! Location was awesome! Have a great stay!	
Sep 28 2008 	Assolutamente sconsigliato		
May 23 2006	Perfect for Four Adults	Stayed 5 nights at this terrific hotel. In this suite hotel, my husband and I had the room with the king-sized bed while our sons, 23 and 20 had the room with the two twin size beds. Juice, fruit, bagels, cereal, coffee etc stocked in fridge every night. #4,5,6 subway just two blocks away. We walked to Rockefeller Center. Very nice grocery store and less expensive restaurants on 2nd Avenue. Clean and comfortable. 49th street can be a little noisey but we just turned the fan on high. Living room, dining area and kitchen. If you're looking to stay in midtown, this is a great place. I would recommend for families.	
Oct 17 2005	Great value	Stayed over a weekend. Hotel is very convenient to Ground Zero, Battery Park, and Wall Street, all of which are within walking distance. Short cab ride into Little Italy or Chinatown.Rooms are small but nicely appointed and very quiet. Continental breakfast was good, newspaper and more substantial food at the deli next door. The Fulton fish market adds color and odor in the early morning but is pretty much closed by 9:00 or 10:00.You'll have to walk a block or two to get a cab. Be sure to take a card with the hotel address...we had three taxi drivers that did not know where the hotel was located.$200 for this room is a bargain in New York.	
Nov 15 2004	Beware	One short item: After coming back to my room after being out all day, the door was not locked. Needless to say, not a good experience.	
Mar 29 2009 	Solid choice for Times Square	This is a good, clean hotel at a good price for Times Square. One big plus I didn't see referenced here was that it is adjacent to a parking garage that charges guests only 25 bucks for 24 hours -- a stunning bargain in this location. I'm giving four instead of five stars only because I didn't think it was a &quot;five star&quot; place in terms of luxury. But for the combination of service, cleanliness and value I doubt there's a better choice in Times Square. My one night's stay was not as quiet as others have reported, but I am an exceptionally light sleeper and didn't expect utter silence in this location anyway. (Note that there was street noise, but no noise from neighboring rooms.) The service lived up to its TripAdvisor reputation: very professional, respectful and responsive. In my particular room, the &quot;Moroccan&quot; theme, such as it was, amounted to wicker furniture and Moorish patterns in the window dressing. If you've stayed in the ownership group's other places - e.g. Library Hotel, Giraffe -- the level of comfort, quality and customer service will be familiar.	
Nov 10 2008 	Haven of peace in a hectic city	We stayed in the Casablanca Hotel for a week in October 08 and really enjoyed our stay.We arrived in a rain storm and were a bit apprehensive when we saw the small door of the hotel on the opposite side to a building site!We need not have worried  we were warmly greeted and checked in with no problems and we were assured of a quiet room, as we had requested.Our room (310) was quiet as promised. And it was a reasonable size with plenty of storage space and a safe (which we believe every hotel room should have one). Also the main room light was in the centre of the room and gave good lighting. (Why do the majority of hotel rooms have the lighting at the sides of the room, which can make for dark rooms?)The bathroom was also a reasonable size and very clean. There was a small set of drawers in the bathroom giving ample space for storage of our nick-knacks  a nice touch. There was the usual supply of toiletries. The bath towels could have been a bit bigger.The bed linen and towels were changed every day  housekeeping even came round in he evening to check if we needed the towels changed  another nice touch. They also provide a bar of chocolate each evening  much better that the measly bits of chocolate provided in some hotels.The lounge (Ricks) turned out to be the hotels biggest benefit. It was a quiet haven in the hustle &amp; bustle of New York  you would not believe you were half a block from Times Square.For breakfast there was a choice of Fruit Salad, Cereals, Yoghurt, Fruit and Pastries, with plenty of coffee (including de-caff). The food and coffee were replenished promptly. The one drawback was that there were only a few tables where you could sit to eat properly  the remainder of the seating was easy chairs and sofas  fine for the wine and cheese, but not the best for eating a bowl of cereal (maybe we are getting picky in our old age!) Breakfast time could also be busy so finding any seat was sometimes a problem.The evening Wine &amp; Cheese time was one of the best points of the hotel  it is an excellent idea and just right to return to (several) glasses of wine (a choice of white, red or sparkling) and some cheese and biscuits after battling through Times Square. In this case the easy chairs and sofas were just right!For the rest of the day and evening Ricks provided complementary Coffee, Hot Chocolate and Cookies  again just right after returning from the theatre.There is only one PC with internet access in Ricks and whilst we had to wait a few times this was not a big issue  no-one hogged the PC unnecessarily.All the staff were extremely helpful. Any problems were promptly fixed (For example, our room was initially too hot  the radiator was stuck at high, but this was fixed whilst were out.) The servers in Ricks cleared plates away swiftly and made sure the tables were clean. The Lobby staff were extremely helpful and were full of suggestions on where to go etc.All in all an excellent hotel in a marvellous town!Some tips:There is a Post office a block and half up 43rd street  just turn left out the hotel.There is an Information Office close by: Turn right out of the hotel, then right and it is about three blocks down. You can buy tickets for the Bus Tours here and much more.For UK visitors, if you are visiting Meadowlands/Giants Stadium, then take your passport if you want a beer. They only serve you after producing either your passport or US Drivers Licence. Even though I am over sixty (and look it) I was refused a beer.Eating:Tonys (right next door)  excellent Italian food  the portions can be large  although the lunchtime portions are more manageable.The Red Flame Diner 44th Street between 5th &amp; 6th Avenues  excellent place for good non-pretentious cheap food - the soup is excellent  just right for a light meal.Johns Pizzeria  44th Street  very good Pizza (although not as good as Santaniellos in Bedford, UK). You can have a variety of toppings on the same Pizza  excellent to share.Juniors  for Cheesecake  two locations: Brooklyn (386 Flatbush Avenue) or Grand Central Station.Restaurant Row is on 46th Street between 8th &amp; 9th  loads of restaurants for (almost) every conceivable type of food	
Sep 21 2009 	I can't recommend this hotel highly enough	I have just returned from New York after spending 5 fabulous nights at the Cheslea Pines with a group of girls to celebrate my birthday. What a treat this place is. Clean, stylish, incredibly welcoming, and an all round pleasure to stay in. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff were brilliant, so friendly and helpful (even putting up with 6 girls in high heels clattering around the place) and the added touch of a bunch of flowers in my room on my birthday was a lovely surprise. The 3 rooms we stayed in were really spacious, clean and the beds were so comfortable!Breakfast each morning was also an added treat, where yummy bagels, muffins and home made breads were all laid out waiting for us. A lovely way to start the day.The location is excellent, with a subway stop just down the street. All in all, we had a lovely time and I'm so glad I found this gem of a place!	
Aug 30 2009 	The Best Experience	We are from Northern California. Our trip to NYC was a once in a lifetime experience. Our stay at Club Quarters-Downtown during the first two weeks of July of 2009, exceeded all of our expectations by a large margin. It was simply fabulous. Even though we made our reservations through Priceline, we were treated like royalty. They were able to meet all of our requests. We were especially moved by the hotel managers personal gestures of providing us with a free room upgrade, a free bottle of wine and a free bag of chocolate covered almonds upon our arrival. Amazing!!All of the staff, from the Guest Service Managers to the bellboy to the housekeeping personnel to the restaurant staff provided us with the finest customer service. One evening, my wife and I were separated and she was out of our room without a key or her purse. She went into the bar, and happened to sit next to the restaurant manager. After striking up a conversation, she explained her situation. The manager gave her drinks on the house. Outstanding!!!After reading reviews and viewing photos on tripadvisor.com, travel.yahoo.com and insiderpages.com we had some concerns regarding out stay at Club Quarters-Downtown. Not one of our concerns surfaced during our stay. Remarkable!!!!We hope as many travelers as possible read this review and decide to stay at Club Quarters-Downtown. They will not be disappointed; indeed, they will be thrilled. We may not be able to return to NYC, but if we do, we hope we can stay there again.	
Jun 13 2009 	Good Catch for a Great Price	Looking for a inexpensive yet good hotel room always seems to be a challenge in NYC However, after staying at the Club Quarters in Rockefeller Center, I have to say I was very impressed and satified with my stay. Location is great, front desk got us in our room very quickly not to mention they were very pleasant. The room was very modern and clean. A bit small and very business like however would still stay here over and over again.	
Apr 4 2008 	good location!	Room was not a little small (the bed as well) and had no view at all, but it was clean, had a good bathroom and the location was perfect for our 4 day NY trip. 5th avenue and central park are around the corner and around the other corner you can walk to times square &amp; the empire state building. Around the third corner you find Rockefeller center subway with just one stop away from connections to the other lines. Will I stay again in the hotel on another stay... I think I might, although I will explicitly ask for a room located at the front so you have a view and a larger bed!	
Oct 14 2007 	Offers so much but lacks on delivery	The hotel offers so much - great location, great facilities (e.g., free internet, printing, lounge, kitchenette in some rooms, great price for a New York hotel) but - the staff need more training in customer service and the lift takes for ever. I had problems with my room - blocked toilet/telephone didn't work/ distinct smell of previos occupant (a smoker or pet owner). I had to complain 3 times before someone finally fixed the toilet. I complained and was upgraded, but the staff didn't tell me about the telephone messages received when my phone was not working. A few hours before final check out my toilet was blocked again and so was the only public access toilet in the hotel. I was offered another room for my last 2 hours there - nice offer but all I wanted was a toilet!!!There were lots of unhappy people riding the lifts. This hotel offers so much potential, but fails to deliver. They need better trained staff and need to maintain their facilities especially the lift service and toilets to a better standard.	
Jul 9 2007 	Marvelous hotel	Club Quarters Rockefeller Center was centrally located both to Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping, and bus loop areas. For those travelers who wish privacy and quiet, this is the hotel for you. The room was spacious for two people, a/c, well lit, clean, nice view of the cathedral--although the bathroom was small, it had a full shower. I was very pleased with the staff, courteous and very helpful. My stay in New York City was a hit.	
Jun 24 2003	Best on a budget		
Jan 21 2007 	You Get What You Pay For	Stayed for 7 nights over New Year period. Great location for sightseeing! Worst shower I have ever experienced. No pressure &amp; then the temp changes randomly between burning hot to freeezing cold! Not a pleasant way to start each day! The hotel looks tired but it was cheap! So if you want a great location but willing to compromise on some luxeries it is ok.	
Jun 23 2005	Not our best choice	Room for 2 for site seeing and Yankees game, only 1 night stay. Cant say that I would venture back to the same hotel in NY. Yes, Alex was great, he advised multiple things to see and gave decent directions. Only 1 of 2 elevators were working on the day we stayed, making the wait a little long. The elevators were about a 5x5 size so not many people (luggage) could even fit for the trip up or down. Getting off on the 7th floor, the entry flooring was damaged and in bad need of repair. The room was just as bad. Yes we had what looked to be clean bedding and towels. The air conditioning was a well worn window unit and I also noticed the heating system enclosed in a wall cover that was really out of shape. The drapes and sheers would not open properly over the window unit, so we had to utilize chairs to hold back the drapes so the air would flow into the room. We did not need to use the tiny closet area. The bathroom was really the laugh of the day. The sink was probably a 1 1/2 foot by 1 foot size, really small and there was a glass shelf placed below the mirror to hold glass, tissues, etc. Well, trying to brush my teeth and utilize the sink was a chore. Either you bang your head on the glass shelf or stoop over to use the sink. The toilet was crammed between the bathtub and wall. If I was a larger person, I would not have been able to utilize the toilet. The toilet paper roll was directly next to the toilet causing even less room. The shower was hot and that was about the best of the entire room. We stayed because we did not really expect to spend much time in the room anyway. The continental breakfast was a joke. My husband went down to get a light snack for me. The mechanical toaster was broken and you had to manually place the toast or bagel on the rack and watch it carefully to turn with tongs. A 9.99 replacement toster would have done the trick. Not much to choose from, toast, bagel or cereal. And he had to walk down the stairs becuase the elevator was apparently stuck. Well, we did the town, it was a good location and the bed was comfortable. Want to see the Yankees again, will try another place to stay. I recommend not to use room 708.	
Sep 7 2004	A Prime Location	We stayed for five nights in June 2004, encouraged by all the positive reviews the hotel had previously received. We were delighted to find those reviews were very accurate in respect of the excellent value for money, helpfulness of the staff and the close proximity to a lot of the main attractions.As a base for a sightseeing trip, we are sure it will be very hard to beat. Our room was clean and tidy, good sized and, being at the rear of the hotel, very quiet. The buffet breakfast was adequate enough, but we didn't choose it for the cuisine. As a budget hotel we would certainly recommend it to anyone visiting the city for a few days.	
Feb 11 2004	good and bad	the good- Alex at front desk,James the maintainence man,the free breakfast,free coffee.location,cleanliness,fast yes fast elevator-never had to waitthe bad-terrible noisy banging radiators,too much heat,noise if your room faces the street	
May 20 2008 	Location location ...	We spent 5 nights at this hotel from 10-15 May 2008. Excellent location - hotel is small, comfortable (brilliant bed), well refurbished bedroom and bathroom (good shower), very clean, staff friendly, approachable and helpful (especialy Sandip on Reception). Continental breakfast very good (cereals, fruit, yoghurt, juices, tea, coffees, toast, waffles, pastries and gorgeous iced doughnuts!) included in booking. Theatres are a few minutes' walk away, as is ticket booth for shows (half price tickets), Times Sq a minute away yet street is quite quiet. Macys, Rockerfella Centre, 5th Ave all within walking distance. We would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel.	
Aug 23 2006	Great hotel and great location	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown in the middle of July. We had read the reviews posted here and were fairly certain it would be a nice place. Turns out everyone was right! The Comfort Inn is located 1/2 a block from Times Square so the location couldn't be any better. We were right in the middle of the action! Being in the middle of all this you'd expect a lot of noise but our room was perfectly quiet - slamming doors were a little loud as some had mentioned before but not enough to wake us up. The room was small but that was fine with us because who wants to spend a lot of time in the hotel anyway... The room was also very clean and the staff was always extremely nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to experience NY! Also, there's a subway station pretty close so getting around the city is no problem.	
Jul 12 2006	Better than expected	We stayed here from June 10-17, 2006. We had booked a room with a King bed and sofabed in November 2005. Due to the other comments on this site I rang the day I was checking in to be told byu the hotel they do not have king size beds with a sofabed in the same room. This made for a very uncomfortable stay for my husband, our eight year old and me in one bed. My brother-in-law slept in the other bed. We have not yet had an apology from the hotel, although we booked through Choice Hotels. Anyway, we had a room on the twelth floor and had fantastic views of both the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. We walked the stairs most of the time, and it was great to walk the various staircases and to see the old building, including watching the mail go down the chute. Our room was always clean. The breakfast was very good each morning and the location was great for subways and walking.I would stay here again, but you need to ensure you are getting what you pay for.	
Jan 4 2005	Friendly staff 	After reading some of the previous reviews on here and seeing the downloadable brochure picture we were a little worried about what to expect when we got there. First of all, may I just say that the brochure picture doesn't do this hotel justice. The hotel was very clean and tidy. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were adequate in size considering this is New York. And it was in an ideal spot for us as it was in walking distance of Macy's and there were plenty of diners/pubs in walking distance as we fancied more of a fried breakfast as opposed to the free continental breakfast provided. Also nearby to Macy's is a multi-screen cinema called Loews screening all the big named films so we weren't short on things to do at night. As I say, we had an absolutely brilliant stay in NYC and we are hoping to go back again around the same time this year as there is so much more we wanted to see AND we'll be staying here again.	
Aug 31 2009 	Great service great staff perfect location	Overview: I recently booked a stay at this hotel during it's opening week. I am a business traveler and frequently rate hotels. Being that it is a new hotel, I was eager to see what it had to offer.Location: The location is in the heart of the theater district, right off Times Square. Countless famous restaurants and theaters showing the latest hot ticket stage productions are just steps outside of the front door. Getting a taxi or taking the subway is easy any time of day.Checkin: The friendly staff members there were very helpful and accommodating at check-in. I arrived a bit early, but they allowed me to sit in the lobby and use their free wi-fi. Once my room was ready, the check-in process was swift and easy.Getting to Your Room: There is one elevator that transports guests to their rooms. The elevator was clean and moved at a steady pace. There was one incident where the elevator was down, but they worked to quickly remedy the situation the same night.The Room: The room I stayed in was a corner room and it was spacious. The decor was very modern, with a queen sized bed, mounted flatscreen tv on the wall, coffee maker, desk, tall closet/cabinet, iron, ironing board, tall mirror mounted on the wall, and individually controlled AC/Heat, and carpeted floor. The bathroom has a nice shower head with great water pressure and multiple spray settings to give you anything from a massaging shower, to a regular 'rain' shower. There is a tub in the bathroom as well, with smooth tile floors and a granite sink top. The best part is that there is free high speed wi-fi throughout the hotel.Amenities: The lobby has a separate dining area for the free continental breakfast with a flatscreen tv. There is also a computer with an internet connection and printer available for guests to use next to the front desk. The ice machine for all guests is located in the basement.	
May 28 2009 	Just okay	We stayed at the Comfort Inn Time Square for 2 nights in May. When we got to the room the air conditioning was broken (would not turn off) so we were quickly moved to another room. The second room was in good working order. Please note that the rooms are quite small though, even for NY standards. The only reason I mention this is because there was barely any room to put our luggage anywhere! The area also definitely has some &quot;grit&quot; on it. Not as nice as other parts of NY. Location was close to subway lines and attractions though.Only other complaint is that the stairwell gets used a lot in this hotel and since there are only 4 rooms per floor you constantly hear the stairwell door slamming. They offered a continental breakfast which was nice.Room and hotel were just okay.	
Apr 10 2008 	Great Bargain and Location!	We booked a room at the Cosmopolitan after reading all the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. We had two teenage girls and three adults and booked the double queen with sofa bed. What a bargain, we only paid $235 plus tax and loved the location!We were thrilled with our room (#705), it was inside and very quiet. THe room was big enough for five females with lots of luggage to move around freely. It was spotless and the staff was very friendly. There's a Starbucks and great cafe attached to the hotel. We bought the unlimited subway passes and got anywhere in Manhatten in 10-20 minutes. The subways are located right outside the hotel.Canel street and the WTC memorial are a short walk away. Loved staying in this section of town, felt it was more local than midtown. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other visiting New York.Starting in June 2008, the hotel will be non-smoking. However, our room did not smell like smoke at all. The staff kept our luggage on the last day so we could sightsee as our flight was in the evening. Why pay a lot for a room when you are gone from early morning until late at night? Great deal! Thank you TripAdvisor!!	
Jun 20 2007 	Great Location Great Hotel Great Value	If you are looking for a safe, clean, reasonably priced (for New York) hotel for your stay in New York, then I recommend the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The location is perfect...the stop for the 1,2,3 trains (direct to Times Square) is immediately outside your door. City Hall, with its many trains, is only a few blocks away. You are within easy walking distance of the Brooklyn Bridge, the WTC site, Wall Street, and the Staten Island Ferry. The restaurants nearby are fantastic and include Odeon and Bouley (pricey, but worth it). There is also a new cafe next door to the hotel, and it has excellent chocolate croissants (an wonderful way to start your day). My friend and I were both concerned about safety prior to our stay and were pleased to discover this is a great area, well-lit with many people walking around at night. The hotel is basic in its decor and services but includes a decent sized room (we had a two double beds room) that is simply but nicely decorated and absolutely clean, a private bathroom, cable tv, and wireless internet access. Our room was very quiet, but we were not on the street side, so I don't know how quiet those rooms are. I did not mind at all, but should mention that the hallways did smell of cigarette smoke (but our room did not) and the elevator is a bit pokey. If, when you first contact the reservation desk, the nights you wish to stay are booked, keep trying. I called back three times and eventually got a room.	
Sep 10 2007	Friendly reception	The hotel is very convenient to the subway F train, and to times square. Upon arrival, the staff at the reception area were very warm,friendly and welcoming. Although we reserved a king room, only a room with two beds were available, probably because we arrived aroung 6:30pm. But we were put in a king room the following night. Room with the two beds had a small refrigerator, but the king bed room had none. The bathroom door in both room did not stay open, so had to squeeze a small towel under the door to hold it in position. Rooms were clean. Coffee machine in lobby convenient. They should offer breakfast to elite members like the Hilton guest program, but otherwise i would definitely stay here again if the rate is good. Staff at the front made you feel safe by acknowledging those who entered the property.	
Aug 6 2007 	Hotel was a little disappointing	I booked this hotel based upon the reviews on this site. I have travelled to NYC before, but years ago and this time was special with my husband and step-son (10 yo). It was their first time. The location is great...right off Broadway near Times Square. The hotel was smaller than I thought. The reception was great, however, the room they assigned us (1202, I think) was very musty and had black mold-like stuff on popcorn ceiling in bathroom. We immediately requested another room and was offered one for the next night. (Plus, they gave us breakfast vouchers for the inconvenience.) The new room (1701) was better, although I wouldn't consider it above a B- in quality. I think the hotel rooms generally need a make-over. They show several years of wear and tear. The common areas appear to be newer than the rooms.Despite the rooms, I must say that the staff were extremely pleasant and friendly during the whole stay. We enjoyed it in the city and would stay again...but probably at another hotel to try something different.	
Oct 19 2006 	Friendly hotel in good location	We recently stayed 3 nights at the Courtyard Marriott Times Square South. We arrived slightly ahead of check-in but it was no problem for the staff. They were always helpful with a smile on their faces. We even received a late checkout (2pm!) when we asked. The bed was super comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean. The street itself was quiet for being so close to Times Square. The subway was just on the corner and Bryant Park was also nearby as a welcome patch of green in the city. Ate breakfast at the cafe nearby - Harrie's Bakery. All in all, good standard and friendly staff. However, not unique or exciting. Value not great, but about average price for New York weekends!	
Oct 13 2003	Convenient 		
Mar 24 2009 	great weekend stay!	Only stayed for the weekend but, it was a great choice! Arrived in morning, valet took car and we left our stuff in storage until we could check in. Really great location, easy walk to all the sights, banks, etc... When we checked in and got to the room, it was huge and had an amazing view (Corner room) BUT... no sofa bed like we requested. So we called and the front desk was so helpful and fast, we were moved 2 floors down to another room... and it only took them 5 min! The room was very large and clean. The beds were nice and comfy! The elevators were extremely fast (almost too fast!) All and all it was a great stay and i will stay here again in the furture! P.S. --- if you are a AAA member, you will get an amazing rate!!!	
Jan 30 2003	New York on 3rd Avenue		
Feb 17 2009 	WAY Overpriced and too crowded	The only reason I stayed at this hotel as opposed to a less expensive hotel in NYC is because Holiday Inn's Priority Club rewards program is total BS when they say you can use your rewards night points anytime, anywhere. I tried to book every single Holiday Inn brand hotel in NYC during the Christmas shopping season and they told me I couldn't use my rewards points for a free night at any of them because the Christmas season was called a 'special event' and 'special event nights' at hotels can be blocked from people using their rewards nights at a hotel. This was even though the hotels had availability for guests who wanted to pay for the room. When I explained that 'no blackout dates' in their marketing should mean just what it said ... they explained that I wasn't being shut out of a hotel because it was a 'blackout' ... I was being shut out because it was a 'special event'. The 'special event just happened to last every weekend for 2 months. Which is basically the same thing, in my opinion. If a hotel has vacancies that you are not allowed to book using a reward night because a paying guest might want to book the room, that is a black out night.Anyways ... after Priority Club refused to bend on this policy, they asked me if I would like to book a room and pay for it since they would not allow me to use points for the entire month of December. I ended up getting a 'special rate' of $275 for the Crown Plaza because I complained so much. The normal rate was around $450 per night, which is absolute highway robbery. I realize it is Manhatten during the holidays, but still ... I'd get a room with a dinner in the restaurant at the Ritz in Boston during the holiday season for what this hotel charges for a single night. The lobby is huge and crowded with people. You cannot even walk through the lobby without moving between groups of people. Check in took almost a half hour. There were about 8 - 10 check in stations and about 3-4 people actually doing check in.The valet parking was expectedly overpriced for a hotel in this area. I'd say a night's valet charges for a car were about $20 more expensive than some of the non-name brand hotels, like the Wellington. In fact, you would be able to get a hotel in Connecticut and take the train into the city for around the same price of ONLY THE VALET COST for a two night stay at the Crown Plaza in Manhatten.WARNING ... The self park process is VERY confusing at this hotel. I decided to self park the car in the hotel's garage and asked the doorman where the parking garage was. He told me I'd have to go up 3 or 4 streets and make a U-Turn. When I did, I pulled into the parking garage that it seemed he told me about. I asked the attendent if this was the Crown Plaza parking and he said 'Yes. People from the Crown Plaza park here.' When I checked out, I found out that even though this was the closest lot to the hotel and seemed to be the place the doorman had given me directions to, this was not in fact the Crown Plaza's lot. They tried to charge me almost $200 for 2 nights worth of parking. The Crown's lot was one street over. Luckily, it turns out the hotel workers have a special rate set up for that garage since it is closer to the hotel than the actual Crown Plaza parking garage and the hotel manager was actually able to call over and tell them to give me the worker's rate, which was $25 per night, so it worked out ... but cost me about an hour's worth of time.The actual hotel is very big. There is a mix of business travelers and tourists at the hotel. The lobby is very big and has a few seating areas. It is usually very crowded. Elevators are a bit slow because there are so many floors and so many people staying there.The rooms are small ... which for Manhatten is understandable (even at $450 per night.) The decorations in the room were fairly neutral. I seem to remember a lot of yellow and off-white. It didn't really feel great compared to the decor of some of the other hotels. However, unlike a few of the comparable hotels (Sheraton, Marriott, etc.) this is not located right in Times Square, although it is a very short walk to Times Square and a fairly easy walk to Rockafeller Center and Fifth Avenue if you know where you are going. The location is pretty central to the touristy stuff ... if you are planning on doing some of the trendy areas such as Soho or the East Village ... plan on a pretty long cab ride. This hotel is probably more for tourists who want to see Times Square and Broadway.I will agree that the hot water situation is pretty annoying. There are times where you wake up in the morning and will have to take a lukewarm shower because there are so many other floors. The view from the room wasn't great ... it was another very tall building and a crane. I am not sure that any room has a good view as it is kind of in the middle of a few tall buildings.The service is bad ... maybe because it is so crowded. I will agree that most of the people who are working there seem snooty. The front desk person was fairly matter of fact and I didn't feel like anyone went out of their way to welcome me. It almost seemed like I was an annoyance as a guest and there were a few times I had to ask for things several times before anybody did anything about it. The maids were very friendly and most times said hello or greeted us when we saw them in the hallway.I probably wouldn't stay here again. For the price that the room normally cost, it is not worth it. I would rather stay at the Sheraton or Marriott which are right in Times Square and would probably be easier to find with a car ... and the staff probably isn't as rude.On a side note, since my experience with the bogus black out dates ... and having to pay $250 for a room I should have been able to use Priority Club Reward points to get when there was vacancy in the hotel for potential paying customers ... I have cut down on my Holiday Inn stays substantially. I now split my stays between Holiday Inn and Sheraton for business and personal travel because Sheraton doesn't have as many shady exclusions for their free nights, even if it is harder to earn points with Sheraton.	
May 31 2007 	Great location clean and comfortable - loved it!	We stayed for the weekend 18th to 21st May 2007. On arrival, the wait to check in was short and as we were travelling with friends who were booked in a room on the Club Level, the receptionist very kindly upgraded us so we could enjoy the benefits too! We did have to wait an hour for our room to be cleaned, but that was no hardship. All the staff we encountered were polite and friendly.It was our friend's birthday and they called us to their room to help with the plate of cheese and crackers and bottle of wine they found on their return, along with a birthday card from the lovely receptionist - which was a nice suprise!Our room on 46th floor had a great view of the Hudson and was spacious and clean. The bed was about 7 feet wide and very comfortable. We were supposed to have access to a dedicated concierge but we never saw anyone manning the desk. The Club Lounge was a great place to have a drink before venturing out for the night and the continental breakfast was good too.The area around the hotel is busy 24 hours a day, it was reassuring to have our room cards checked every evening before we could access the lifts.We were able to check in online for our return flights in the business centre and as we used the facilities for only 5 mins, this was complimentary.We would definitely stay here again as the location is great and so near theatres and places to eat - we loved the Stage Deli a few blocks up.	
Apr 15 2007 	Staff very unfriendly..!!	From Australia we travelled far to see wonderful NYC. Tired and hungry we were greeted with a very unwelcoming stance by hotel staff. Good location but all facets of hotel room, service, staff and food are not up to standards by all 'hotel means'! Planning another trip '08 definately will NOT stay here!	
Jun 4 2008 	a nice hotel with a nice location	i stayed at this hotel on my first trip to NYC and i was very satisfied with my stay. the Di Vinci is a very clean hotel with a very nice staff (although when we had a question about the best way to travel around the city they didn't have an answer they did call and do some research for us, as i said they are very nice) the room we stayed in was pretty nice but kinda small. although this seemed like a problem at first, but once we realized we were going to spend only time sleeping in the room then it worked perfect. the location of the room was also great, you could walk to Central Park, Time Square and many other locations that were close by. one small problem with the room was with the hot water in the shower, some times it would take a long time for it to warm up, once it did get warm it would get nice and hot but it would just take in a little long. all in all the Di Vinci hotel it a wonderful little hotel at a great price, i would stay there again on my next trip to NYC.	
Jul 31 2009 	Hard to find similar hotel in NYC	I visit NYC every 6 months and have stayed in so many different hotels by now. We booked Doubletree Guest Suites this time to celebrate a birthday and this hotel just beats them all! Having so much space in a hotel room in New York is a rare sight. Service was excellent. The location is unbeatable. Can't wait to go back.	
Jul 7 2008 	Too Many Problems to Stay Again	The positives of this hotel are the location and the beds. It is very close to a subway, very close to walk to great tourist and shopping areas, it is easy to get to almost any spot from the hotel. The beds are very good and the pillows are great. The room is a little small for more than 2 people but was adequate for us. The bathroom is newly remodeled and while small, very nice. Another positive was the doorman at 5am. He could not have been any nicer or more helpful.The negatives: Maybe too many to write all. I booked and paid for the hotel about a month in advance. I asked for an upper floor with a view, got the fourth floor with a view of a wall and air conditioning unit. Called and asked for different room and was told all Lexington Ave rooms were private apartments and nothing else was available. We were not able to check in at 1pm and had to place our bags in &quot;storage&quot; for a $1.00 per bag. Since we were going to walk around we placed backpack and large overnight bag so the total was $6.00. Imagine our shock when we came back in and had to pay another $6.00 to get them out of the closet. Not a bellboy bringing them to our room, but us walking into the closet and getting them. Just the beginning of the nickel and dime charges we experienced during our visit. We were not offered cookies and someone wrote about free bottled water, well, we were not offered anything that was free.I had asked when I made my reservations if there was a fridge in the room to place insulin and was told yes. There is a fridge but it is so full of items that 2 vials of insulin kept knocking a beer off to the side and were charged $6.00 numerous times. I asked if we could have someone take out the items and leave the fridge for us to use and was told no, but if an empty fridge became available, they would bring it up for a charge. They did take off the charges of the beer when we checked out (sort of).My daughter had arrived before I did and she put up a credit card for incidentals. Four days after checkout her credit card was still holding $180 pending charges. $50 a day plus the mini bar charges I was told would be taken off. They took the items off when we called to ask about the pending charges and they said the $50 a day incidental charge would come off the next day. Wow, holding this money for 5 days is really not acceptable to me.You have to pay for Internet access to the amount of $13.00 a day which is very unusual these days. I cannot think of anything that came as complimentary. I would really check around before staying here again and figure in the price of the things that are usually free at other hotels. I think this hotel was about $20 a night cheaper than the other 2 in the area and with the extra charges probably came out to be about $15 a night more expensive. The concierge was VERY rude and quite insulting when I asked for a map of the area. I suppose because I was not booking anything through them, he assumed it was ok to be rude. Once again, not what I was expecting. We were going to see if we could book a play through them and then decided we would plan everything else ourself so as to not be in a position to tip these horrid people. Overall it was not a good experience--except the location is great but there are other hotels in the exact area. We will try them next time.	
Dec 25 2007 	It was great!	At check in the staff were very nice and offered us a free upgrade of our room, the warm chocolate cookies were delicious!!!! :)The bellman who helped us to our room was kind and helpful.The doorman offered us a pleasant smile everytime we came in or left the hotel. This vacation was a dream come true for us and the Doubletree made it even more special.	
Nov 7 2007 	Loved it in spite of reviews	My parents booked this hotel for my birthday gift for my husband and I. We stayed for 2 nights. When I found out about the trip (in advance so I could get the time off) I went to tripadvisor to check out the hotel. I was quite worried by the reviews, but figured I love NYC, and loved the location of the hotel so would get by.I loved the hotel. I'm not into that super modern stuff, but the lights didn't annoy me like I thought they would. We were in the smallest room they have, but I thought it was fine, it had some wasted space in an empty corner that we could keep our suitcases in (with room to spare). The bed is amazenly comfortable, just great. The bathroom was small, and there was no place to hang your towels, so I could never reuse them. But they would leave us fresh ones, so no problem. Also our safe broke and went into a lock down about 30 minutes before we had to leave for our play, with our tickets in it! I was in a complete panic, and neither of us was ready or dressed. The hotel staff was great in helping us, they sent someone immediately. When he couldn't get it fixed, they got someone else that said they had to take the safe to drill it. When they did they returned it before opening so we could account that nothing was taken. And this took 20 minutes! We made it to the play with tickets, hair done and dressed. I was quite pleased with this service.My parents thought we would like the rooftop bar. Boy were they wrong, that I thought was a waste. It wasn't outdoors, just a tiny room, with way to loud music and no room. Just very small. So I wouldn't recommend the bar.I would be willing to stay here again, and definitely couldn't beat the price they got for the location. I have noticed the price has been much higher than the booking though, so it must have been a special expedia deal my mom found.	
Mar 14 2006	Distinctly average	I found the hotel distinctly average. The blue neon lighting and the dimly lit hallways were bordering on seedy. When they describe the rooms as small they mean 'SMALL'. The location however was excellent. Note if staying on the 13th floor over the weekend you need to be aware that the 14th floor houses the hotel night club and any references to this fact will fall on deaf ears when discussing with the hotel staff, you will just have to lump it !!	
Jun 9 2009 	Bad service all around	There was bad service throughout the stay at the Dylan Hotel. We had a room with no water pressure and no hot water. We called the front desk staff about this and on the second day of our stay they had engineers etc working in our room trying to fix the problem. They did not provide us with a different room, but rather had strangers working in our room during our &quot;romantic&quot; stay in NY. Finally by the end of the second day we finally had water in our room. When we were leaving, the valet had lost our car key. They finally found it but my boyfriend noticed that they had taken off and not returned the car antennae. We sat there waiting for them to find the antennae and, after about a one hour delay from the time we checked out, we were finally on our way. Worst hotel experience ever. I contacted the hotel manager about the hotel room experience but heard nothing back. Clearly this hotel does not care about customer opinions.So to recap: Horrible service throughout the entire stay, bad management, and just a very bad hotel in general. ABSOLUTELY do not recommend this hotel.	
Dec 4 2007 	Not impressed	After reading many reviews we finally chose Eastgate Tower Hotel for our 5 night stay in New York. Our only request was a room with a view, which ended up being a room on the second floor, right above the air conditioning unit, which hummed continuously looking at a rather dull rendered wall. Not being a well travelled person I was expecting a little luxury for our $2300 stay, how wrong I was! The room was in desperate need of redecoration and very grubby, there were stale crackers in the kitchen cupboards and the windows did not shut tightly which mean't the humming was more audible. The restaurant was also closed for referbishment, which was never mentioned on their website or when they took our hard earned cash!If you have decided to stay at this hotel, judging by the reviews you might be lucky, but if you get room 2D you won't be impressed.	
May 8 2007 	Good time at Eastgate	I took my 12-year old daughter and 13-year old niece to NYC for the weekend. We took the subway from JFK to the hotel which was interesting (only $2 each from JFK to Howard Beach to 42nd Street to Grand Central--5 minute walk from there to the hotel--JFK $5 connection was free that day for some reason). Cab ride would've been a $45 flat rate.Our first experience at the Hotel wasn't good...the front desk personwouldn't provide our room at 1:00 pm as it &quot;wasn't ready&quot;. The bellman overheard and volunteered to check the room himself. I think he saw that I had planned to have the girls nap (had been up since 4:00 am) right on the lobby couches until the room was ready and smartly offered to get us in. Not sure why the front desk didn't check to see, but it helps to be persistent. Room was already made up and available. Housekeeping was then great with quickly providing extra linens and towels. The room was very large. We had a &quot;1 bed suite&quot; ($270 first night, $215 second night). It wasn't really a suite with a door to the bedroom, but it had a sitting area as well as a table with 4 chairs. Kitchen was adequate--just used the refrigerator and freezer. Furniture was a bit worn and dated. Blankets provided for the pull-out couch were filled with holes. Bathroom was tiny and not as clean as it could've been. The hairdryerwas especially dirty, and there were several cracks in the mirror andtile. Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet on the 10th floor. The heat didn't seem to work very well, but we were still comfortable. We didn't spend much time in the hotel, so we weren't that fussy. We felt very safe. I had stayed at the Affinia Dumont also in the Murray Hill neighborhood--which was a much more upscale property but a further walk to Grand Central Station. However, prices there have increased significantly. I was very happy with the room and with our stay at Eastgate. The bellman arranged a town car for us back to JFK for a $50 flat rate. Nice driver; enjoyed much better than a cab ride. Kids loved it!The location of this hotel is great--walked to Grand Central Station,Empire State Building, all the great restaurants on 3rd Avenue, TimesSquare, Bryant Park, and even to Rockefeller Centre. Only took 3 cab rides in 3 days. The Gray Line double-decker bus tours are outstanding. You can get on and off at various parts throughout the city (buy tickets online for a $5 savings). Guides are very entertaining. You can start at Times Square and go from there. The girls loved the city, especially the tour of NBC. Our only regrets were not making it out to the Statue of Liberty and wasting time going up to the top of the Empire State Building--too long of a line and the girls were quickly bored. I recommend this hotel for families with kids. Great neighborhood, close to everything, very safe.	
May 6 2007 	Quality in NYC!	Stayed in the Eastgate for 2 weeks while my apartment was renovated and my experience was wonderful. I booked a full studio suite with living room, and it was clean, up to date and spacious. The Kitchen, which I only used for the freezer, fridge, and microwave, was awesome! it was like living in my apartment, but with maid service. The staff was wonderful and accomodated my requests.Only downside is the cost of internet service, $10 a day or $40ish dollars a week, for what I paid it should be an included amenity, imo.There are restaurants, bars, and stores conveniently located to the hotel, all are pretty good. Also, don't bother taking a cab, just walk to Grand Central (and visit the market!).	
Jun 5 2008 	Ottimo		
Nov 15 2004	Roomy stylish friendly... and a bargain!	First off, I'm a tough judge of hotel rooms. I don't give 5* out like halloween candy, pal. That said, this hotel so far exceeded my expectations, that I can't help yap its praises. Here goes: the lobby/ hallways are stylish and bright, kind of arty modern. All staff that I had contact with were helpful and friendly, the maid service was prompt each morning and the room was in perfect order when I returned from the complimentary breakfast, and what a breakfast! (at the bar: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, yogurt, fruit, bagels, croisants, toast. at the grill: made-to-order waffles, pancakes, omlettes, eggs). Room was huge! Seemed more like an apartment than a room-- had a living room (sofa/ dining table/ TV/ coffee table), large, spotless bathroom (great water pressure), hall, and bedroom. Big comfy bed. Ample storage for my clothes (plus iron/ hairdryer/ coffee/ 2 TVs/ alarm clock) Nice art on the walls. For $20 extra per night (well worth it!), got a great view of the Hudson River and (if I craned my neck south) the Statue of Liberty! (Tip: ask for the room upgrade in advance when you confirm, as they can sell out of river views). Was never around for it, but from 5:30-7:30 you get free drinks (yes, plural, not just one!) at the hotel lounge. And the best part... got a steal through priceline for $150 a night! This is now my NYC hotel. I ain't ever hangin' my hat anywheres else, bub.	
Nov 23 2009 	Best Bagels	I have stayed in this hotel last week 11/13, and they had the best mini bagels I have ever tasted!	
Dec 20 2007	Would Never Go Back	This hotel recently re-opened and my wife and I found it online. We've been to NYC many times and have stayed in a lot of the top-tier hotels. While this hotel clearly isn't top tier (ie Four Seasons), it was disappointing even for what it advertises itself to be. The rooms are extremely small and have been redesigned but with very cheap items (it took 3 calls to the front desk to fix broken lights in our room). However, the service was by far the worst aspect of our stay. Our room was not ready at the check in time the hotel staff acted like they were doing us a favor by actually getting us to our room. Most of the staff were pretty rude and not helpful. We ordered room service once and the food was cold and took over an hour to arrive. The only good thing about this hotel is the location but you can do far better for the same price. Don't stay here if you can avoid it.	
Sep 27 2007 	Excellent Hotel and Staff		
Dec 13 2008 	Great get Away	Wellrun hotel with good desk service. Comfy room and good ensuite facilities. Easy access to Metro and Central Park. Service to keep bags after check-out for those late flights gives another bag free walk about day.	
Oct 14 2008	More than accomodating.	I had origially booked one night. Plans changed and I needed three nights. There were only suites available for the middle night so I ended up having to make three separate reservations. When I arrived I asked if we could be in the same room all three nights. I even said we would be willing to stay in a regular room and pay for the suite the middle night. They more than graciously put us in a suite for all three nights. They were in a great location ( across the street from The Museum of Natural History). There were great restaurants closeby and the subway was across the street as well.	
Oct 14 2007 	Loved it!	Excellent hotel! extremely clean with a beautiful view of the American Museum of Natural History.An excellent choise for those who want to stay at Upper West Side.	
Jul 6 2007 	Location location location	After all the reviews, we took the plunge and stayed at the Excelsior. The staff was aloof, borderline snobbish and not overly helpful, but if you understand that you are in New York, you can get over it. Half were nice, half were marginal. It's just the way it is. The room is VERY clean and VERY spacious by New York standards, very nicely decorated. This is an upscale hotel at a more than decent price in the city. You won't be disappointed. However, this is not the place for small children. THERE ARE NO LOCKS ON THE WINDOWS!!! Literally, anyone could fall right out of the 12th fl., no guards, nada! We strategically placed our luggage, and the kids were so doggone tired, they wouldn't think to get up at night, and we weren't in the room daytime. Airconditioner is so, so. You CANNOT beat the location!!!! The Museum of Natural His. and Central Park, literally ACROSS the street. Subway, outside the door! Would stay again, because of location! Overall very good value! Walk to Funky Diner to eat, food is EXCELLENT and they are friendly there! Taxi is $10 one way to heart of Times Sq., but its nice to stay away from the hustle.	
Sep 15 2004 	Excelsior-great find in NYC	Booked the Excelsior for a 3-day business trip this week, thanks to numerous recommendations from friends, and because of its location. I will cast my vote with the positive reviews here; I had a great experience. I was greeted by friendly, smiling faces, check-in was very smooth, they upgraded my room to a junior suite (unasked, and did not even draw it to my attention or make a big deal out of it, I just discovered it when I opened the door). The rooms were clean, well-decorated, traditional, European in atmosphere. As said elsewhere in these reviews, the bed is absolutely divine. Since NYC is only a 2-1/2 hr train ride away, I usually come into the City just for the day, but now that I've found a great place to stay, I will definitely plan on an overnight getaway with my husband in the very near future!	
Apr 14 2004	Ghastly	Recommended this hotel to friends of mine who came to visit. We were greated by a very nice asian woman, but that was about it. A so called &quot;front desk supervisor&quot; actually asked if they could wait one minute and she proceeded to answer her cell phone and speak to whomever it was. I thought this was sopposed to be a professional work environment but it is soo laid back and mismanaged. I mean how can you hire a supervisor that does that?Now their creature problem. They have roaches, which I can understand with all the restaurants around this area, I am not a moron I do know that this pesky creatures are annoying, but my god, they have their front desk staff jumping on counters to get away from these bugs, not to say I wouldn't do the same but sheesh look what even the the staff has to put up with. We even saw a mouse in the breakfast room.Another time my friends came and they stayed there and left with bug bites all over his arms. Now this was the end of winter so I highly doubt the mosquitos were out...so what pray tell bit him all over his arm causing him to bleed and be left with red bumps? When he confronted the desk he met a nice woman who was very appologetic, she offered him the manager's business card. Later when they checked out they noticed they were still being charged for the late check out considering what he went through but the same desk agent still appologetic informed them that she had spoke with the manager and on his orders was to still charge them. They contacted the manager who refused to reimburse them for any part of their stay.How atroucious...just ghastly...if you would like to walk away with all the blood in your body that you came with please SAVE YOURSELF, do not stay here.	
Jan 6 2004	Excelsior excels!!	We just returned from five days and four nights (12-26-30-2003) at the Excelsior and we would highly recommend the hotel. After reading some of the reviews on this site I was a bit concerned but we had NONE of the bad service that others experienced. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Requests for things like extra towels and blankets were responded to within five minutes. The hotel was very clean, the rooms beautiful in a French motif and the location on 81st and Central Park West was perfect. Half a block to Central Park, subway station or Museum of Natural History. 15 min stroll to the Metropolitan museum of Art. Fantastic family oriented restaurants!! I am sorry that others had a bad experience, perhaps all those folks were fired because the current group of people from the front desk to the concierge to the bellman were all great. Please dont hesitate to stay here.	
Apr 17 2009 	great value	This is a brand new hotel near Time Square conveniently located. Subway station is 2 minutes away and the Theater District is within walking distance. The street it is on looks worrisome but was safe to walk around even at night. It is a great value for the closeness to Time Square but if you want to stay in more &quot;in&quot; street, then you'd need to pay more. We'd go back again. Free breakfast was quite convenient to start the day.	
Oct 8 2009 	Enjoy a touch of Ireland in the city that never sleeps!	Our recent stay at the Fitzpatrick Grand Centra Hotell in New York city was simply delightful! Having recently returned from my 3rd trip to Ireland, I was hoping my selection of this Irish hotel would be reminiscent of the charm and good will I experienced on each of my Irish adventures. I was not disapppointed!! From the moment we arrived in the lobby we were met with friendly service and a beautiful, comfortable home away from home. Our room was very clean, quiet, updated and had wonderful amenities. Following busy days touring the city, the pub and its courtyard were a welcome retreat. Even the guests, many of whom were from Ireland, were extremely warm and friendly. We just can't wait to go back---we've even been invited to visit some of our newly made Irish friends!	
Aug 21 2007	Nice Hotel Great Location	Myself and my fiancé stayed in this hotel for three nights in August 2007. We booked the hotel through a travel agent and got better rates than the hotel was offering through its website. We found the staff at the hotel to be very friendly and helpful. When we arrived the porter helped us with our luggage to our room, gave us maps of New York and discount vouchers for some tourist attractions. The room itself was nice for a city centre hotel. The room and bathroom was clean and our towels were changed daily. The hotel is very well situated in the centre of Manhattan and everything in Midtown Manhattan is within walking distance of about ten to twenty minutes such as the Empire State Building, Macys, 5th Avenue, Central Park, Times Square and Madison Square Gardens. The day we checked out, the porters stored our luggage for us as we had a late flight and booked us a cab to the airport when we were leaving. Overall we were very happy with our stay at the Fitzpatrick Hotel at Grand Central Station and would stay there again once the price remains reasonable.	
Jun 21 2009 	never again!	we had booked a 3 room suite which turned out to be a 2 room suite and much smaller than advertised.The bathtub/shower did not work. completely clogged and although we complained at least twice daily they NEVER managed in the 8 days to fix it. The room was dirty with old hair lying in sink, blood on toilet, crumps in kitchen and it remained dirty. We complained a lot and finally they opened up the room next door for us to use as well.However, they later billed us that is they didn't bill us but when we returned home we found out they had charged us for the extra room but as though it was a second suite. We ended up paying for 2 suites. We complained and they just ignored us. We went in to the City to talk to Manager who said they would solve it but they just ignored us. We never signed for them to charge this excess amount and we never agreed to paying for 2 suites we never got. And we certainly would rather have expected a discount for dirty rooms, not functioning bathrooms etc. Also, aircon didn't work. But then again NOTHING worked.The management was as rude and indifferent as the rest of the staff.Finally we had to involve our credit card company and make a case. Luckily, our credit card company sided with us and we got our money back after 6 months, but without interest!Flatotel is run by a bunch of dishonest crooks and the rooms are way smaller than advertised not to mention unliveable disgusting.	
Feb 13 2009 	terrible experience at this hotel!	my colleague and i shared a room at the sheraton four points chelsea a few weeks ago while on a business trip, and had a very bad experience with an extremely disappointing lack of response from management. we would not recommend this hotel and like to see management respond to our request for an apology and a refund on our room.during our trip, at 4 IN THE MORNING, a male (we are female) opened the door to our room with a card key. i woke up and said, &quot;who's there? how did you get into our room?&quot; the person said, &quot;i have a key&quot; and started stumbling around our room. i shouted, &quot;get out! how did you get in here, get out!&quot; while my colleague also woke up. we repeated, &quot;get out! get out!&quot;the guy looked around, said, &quot;i have a key!&quot; dropped a bunch of stuff, and ran out. after turning on the light we saw when he stumbled, he scattered a bizarre assortment of disgusting food - ice cream, shredded mozzarella cheese, a half eaten sandwich, a partially eaten muffin etc - all over our floor and there was a trail of it going out into the hallway.we called the front desk to get help, who said they'd call security to check the halls for the intruder and would keep us posted. after 10 minutes and no word so we called back down. the front desk said, &quot;oh we didn't see anyone&quot;. !!we asked them to send someone up. they sent up the lobby security person up and we described what happened. as you can imagine when 2 women are staying in a room and a man opens the door with a key at 4am, we were concerned for our safety, in addition to being frustrated because we had a really important meeting at 9am and this was a big disturbance to our sleep. the security guard said, &quot;i think i know what happened. the restaurant guy downstairs sometimes stays here if we have a late party. there was a late party downstairs so maybe they gave him the key to your room by mistake.&quot; we told him we wanted to talk to the manager, we didn't understand how such a mistake could be made - and that we'd like help cleaning up the drunk guy's food mess. well, no one came to clean up the drunk food, so we were on our hands and knees scooping it up at 5am. and we tracked down the night front desk guy who explained: the restaurant guy sometimes stays in the hotel, sometimes in the room we were staying in. at 4am, he was drunk from the party, and he asked for a key at the front desk, insisting for the key to our room. the night front desk guy looked at the computer and told him it looked like there were guests in that room. the drunk guy said no, that's my room. and so the night desk guy gave him the key to our room!! we asked to talk to the manager in the morning.we were later able to talk to the manager after calling him repeatedly. he said he'd &quot;see what he could do.&quot; well, they billed us for our room and told us &quot;it would be hard for accounting to undo the charge.&quot; right! the manager said he'd follow up with another solution, but hasn't. it's a month later, and we're still spooked by our experience. why would you give a drunk male a key to a room known to have female guests in it at 4am? what if the drunk guy had assaulted us? we are lucky he stumbled out instead of something much more serious happening. shouldn't there be some acknowledgment by the hotel of this frightening and preventable disruption to our trip, rather then them trying to ignore us? i don't get it.this hotel needs to relook at their management team. for a business traveler, what's requisite at a minimum when considering a hotel are safety, and a good night's sleep. we did not get either at this hotel, nor a modicum of appropriate customer service following this mess up.	
Jun 30 2008 	Stylish and efficient Chelsea hotel but avoid the breakfast	We stayed here for three nights in early June. It was an easy walk from Penn Station. Our 16th floor room with two double beds was reasonably sized for NYC and had an efficient layout. There was a nice view of the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The amenities and styling were splendid for this level of hotel. The free Wi-Fi worked well. Note that some floors have a fairly loud ice machine and it is located about 4 inches from someones door (happily, not on our floor). We had some vouchers for a continental breakfast or fruit plate one day and one of us upgraded to the waffles. Big mistake as they were straight from the freezer (and the price was $14!). The fruit plate had some good pineapple and raspberries, but the cantaloupe was completely inedible (unacceptable for a $9 item). We recommend that you just walk over to the Garden of Eden market on 23rd St. between 6th and 7th Avenues and get some really delicious fruit and bagels for a lot less. There were several subway stations nearby. One caution: the hotel is on the edges of the newly trendy Chelsea. East of 6th Avenue, the neighborhood gets quite a bit rougher.	
Jan 22 2008 	Good Hotel Decent Location	We booked this hotel as a Starwood reward night. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because of the location which is convenient to restauarants and are galleries in Chelsea.The staff was very nice and helpful. We stayed on a Saturday, and there were not any protestors while we were there.Yes, the rooms are small, however this is common for Manhattan. The decor was modern, and the room and bathroom were clean. One complaint about the bathroom is that there is very little room for your personal belonings. Another or different shelf would probably help. The view wasn't great but not expected for that part of the city.The machines in the workout room need some maintenance as both treadmills were not working properly. It is very easy to walk to restaurants and Chelsea art galleries. To get a taxi just walk down to 7th Avenue, and there is a Whole Foods right on the corner. Although breakfast was free, it took an extremely long time to get service and get our food. The staff was very friendly, however, and did what they could to make the experience better. They were severly understaffed which may be attributed to the strike. Overall it is a good hotel in a good location.	
Aug 13 2006 	Ideal Location Quiet and Comfortable	We stayed here in June, having booked it through the Sheraton website as we are SPG members. Yes, the rooms are small but what do you expect in NYC! The rooms have all the amenities you need and the heavenly bed which is worth the admission fee alone. A fridge would have been useful but there is ice available. The one thing that struck us about the room (we were on the 14th floor) is how quiet it is. Despite being in a busy area of Manhattan is was really quiet so a good night's sleep was ensured.The staff were very friendly and always helpful although we were out most of the day exploring.For breakfast, we checked out the cafe recommended by others on the site but it was 95 degrees so we didn't fancy many hot omelettes. We can recommend the Whole Foods Market just round the corner on 7th Avenue which has an amazing array of hot and cold food for breakfast and lunch. There's another one at the bottom right-hand corner of Central Park as well - great for picnics.For dinner, The Salaam Bombay (Greenwich Street, Lower Manhattan) was fantastic and for Italian, go for Pelegrino's in LIttle Italy which is a little pricier but fantastic food and service. Some of the other places in Little Italy offer below-average food and way-above-average prices.One tip - if you're flying back from JFK allow at least an hour from the hotel because the traffic can be really bad.Great hotel - would definitely go back if we revisit NYC - reasonable rate, clean rooms, friendly staff and very quiet!	
Oct 20 2005	Great Bang for the Buck	This hotel is awesome. Everything in there looks brand new. And it is in a great location. I've read some reviews about small rooms but you really can't complain when it is in New York City. All the hotels in New York City are going to be a bit smaller than your hotels in different states. I've stayed at many different places but none of them can beat the quality of this hotel and none of them can offer it for the same prices.	
Jun 9 2009 	Great staff and location. Small rooms but clean and new	The staff here is exceptional. Went out of their way for us. Brought extra towels right away and helped a friend who was feeling ill. Good location, not too far from SoHo and a ten minute walk to Grenich or Tribeca. Rooms and bathroom are small, but they are clean and modern.	
Jan 7 2009	PERFECT!	Just got back from a great stay here. I was in NYC for New Years with two friends. We met up from different parts of the country and wanted to be somewhere fun for New Years, but not in the crazy midtown area. This turned out to be perfect. It was easy enough to grab a cab to head uptown to tour around, and a short stroll to the SoHo and Village areas... even an easy walk to check out Canal Street, Chinatown, ect. Tons of restaurants, delis, bars, shops, and everything nearby. Being very unfamiliar with Manhattan I was hesitant on booking this hotel since it is not in the typical tourist area, but once we got there and walked a couple blocks we were SO HAPPY with the choice. To make it better the staff was the nicest staff I've ever experienced. They were happy to help us with any questions we had. And along with suggestions, we got walking maps and directions to suit our needs. They made the stay amazing! And since it is hard to adjust the first day, a good destination to grab lunch or a drink is always helpful. The only difficult part was the size of the room, which I am assuming is normal for Manhattan, it is just a little small for three 20-some year old girls. Clothes and shoes were EVERYWHERE!I want to be back there!	
Jan 3 2009 	close to lots of shopping	After spending 2 nights in midtown to see the New Years Eve festivities, we were happy to retreat to SOHO.The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient. We have no complaints - this is a basic, clean, comfortable and well designed hotel. It is very close to the subway station (train 1 - Houston St).The location is 2 blocks away from tons of shopping - from upscale designers to the Canal St craziness. We walked from the hotel through SOHO, Little Italy and the West Village in FREEZING temps. We would stay there again - in fact - we would like to have more time in this area to really explore it.	
Jan 11 2005	Luxurious Wonderful Stay	Spent 3 nights at the Four Seasons New York in Jan 05 and it was an amazing experience. From the moment we stepped into the lobby, we knew it was going to be a great stay. We booked the Bed and Breakfast package. Upon arrival, we were upgraded from a Moderate to a Superior room. You can either enjoy the breakfast in your room or in the restaurant. The room is very big for NY. The bathroom was beautiful and the tub does fill in 60 seconds. Loved the Bulgari bath products. We have stayed in other FS properties such as Hualalai and Santa Barbara and have never been disappointed. If you are looking for a luxurious hotel, this is the place for you. A great location if you like shopping on Madison and 5th Ave. The museums are also very close.	
Jul 31 2009 	Gramercy Park Hotel is in a wonderful location	*Rooftop garden is beautiful and is fun for people watching*Servers at Rooftop garden very friendly*Drinks are very expensive*Room was cleaned daily*Bed was wonderful *Room was very dark*Hotel lobby very dark*A different experience*Area around hotel was wonderful and quiet*Room service not always prompt*Menu prices too expensive*Not sure that I would return*Gramercy Park next door was a real treat*If you want to spend that kind of money go for it	
Jul 25 2009 	Could be so much better!	This was our fourth time staying at this hotel and we chose it mainly because of it's convenient location (next to Grand Central Terminal). We usually stay for 2 weeks on each visit but this year my husband was there for 5 weeks on business. The room was unusually small and bathroom sink was tiny. The last couple of visits the rooms have been small but this one couldn't even accommodate a chair in the room. It was right next to the bed so no walking by space.The rooms do not come with a coffee maker so we brought ours from home. We had inquired earlier if a coffee maker could be provided in our room but we were told that we would have to check with Housekeeping when we arrived but they could not promise we would have one as it first come first serve basis. I feel they could be more accommodating to people who are staying longer and paying a very expensive room rate and/or arriving later in the day. No discounts or reductions given here in the room rate for a longer stay. The rate we paid did include one business shirt to be laundered every day as their website offered but after the second day the laundered shirt would be returned with a $15 invoice attached to it. When I called down to the desk the guy told me it was only one shirt laundered 'per visit'. My husband had to print out their website the next day at work to show the front desk. The desk agreed after seeing the ad that we were correct. However, Housekeeping kept including an invoice on the laundered shirt when it returned to our room. I went to the desk and they told me that the charge would not appeared on our bill upon check out. Indeed, we were not charged. Somehow you think they could come up with a better method so not to confuse their hotel guests.  The walls in the room are thin and you can hear all the conversations in the next room. If you are a light sleeper this may be a problem. The one thing I can rave about is their breakfast buffet is excellent. It's very expensive and there is no menu- I think it was $28 per person? so you have to be very hungry to enjoy the buffet (fresh fruit, eggs made to order, waffles, bacon, sausages, incredible pastries, fresh squeezed orange juice, etc.). Otherwise, they do have a coffee stand that sells muffins, bagels &amp; salads but it was a bit annoying that you couldn't order from a menu. I overheard a few other guests not happy about the discovery when entering the restaurant.The hotel is in a great location but I think the next time we are in NYC we will be looking at other hotels to stay at.	
Jan 24 2009 	great location !	The location of this hotel is fantastic. It's just a few meters from Grand Central Terminal. Price is not so good, but this is NYC !The room is small, but well decorated and clean; comfortable beds/pillows.Hotel charges for wireless Internet access in the room.	
	Nice Hotel Great Location	Our room was clean, and nicely appointed. Small, but to be expected given the location. VERY comfortable beds. Staff were friendly and responsive.	
May 30 2009 	Great base for shopping trip	We stayed here for 3 nights and were very impressed. The rooms whilst not massive are a decent size for Manhattan. The hotel is only a couple of years old and has been well maintained and I did not notice anything untidy or in even slight disrepair during our stay. The bed was extremely comfortable, the furnishings stylish and the room well equiped. The facilities in the rooms include a flat screen TV, blackout blinds, an iron and board, a hairdryer, phone, bath and shower and air-conditioning. This hotel only has a 3 star rating, but I would say the rooms are more like you would find in a good 4 star. There is a bar, a restaurant (serving breakfast only), a fitness centre, a business centre with two PCs and free internet access, ice machines, free wifi, room service and a 24 hour reception. The staff were very pleasant and helpful although we didn't have a need for their assisstance other than to order us a taxi to the airport. There is a luggage storage area, within which the concierge will arrange to store your bags on your departure day. The hotel is centrally located and a great base if you plan to walk around Manhattan, although there are also three subway stations within less than a five minute walk, which are served the1,2,3,4,5,6, N, R, Q and W lines. The Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, Macys, Chelsea Park, Madison Sqaure Park, the Flatiron Building and Fith Avenue are all also within a less than five minue walk of the hotel. The street is not the prettiest although I consider this is to be expected of most locations in midtown if you are not staying on the Avenues. The flower market operated on all but one of the days of our stay and improved the appearance of our surroundings greatly. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York and it was perfect for our trip.	
Oct 8 2009 	Excellent	We stayed here for 4 nights in August, based on reviews found on Trip Advisor. This hotel was PERFECT. We got a great rate ($145/night) through Hilton's website and were so pleased with the hotel. The rooms are small but clean and new, the location is great, and all was beyond what we expected. i am a very picky person and I was so pleased! Check in and check out were easy, the left-luggage service was very helpful. We were on the 14th floor, and were amazed at how quiet the room was--no noise from the street or hallway. If you are looking for someplace safe, clean, nice, well-located (subway stop literally at the end of the block)--stay here.The only issue (and it was very minor) was that the adjustable bed wasnt workingbut it was still comfortable, just a bit firm.	
Nov 22 2009	Excellent hotel for NYC	This hotel is nothing fancy, but is does everything you need it to do. It is clean, the AC works fine in the summer, location really close to Times Square (if that's what you want), the rooms are fine. This was my second stay at this hotel. The lobby is quite small, and can be a little crowded at times. But for the cost (compared to other hotels) it is just great.	
Oct 14 2009 	Great Hotel Excellent Location	Another HGI winner. I flew red eye and was able to check in early (11:00am) with no problem. The hotel staff is professional and efficient. The location is great, right next to the subway stations. They also post a security guard at night to make sure only hotel guests can access the elevators.	
Sep 20 2009 	Gem of a Hotel Great Location	Straight off the bat, for those who get impatient reading reviews, this is a really great hotel and Id recommend it to anybody. I stayed here for 5 nights last week and enjoyed every minute of it. The staff in the hotel are some of the friendliest and most helpful Ive come across. Checking is was a doddle and the hotel even checked us in early without any bother. Check out was also very straightforward.RoomsIve stayed in NYC hotels before and the rooms are generally very very small, but my room (Rm 321, 2 very comfy Queen Beds) was quite spacious by NY standards. The room included a proper fridge, microwave, 37 LCD TV, coffee making facilities and free Wi-Fi. The air-con was very good too. The bathroom is smallish but well appointed and with a good hot powershower. Bathroom towels etc were good quality and the complimentary shampoo, conditioner, body cleanser etc is nice Neutrogena.LocationThe Hilton Garden Inn is located on 8th Ave and is about 2 Blocks away from 50th Street Subway which goes north to Central Park and South all the way to Ground Zero. I found it very handy for getting around. The Hotel is also less than 5 minutes walk from the main Broadway Theatres if you plan on catching a show e.g. Phantom of the Opera at The Majestic Theatre, its about 3 mins away. You can walk to Times Square in 5 mins also and there are a number of nice restaurants nearby. If youre hungry, theres a Food Emporium 1 Block to the north which has lovely salads, deli, freshly made sushi, confectionary, pretty much all the nice food youll ever want. You can either take it away or sit in by the window and watch 8th Avenue go by!Overall I found this hotel to be immaculate, ideally located for my tourist needs, very good value and the staff friendly, helpful and professional. I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend it to my family and friends. Dont take an age searching for other hotels in NYC. Trust me, this ones worth it!	
Jul 30 2009 	Crowded shabby worst Hilton ever stayed in	Shabby room. Excessively loud air conditioning. Very mediocre service.	
Dec 8 2007 	Good location 	Stayed at this hotel for three evenings during the week of December 3. It was one of the lower priced hotels available in the Times Square area (the closest competitor price-wise was the Paramount, and given the TripAdvisor reviews for that hotel, I chose not to stay there!).The good:- Free highspeed (wired) in the rooms, wireless in the lobby- Free bottles of water (for Hilton Hhonors members)- Location- Lots of nearby restaurants- Reasonable sized mini-fridge, reasonably new microwave, and LCD TV (although with only an SD signal an old TV would have been fine)The bad:- Street noise is bad, but being on the 6th floor, I heard almost nothing after 10 PM- Cost, although that is true of all hotels in the area- The bathroom paint (especially the door) needed to be redone (see photos)If I had to stay within walking distance of Times Square, I'd stay here again...	
Dec 6 2008 	A horrible experience...never coming back	We stayed at the Hilton New York for five nights this month, in December 2008, and regret ever choosing to stay at this miserable hotel. There were more serious problems than there is enough space to recount. I have stayed at many Hilton properties all over the world and across the USA. The Hilton New York is by far the worst Hilton brand hotel that I have ever experienced, and quite possibly the worst hotel that Ive ever visited in 25 years of international travel. I will mention only a few of the many concerns and disappointments that we experienced.On check-in, we were offered an upgrade to a Club room on the 44th floor. The room was so tiny there was no space to walk around the bed. When we complained, we were given a room on the 6th floor that looked out on the lower level roof and straight onto massive air conditioning units.The first evening before going out for dinner, we asked for some clean towels and to have our room freshened up. Nothing had been done by the time we came back at 11pm. I called downstairs, and was bounced back and forth between departments  a consistent problem in this hotel  until finally speaking with the Assistant Director of Housekeeping. He was the only staff member during our entire stay that seemed qualified or showed any concern in the least for our satisfaction. He told me that evening turn down service is by request only. I pointed out that we had requested service, but to no avail. He called back later and apologized that no one had serviced the room. He promised us a discount for that night and a better room the next day. This turned out to be a room on the 22nd floor that was more recently renovated and a bit nicer. However, the room still had trash in it from the previous guest, cobwebs in the corners, and no bathtub. Later that night when going to bed, we found strands of hair and some kind of dirt on the sheets.The night before we checked out, we returned to our room at about 11:30pm to find that the keys were not working. We went downstairs, and the front desk clerk said it was our fault the keys didnt work because we must have kept them near our cell phones. She re-issued the keys, and we went back upstairs. The keys still didnt work. We went back down to another front desk clerk and learned that we had been locked out because the room charges had exceeded our credit card limit. We usually pay by AMEX and rarely use the other credit card, and we had no idea that the credit limit would be exceeded during our stay. This rather insulting payment concern was quickly resolved by providing my AMEX card, but getting back into our room was a long ordeal involving a very unfriendly hotel security guard. Ive never in my life experienced anything like it. We were treated like criminal suspects.The next morning when we left, the bellman told us upon picking up our luggage that we needed to pay a $15 charge because we had too many bags. We suspected that this extra service charge was going straight into his pocket. Once downstairs, we were again treated very rudely by the same front desk clerk that had accused us of deactivating the keys the night before. Like most of the staff we met in this hotel, she was surly, insolent, and seemed resentful to be in a service position.I could write a book about this hotel, but lets sum it by saying that we will never again set foot in the Hilton New York.	
Mar 19 2007 	Excellent location hotel and city	Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in Feb. Room was massive with a fantastic view, overlooking the Empire State Building. Broadway and Times Square are on your door step. It is a perfect location. The hotel was spotless and clean. All staff and cleaners were friendly and helpful, left us water each night and gave us fresh towels for the morning with a turn down service. Didn't eat in the hotel as slightly expensive along with room service. One tip, if you don't want anything out of the mini bar, don't take anything out because as soon as you remove an item it is charged to your room!Could not fault this hotel and would recommend this hotel and stay here again on my next visit.	
Jan 11 2005	Really good overall	We had two rooms at the TS Hilton during the period 21st to 27th December 04. We were happy with just about everything. Even the smoking rooms didn't &quot;smell&quot; too bad. (We had one smoking room and one non-smoking room). Our rooms were on the higher-up floors so we had a good view also (towards the Hudson River). The front desk clerk on check-in was helpful and very welcoming and fixed up our request for smoking room without any problem. (He might have been called Alexander - I'm not sure - I had thought to remember his name on check-in because he was so nice to us!).Because we left generous tips in our room (non-smoking one) every morning and every night, we got good room servicing and at night we got our bed turned down and a replacement of bottled water and towels etc. This was important to me as we were able to shower or bathe at will without regard to how the towels would hold out - unfortunately probably without regard to the &quot;environment&quot;. This was better service than our hotels here in Australia (only two towels per room here!). However, the other room (smoking) didn't leave a tip for night-time turn-down and they didn't get any special treatment - although their room was pretty daunting what with all the clothes and things piled up!The security on the street entrance was a good thing. We didn't eat at the hotel generally except for one meal - which was Christmas night dinner - we had thought it might be Christmas oriented so thought we might splash out and at least get a Christmassy-style meal - but it wasn't - it was just the ordinary menu.There was a bit of noise coming from our next door neighbours - mainly I think through the inter-connecting door - and that might cause a problem if you had really noise neighbours.Also, if you are planning on going to a Broadway show or the like, make plans early - as far as I could see you have no hope of getting tickets unless you book in advance.	
Jul 29 2008 	Very nice New York hotel	Very nice hotel. Good location, but if you need evening life - choose other place - Chealsia, Soho or Grenvichvillage, cose everithing closed after 7 p.m. - cafe and restrans. Rooms are small but nice and clean. We choosed this hotel about good location and cose its new...everithing is fresh.	
Feb 20 2008	Excellent location and helpful staff.	This was our first time in New York and this was an excellent location - on 45th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. We felt safe walking the streets in the area at night time. Walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Centre. We also walked from the hotel to Central Park, Bloomingdales and Macys. The rooms are typical Holiday Inn Express - Small, but clean and comfortable. The lifts were quick and we were never delayed. We had no problems with the complimentary breakfast or the seating (eventhough the area was small). The staff were always very friendly and helpful. There is a pizza/korean takeaway across the road from the hotel if you are too tired to go out for the night and you want to bring food back to the room (it also sells bottles of wine). We had flown from Ireland to JFK and used Airlink (www.airlinknyc.com) for transport to the hotel from JFK Airport (they collected us on a bus from the airport to Central Station where they used minibuses to take us to our hotel, they also collected us from the hotel to the airport, without any problems). Just one thing we found was that while children under 12 years are free on the bigger Airlink buses they are not free on the smaller Airlink minibus which return you to the airport, but the driver would not charge us the fee for our daughter. We will stay at this hotel again on our next trip to NYC and we will also use Airlink for transport to/from the airport. We booked the Airlink just outside the door of JFK Airport and the rooms we booked on holiday-inn.com	
Feb 19 2008 	Great accommodation great location highly recommended	My boyfriend and I chose this hotel based on the reviews it had got here on Trip Advisor, from all the hotels we had read reviews for, this always seemed to have far more good reviews then bad. We went for a 5 night stay over Valentines and booked our trip through BA.com. This hotel and accommodation is very good value for money, its location is fantastic! The rooms were clean, tidy and were cleaned and had fresh linen every day. The lobby for breakfast was small and we didn't use it as there are two Starbucks within 2 mins from the hotel which we chose to use!! The location is unbeatable, its mins from Times Square, Rockafellar Plaza, Radio City Music Hall, Grand Central Terminal, Empire State Building to name but a few. The only time we used the subway was to go to Brooklyn so we could walk back across the bridge. We walked to Central Park from the hotel also and that took about 20-30 mins but its a fab walk along Fifth Ave past all the fab shops and you don't even notice the time! If you are not fussed about having 5 star luxury and want a hotel that is good value for money, clean, tidy, comfortable, friendly and mins away from all the sights then I would recommend this hotel with no hesitation.	
Aug 14 2007 	Great Little Hotel	Excellent clean Hotel. Location is very, very good, especially if you havn't been to NYC before. You walk around the corner and you are on 5th Av, shortwalk to Empire State, Rockerfellor, St Pats, Central Park, Times Square, Hells kitchen. Breakfast included, rooms are clean, excellent cable. Very good value. Tip tehre is a deli bottle shop pizza place across the road perfect for snacks or a cheap meal. The pizzas there are awesome.	
Feb 5 2009 	Bad Experience	Date: January 26 to February 2, 2009Reviewer: Lee Pu ShengWe have just returned from a week stay at the Holiday Inn Express Madison Square Garden NYC, and the experience was terrible! My wife left her purse in the room the only time and found out that someone took US$300 from her! Four T-shirts were also missing from our luggage after we check them with the hotel since we had a late flight home!! Ironically, one of the T-shirt had the new American president's picture on it; :Yes We Can- Steal!!!&quot;There is certain a negligence on our part since we should have all our stuff with us when going out, also, we would not be able to provide any solid evidence to prove the said thefts were carried out by abyone in the hotel; still, we would like to remind all possible customers: Be Prepared!!!!	
Apr 29 2008 	Great Location Great Hotell and Great Breakfast	I thought this was a fantastic hotel. Okay, the room was on the small side. However, the amenities were great. The bathroom had a bath and shower and the free toiletries were extensiv and to a very high standard. The complimentary breakfast really set you up for that day's exploring. I can't believe the variety and quality of the food provided plus there was free tea and coffee proviided thoughout the day. There was everything from fruit, yogurt, bagels and muffins to sausages, hash browns and egg and this varied daily.Madison Square Gardens was literally just around the corner and Macy's about five minutes walk away which was good when transporting all the packages back to the hotel! It would have been a 10 minute walk to Times Square.Found reception staff to be good. One recommended a Chinese close by (we arrived late at night) which was really good.	
Oct 29 2006	Broken dirty window overpriced poor breakfast	Location is in Chinatown. My room was extremely noisy. Window did not close well. As I tried I got my hand dirty. Breakfast cost $24 for 2 and was horrible. Fruit was uneatable, eggs were cold, no doughnuts, cakes or anything good. Do not go there.	
May 31 2008 	No rave review here	My husband and I stayed here on the last three days of our honeymoon, and I have to say our first impressions of the hotel were not great. Upon arrival we checked into our room, only to be given a smoking room. We requested a non-smoking room, to be told there were none available at all, but if we were to come back by 9am the next morning we could be swapped the next day. When we got to our room it had two double beds, which were tiny and basically resulted in my husband and I sleeping in separate beds for the remainder of our honeymoon. The stench of cigarette smoke was by far the worst I've ever smelt in my life, and it reminded me of some seedy dark bar. It caused my husbands asthma to flare up as well. When we arrived at our room the television was on, and would not turn off at all. When we called front desk for assistance, it seemed like we were causing them much inconvenience, and the handyman also seemed a bit peeved to be called out. The next morning at 8.15am we went to the front desk to follow up on our request for a non-smoking room, only to be met by a very unpleasant staff member behind the desk. She told us that we could not be assigned another room, because we already had one, and there was nothing actually broken or wrong with the room to warrant a change. I understand if the hotel is fully booked however she was quite rude in the manner of dealing with our request, which annoyed me the most. Cleanliness was not great - we left our room at 8.15am one morning and I noticed some breakfast dishes in the hallway outside one of the rooms...no big deal except that the exact same dishes and leftover food were still sitting there when we returned at 5pm that day!Unfortunately those few small things managed to really sour my view of this hotel. The rooms were generally adequate and other staff were quite helpful. The location was fabulous, easy to walk to lots of food shops, broadway and times square. My advice to other travellers would be that if you want a queen size bed and non-smoking room, be absolutely clear WHEN YOU BOOK that you must have those and that you will not compromise!	
Jul 13 2006 	Good for New York even if not a Good Hotel	As many regular travellers with a &quot;normal&quot; nightly budget will know, New York may be one of the World's Great Cities, but its greatness is in no way based on the quality of its middle-of-the-road hotels: these tend to have small rooms, aging decor and poor customer service.So although in any other city this Holiday Inn would be &quot;just another cookie-cutter Holiday Inn&quot;, these attributes in New York, in particular the room sizes, elevate it above much of the competition.And the location, not far from Columbus Circle, is very convenient.Would I go back? Yes, I have been doing so for years.	
Aug 3 2005	Great Value	We definitely plan on staying here again soon. The hotel is newly renovated, clean and within walking distance to Central Park, Lincoln Center and Roosevelt Hospital (which is why we are here). It also features a pool on the roof top, restaurant, all in all, a much better than average Holiday Inn. New York City hotels are so expensive, but you will not be disappointed in this one.	
Apr 19 2009 	très bien situé		
Oct 5 2008 	Another good Holiday Inn	We stayed here for two nights at the start of a family holiday. The room was a little small, but hey, this is Manhattan! The hotel itself and the staff were great, very helpful, very slick, good luggage handling/storage etc, and the only wifi of the holiday which accepted my own outgoing mail server. We didn't do breakfast (expensive) but there are lots of diners and restaurants just around any corner. If you just want somewhere comfortable, clean and secure to lay your head, this is as good as any. It pays to watch the website very carefully for prices - we got two nights cheaper than one night the following month.	
Jun 22 2009 	Good value mid	If you are after a good value mid-range hotel that has just the key essentials but is well located in manhattan, then this is a good option. Not the best option for an extended stay in real comfort but well suited to a few days of touring NY. Our room was small but always very clean and included the key essentials. Shared bathroom down the hallway was also very clean and almost never busy. Good eating options nearby including japanese &amp; cheap pizza place immediately adjacent, plus plenty of other good options within 500 metres. Subway 2 blocks away and Empire State Building within a few blocks and partial views of it from our room. Staff were always helpful and responsive with our needs. Would stay here again without hesitation.	
Dec 8 2004	Fab place on a budget	We were greeted by receptionist Richard, he was very helpful. Rooms were small,but clean and it had cable tv. You don't normally stay in room long enough to worry about size. The hotel is very nr Empire state building (2 blocks) i found it very easy to get about from this hotel, subway is only around the corner. Richard even arranged a limo to pick us up aswell. i cannot fault this hotel at all.	
Jan 31 2009 	Vraiment un très on hôtel bien situé très propre et bon marché		
Mar 28 2008 	A very pleasant stay at hotel 373	We just stayed 7 nights at hotel 373 and had a very pleasant experience. We stayed in a Petite double room and found that it was bigger than we expected after reading the reviews. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was great. All very clean and modern. We had requested a room away from the elevator (after reading the reviews) and the room was not too noisy at all. There is no safe in the room but there is one in the basement so we could leave our passports and credit cards etc... for free. Also on the day we left as our plane was late in the evening they kept our luggage for us for free and we even got a receipt for each bag we left. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.I would definitely stay there again.	
Aug 22 2009 	Great Location at a Great Price	This hotel is in an amazing location, literally a 30 sec walk and you are into times square. For it's location the price is fantastic as well, we paid $200 per night which as you know is very good for NY. All the staff we encountered were fantastic, very friendly, always offering help.Room has free WIFI and a free breakfast with pastries and juiceMany reviews on this site comment on the small rooms, yes they are a little on the small side, but seriously how much time do you spend in your room in NY. My wife and I had 2 massive suitcases with us and we still were able to navigate around the room comfortably with these opened up on the floor.We would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again when we come back to NY.	
Jan 17 2005	Great Hotel	First time in New York. Got to Hotel late Sunday night and was greeted by Marian who checked us in quickly with no problem. We were very tired after a long night travelling !Got to room on smoking floor that was a good size with safe, ironing board, aveda products in bathroom and very clean with clean towels every day. Staff were very very helpful.Stayed a week and saw all sights. Bought a $21 subway pass each. Subway was easy to navigate went everywhere and subway pass very good value. New Yorkers were polite, helpful and friendly. All in all had a great time and will definitely be back.	
Nov 19 2007 	Perfect Location	Hotel Beacon was in a fabulous location for seeing all things in NYC. As other reviewers have said, it has great access to the subway and is in walking distance to Central Park. The rooms are clean and have a great lay-out. Having the kitchenette proved to be a great benefit for breakfast! Also, the Fairway across the street was very convenient.I also found the staff to be very helpful. Our flights were delayed and we didn't arrive until the next morning but were able to go right to our room at 8am. Also, our flight out was late in the afternoon and we left our bags with the concierge with no problems. I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler looking for convenience, great ambiance and a reasonable price tag. I'm definitely booking this place when I go back next year!	
Aug 22 2007 	Great deal for Manhattan	We stayed only one night, but based on our experience we would definitely return to the Beacon. For a paltry (by NYC standards) $255 plus tax, four of us were more than comfortable in a one-bedroom (w/ two double beds) suite w/ kitchenette. The suite was large (and not just by NYC standards) and luckily for us had the added advantage of being a corner unit with great views (22nd floor). Our only minor complaints were beds that weren't quite firm enough and a bathroom that was a little on the small side. We didn't explore the area around the hotel, but as others have noted here, there are plenty of restaurants and a grocery store nearby, and it's a convenient enough location from which to get around the city. We were able to park on the street for free overnight, just around the block from the hotel. Overall this hotel is a very good value for Manhattan, at least compared to the half-dozen or so other places in the city, Brooklyn, and Secaucus where we've stayed over the last three years.	
May 12 2006	Depressing Decor Great Location.	In my opinion, the only thing the Beacon Hotel has going for it is it's excellent location and friendly staff. The Hotel itself is in desperate need of a facelift. The rooms are antiquated and are painted a disturbingly gloomy shade of pink. The air conditioning system belongs in the National HIstory Museum and the bathrooms are uncomfortably small. To best conjure the perfect image, think dodgy seaside B&amp;B in a backwash town circa 1970's and you have the Beacon interior. Do not expect 'any' of the usual perks and luxury you would usually expect from such a costly hotel. Although shabby, the rooms are clean and a newspaper is delivered, roughly every second day, however that is the extent of it. On the upside, the Beacon Hotel is situated beside Filene's Basement Department Store and adjacent to 72nd Subway station. I urge you to utilize the subway, great efforts have been made to make it safe. My mother is in her 70's and is happy to use it alone (during daylight hours). The Hotel receptionist will furnish you with a good map free of charge.In real terms, it's hard to get great accomodation in NY unless you are willing to bend your platinum card, however, it is really not good enough to pretend that this hotel is acceptable under modern day value for money standards. Rather, consider it the best of a bad bunch within the room rate bracket.	
Dec 18 2005	Very pleased with the Beacon	We came to New York after eight weeks in the UK and Europe, and were very pleasantly surprised with the Beacon. It's old and a little bit shabby, but better than many we had stayed in. The room was large and pretty comfortable, but the kitchenette with stove, fridge and microwave was an unexpected treat. There is a brilliant 24-hour market just opposite, and we were able to stock up and eat some home-cooked meals that didn't cost a fortune.The location is good (handy to a subway station and a nice walk to Central Park). The staff were more helpful than average for New York. And having a laundromat just down the hallway from our room was extremely convenient.	
Jun 4 2005	Great place for families	We stayed at the Beacon in mid May 2005.We're a family of 5 and really liked the space in the rooms and the great location of the hotel (close to both the river and the Park).I've seen some other reviews that slag off the decor - well it is a bit faded and if this matters to you then I guess you shouldn't stay at the Beacon.If however you need a good location, good prices and great space for your family then I'd definitely recommend the Beacon.Other things of interest:1. Fairway market is great2. The nearby Boat Basin Cafe, just on the Hudson river, is great for a meal and a drink	
Jan 13 2005	It was great but...	I stayed from December 13 for 6 nights. Upper West Side is great, the hotel is in the very nice location. I could relax. But on final day , I got call from reception. A woman staff said to me &quot; You have to come to the reception and you should check out !&quot; . I said &quot; I am going to check out tomorrow&quot;. But she said &quot; No&quot;. So I said &quot; I have a confirmation e-mail &quot;. Then she said &quot;Wait a minutes.............OK, you'll check out tomorrow. Thank you&quot;. She never apologized. I should have asked her name. I suggest you please keep your confirmation.	
Feb 12 2004	Loved the hotel	My stay at the Beacon was enjoyable. I loved the room, it was big! The concierge was extremely helpful, told me where to go to find the secret TKTS. I loved having a subway location nearby, we were on it constantly! Also, having the world class grocery store nearby gave it points on my list, especially since it was nice to come back to the room at the end of the day and eat supper in the room. I plan to go back and the Beacon is where I will stay!	
Apr 28 2009 	The walk to/from Madison Square Garden is HELL (at night)	Lovely hotel, bed, shower, all that. Two complaints: weak batteries in remote and very LOUD flush for toilet. Man at desk said no street was really nice to walk to Madison Square Garden (though he did suggest a good pub en route). After the show Saturday night, the very short walk back (from 8th Ave to the hotel between 5th and Madison) was AWFUL.Prostitutes, would-be thieves, disgusting people, catcalling people, harassing people, just very scary for a city-savy person such as myself. Man, you need game-face to walk these NY streets.Given what I paid, I don't want this nighttime neighborhood around. WHAT is going on in NYC with these disgusting, scary people about at night. I almost checked into the closets hotel to MSG just to get away from it all.	
Oct 21 2008 	Great little place	We were pleasantly surprised by Hotel Chandler. We were expecting a cramped little place, with rushed staff, and maybe not the cleanest facilities, because of the relatively cheaper price we were paying for our room. We got the exact opposite! Wonderful attentive staff, and clean rooms with pretty nice amenities. The room was still on the small side but cozy and well furnished with an LCD tv, ipod player, and free wireless connection.It's also in a great location being just a few blocks from the Empire State building, Koreatown, and the subway station. It was very easy to hop on the train and head to other parts of the city.The only issue with the room was that temperature was hard to control. It was either hot and stuffy with the air off, or very cold with the air on. There seemed to be no way to find a happy medium.We will still definitely stay here again on our next trip to new york city!	
Aug 8 2007 	Perfect Boutique Hotel!!!	We booked this hotel after reviewing all the helpful reviews and for the location. This hotel is 4 blocks up from Madison Square Garden. It is 2 blocks from the Empire State Building. I don't know why people are complaining about it being out of the way-this is New York-you are supposed to be walking places to absorb the city! We walked from Penn Station to the hotel and checked in to an adorable queen bed room at the end of the hallway so only 1 neighbor but it didn't matter because we didn't hear anything outside our room. The room had black out shades-WHICH WERE FABULOUS! There is a turn down service each night and the complimentary products are Aveda. The staff was wonderful and helpful and there is free on site internet and a hotel computer to use. Overall we would definitely stay here again. We loved the location and had a great time. The hotel offers complimentary tea and coffee and apples in the back bar area all day and the bell staff is phenomenal!	
Oct 17 2006 	Dishonest and truly mediocre	I'll be short so you can move onto a better subject...1. The hotel is so far from luxurious you'll be surprised at every turn, expect very little for a large price. It is so exaggerated on the website you'll wish for honesty in advertising.2. The price we booked at had been inflated by $45 a night with no explanation, apology, or recourse.3. Front desk staff was at times rude and at best apathetic.4. Our room looked into a back alley dump area for $325 a night.5. We heard quite a lot of our neighbours both in their room and when they were fighting in the hallway at 4 am.6. The linens are lovely and the soap is nice but it is a little sad that this is the only area I can compliment.In the end I had a fantastic time with my Mom in NY, but I would never, ever stay at this mediocre, amateur hotel again. I have learned my lesson and would suggest you go to another mid-range hotel, and get confirmation of you room rate in writing.I look forward to seeing this hotel change ownership because NY is pretty competitive and Hotel Chandler does not cut it.	
Jan 8 2008 	Wonderful Experience!!!	My recent stay at the Elysee was just marvelous! The moment we arrived the staff was friendly and courteous from the Doorman to the Front Desk and even the attentive young ladies in the Breakfast room  all were there to please. The room was wonderful, exactly what we expected. We were worried at first about a front facing room, as I've read complaints about the noise, but that concern was put to rest after the first night as noise was minimal especially given we're in midtown Manhattan (although the bed was so comfortable I could have slept through anything)! My final comment will be on the bathrooms as my wife and I are very fussy about these things. Although a bit small for our liking it was impeccably clean and the marble was an extra nice touch. The Elysee is our new favorite hotel in NYC as the value, location, and staff far exceeds any of our previous experiences in New York.	
Jun 21 2005 	Awful Service Complaints Ignored by Staff	We checked into our suite and our mini-fridge was broken -- the door wouldn't close all the way and thus the unit couldn't keep anything cold. Not a huge problem -- if it were taken care of in a timely fashion. What happened next blew my mind. We allerted the fellow who'd brought our bags up to the problem. He assured us he'd notify the engineer and that he'd be right up to fix it. Cut to next morning: No engineer. We wanted to throw some food and beers in the fridge, but no dice, still broken. I call the front desk and they say sorry, they'll send someone right up. We leave for a few hours to do some business, come back, fridge is still broken. I go down to the front desk, complain, she says she'll send someone right up. Several hours later no one has showed up. I call and ask to speak to a manager. Which manager? Hotel manager. I'm transfered to another number where no one answers, then bounced back to the operator. I tell her I've been trying now for over 24 hours to get this simple thing fixed and why isn't it fixed? She says she'll send a manager right up. An hour and a half go by and no one shows. I'm about to punch somebody, so I go to the gym while my girlfriend goes down to try talking to someone. The engineer happens to be right there, says no one has even told him about the problem and he heasn't heard anything about it on the radio. So who's lying? someone clearly is. The engineer comes right up and fixes the problem, but no manager ever returned my calls to apologize for the delay, and I still have no idea why our complaints were brazenly ignored for more than a day!	
Nov 24 2009 	My favorite hotel in New York	I loved the Giraffe. We only stayed one night and got some kind of promotional rate on a room, but they upgraded us -- for free -- to suite. The facilities were immaculate, the service was fantastic, and the breakfast was delicious. On the way home, I forgot a poster I bought, and the hotel called me on my cell phone before I could call them. They even Fedexed it to me for free. This is a great hotel.	
Aug 9 2009 	Excellent!	Amazing loccation, friendly staff. Great price. I felt like we should have paid a lot more for what we got. We will always stay there while visiting NYC.	
Aug 19 2009 	Comfortable and Quiet!	My boyfriend and I were on a budget and didn't want to spend a lot of money on hotels as we were going to NYC to view the city and not stay in our hotel room. Our trip was for 4 nights and 5 days. We found this hotel on Expedia for about $100/night CAD which was a great deal compared to some of the other hotels. Before we left, I read some reviews about this hotel so a week before we left, I emailed the hotel and requested a room in a quiet section of the hotel.Check-in was really quick and easy. They were also flexible with us checking in before 4pm (their check-in time). The room was clean and small with a double bed, but that was okay as we were expecting this. The bed was really soft and comfortable, however, my boyfriend didn't think it was firm enough; nonetheless we both slept very well each night and the room was a great location as it was really quiet (no outside noise). There was also a mini-fridge which was very handy as the week we were there, it was really hot so we could buy bottles of water and store it in the fridge. The people at the hotel were really nice and accomodating. The manager even gave us a free pass at the internet since it was our first usage. The hotel also had a secured luggage storage area which was useful as on the day of check-out, our transportation wasn't going to be until later that evening so we were able to put our luggages into storage at no cost and do a one last tour of the city and then retrieve the luggages later that evening. The location of the hotel is excellent! It is literally about a block away from the Empire State Building. You could even walk to Times Square! It's only about a 30 minute walk from the hotel to Times Square one way. This hotel is also close to food areas. The only thing we didn't know about the hotel was that it is in Korea Town, which is fine, but since there are a lot of Korean/Japanese restaurants on the same street as the hotel, if you walk that street, it reeks of garbage. We arrived Saturday afternoon and all weekend, as soon as you stepped outside, it stank! However, the smell toned down a bit during the week (probably because garbage trucks were working again). I thought that was the only downfall, but since the hotel is in a great location, we bear it!The hotel also has a cafe beside it so it was really convenient to just grab a bagel/muffin or something and go on your way instead of having to search for a breakfast place. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would come stay there again when we come back to NYC.	
Jan 5 2006	Great Room for the price just what we expected	We went into Manhatten to vist my sister in law. She booked the rooms for us as the Hotel Grand Union. The hotel is just around the corner from her townhome so it was a great location. It is a quaint hotel and the staff could not have been nicer. First let me state that it is not luxurious, but comfortable. A great base point if your not going to be in your room all the time. It was just my hubby and myself, we had a room with a full bed, nice bathroom an apt size frig, tv and we opted not to get the phone in our room. There were a few problems, but I am not to much of a complainer, but some people might not be able to deal with them. First, the water in the shower did not stay hot. I had to keep jumping out of the stream of water at times as it went from hot to cold. Second, there was no thermostat to regulate the heat so the room was like an oven. it had the old steam pipe heating. Thank goodness it was 30 degrees outside, so we opened the small window in the bedroom area and the window in the bathroom. We even went as far as turning on the airconditioner that was in the room. That seemed to help quite a bit. There is only one small elevator so it would suffice to say you need to be patient. There are plenty of great restaruants around the area. A little coffe shop is locted through a door in the lobby of the hotel. It is very small and serves up a great breakfast sandwich. They also have internet access in their lobby, 3 pc's set up, you can purchase minutes at the desk. A nice little sitting area is adjacent to the computers if you want to just sit an read or have a cup of coffee. I had gone down as they had some local artist's work up on display there. Besides I needed to get out of the room and get some air. We had rented a car as we had arrived in NYC and drove to the Poconos for a few days, then came into Manhatten. We had to park our vehicle for 3 days which ran us $78.00. That wasn't bad and it was a secure udnerground lot. All in all it was a good place to hang our hats! When we were there it had snowed and it was cold! We had great time and would stay there again. Oh by the way we were on the 9th floor. one other thing getting off the elevator on our floor was a challenge. Very small corridors, but you get what you pay for!	
Aug 30 2009 	Two room suite was great for a six day stay	We stayed six nights in a two room suite with our twenty-something daughter and her boyfriend. Rooms were large and very quiet for being in the midst of a busy area. The beds were comfortable and the A/C worked well - blessed relief since it was very hot and muggy during our stay. The breakfast was varied and quick. There was one small bathroom for the two rooms, but there were two sinks, one next to the shower and the other in a dressing area.Staff were exceptionally polite and helpful. The location is near shopping, Times Square and many other places to visit are an easy walk. It is also less than a block from a major subway hub. Taxis were always out front as well. Altogether it was a fine hotel from which to base a visit to New York City. We recommend it highly.	
Feb 9 2009 	Fantastic Location	Stayed here with a friend as part of a &quot;special birthday&quot; celebration.Location is brilliant only 1 block from Macy's and the Empire State Building. Got an upgrade to the penthouse floor - room very comfortable. Spectatcular views available from the rooftop terrace.Staff were great and as well as FREE continental breakfast included in the price - FREE tea and coffee 24 HOURS PER DAY !!!!.Definately recommend.	
May 30 2007 	Good Hotel	The Metro is very central. Empire State building, Macy`s very near and Penn Station and Time Square within easy walking distance and a subway station on the cornerWe found the hotel to be very clean (bed clothes changed every day). Staff friendly and helpful our room (601) overlooking an alley was a bit small. It was slightly noisy with extractor fans from nearby reataurants working all night. Our own air conditioning system worked well but was also rather niosy too. but we soon got used to it. The breakfast was better than we expected with a good choice and plentiful. Overall the Metro is a great hotel and we would recomend it to our friends and stay there again.	
Sep 18 2008 	Loved the facilities and location	Despite a few hiccoughs with the booking confirmation, the staff were great and kept me up to date even before we arrived. The room faciliaites were great with 2 queen beds, a small kitchen area (with microwave) and a bathroom with wetroom area.The hotel is ideally located on the main subway line at 96th Street. An express Brooklyn bound train takes you to the heart of Times Sqaure in just a few minutes.	
Jan 31 2007	Great hotel for the money	We stayed at the Newton over the past week and were very impressed with the rooms, location, cleanliness, and service from the front desk. As one of the better bargains in the City, we weren't sure what were we going to get for our money. However, we were pleasantly surprised. Our room was clean, impeccably tidied up everyday, and comfortable. With that, the room for two adults and three small children was a little tight, but we were prepared for that, not expecting the Waldorf. As far as location, it is in quiet neighborhood and very convenient to the 1, 2, or 3 trains (subway stop about a block from the hotel). Central Park is also about a 3 block (ave. block) walk from the hotel.This is obviously not an upper tier or 5 star hotel, but definitely a good spot for the budget-minded traveler.	
Feb 8 2005	Great affordable stay!	I recently returned from a weekend at the Newton, and I was very happy with my stay. I found the place to be clean and the staff polite. Check-in and check-out were both easy- without waits or complications. The elevator did seem to be a bit slow, but I was fortunate and never really had to wait. The room itself was clean with the basic amenities. It was not plush, but it was certainly nicer than I had expected. I found the staff to be accommodating. For example, we asked for extra towels and received them right away.  I booked a double/double room. I was a little freaked out by the &quot;shared bathroom&quot; concept, but I called before I made the reservation to assure we would have our own bath. One morning after two hot showers, our third guest had cold water. She just waited a few minutes, however, and the water was warm again. Our beds were firm as mentioned in other reviews. After being on my feet all day, however, my back welcomed it.  My response to the complaints of previous reviewers about noise outside the windows, thin walls, rattling heaters, etc. is- it's New York City! The buildings are older, you hear things. I just moved from NYC two months ago, and I found the building to be very similiar to my apartment and the apartments of other friends there. We are all professionals- college graduates, many with masters and doctorate degrees, with decent standards of living. I feel as if any noise issues at the Newton might be encountered anywhere else in the city. You aren't on a trip to the farm or the beach, it's a city and it's not a quiet place! All of that said, I slept like a rock (as did my two friends from quieter places who have never lived in New York). If you need complete silence in order to sleep, bring earplugs. You might still hear noise at a posh hotel downtown.  As far as the location goes, there is an express train and a crosstown bus only a few feet away! You can't ask for much more than that. If you are concerned about the distance from Times Square, take the 2 or 3 train downtown and you will be there in two stops. You can get most anywhere you need to go quickly with that close proximity to a subway. If you want to go to the East side, you can take the M96 crosstown bus. Your metro card works there just the same, and you get one free transfer from bus to subway and vice versa. Check out hopstop.com if you want advice on public transportation routes, or ask anyone. Most New Yorkers are more than willing to help you with directions.  I personally prefer to be where people live, not in the middle of the tourist chaos in midtown. The Upper West Side is a nice neighborhood. Many celebrities live there. As far as restaurants go, Lemongrass Grill a few doors down has good Thai, and Mama Mexico on Broadway between 101st and 102nd is a fun, festive Mexican restaurant. I hear Carmine's is a a good family-style Italian place on B'way and 91st. Somewhere near Carmine's is a Tal Bagels, for a good, authentic New York bagel. Tom's Restaurant is on Broadway and 112th. It is where Suzanne Vega wrote &quot;Tom's Diner&quot;, and you might recognize it from all of the outside shots of the restaurant in Seinfeld. The food is nothing spectacular there, but it's &quot;pop culture historic&quot;. I also like Cafe Con Leche (Cuban/Dominican food). I have been to their other location on Amsterdam b/t 80th and 81st, but I noticed they also had a location near the hotel on Amsterdam b/t 95th and 96th.  If you don't find any food you like around the hotel, go down one or two stops to 86th or 79th. There are plenty of restaurants in the &quot;80s&quot; block along Columbus or Amsterdam. My out-of-town guests always liked Cafe Lalo on W.83rd b/t Broadway and Amsterdam. It was featured in You've Got Mail. It's a cute place, and they have quite an extensive dessert menu. (Go there for dessert, not a meal.)  In conclusion, if you are looking for a luxurious place to stay in New York City, don't stay at the Newton. (But expect to pay at least twice as much per night.) If you want a decent, clean place to sleep in a good location in Manhattan, I recommend the Newton. For what you pay for it, it's a great deal. And you can save your money for shopping, plays, sightseeing, and good meals. 	
Jul 11 2005	Glamour and Funk--Rivington delivers both	This hotel is for those who appreciate cutting-edge design, a hip attitude, and being the first to experience something new. Rooms are sleek and minimal, the bathrooms spectacular. Mattresses are Tempur-pedic. Sheets and towels are Frette, bathrobes the best I've ever seen, and the toiletries are Paul LeBrecque. Complimentary breakfast includes pastries from Balthazar, fresh squeezed orange juice and espresso. Staff is gorgeous (check out Jonathan, the bartender) and helpful. All this for only $235 a night! You would pay double this price uptown. Which brings us to the potential downside for many: the hotel is in the Loisaida, which is not central to many of the typical tourist sites. The neighborhood is a rapidly gentrifying, trendy, funky area of tenements, with a population of artists, Hispanics, and Chinese. The F train is around the corner, but if you like to stroll to the Met, this is not for you.	
Sep 24 2009	bella sorpresa!		
Nov 11 2008 	Super Location-Great Price	I arrived at Hotel St James, got my key and hurried to my room to see what kind of deal we had truly gotten. I was pleasantly surprised to find our hotel room large from what I hear the typical NY room would be. The bathroom was SUPER clean. That was especially important to me. This may be a 2 star hotel, but what an excellent place for the price. The staff were all very nice and helpful. It's located literally under a minute of walking to Times Square. The Dunhill Deli is open 24 hours and it's one door down from the hotels door. If you prefer drinks and don't want to walk far from that, then there is a pub that is only a few doors down as well. This is a perfect place to stay if you are looking to save money. It's a clean place to lay your head get some sleep and head out to many local attractions just walking distance away. I would definately come back and stay again, as well as recommend this hotel to anyone of my friends or family. Thanks! My sister and I enjoyed our stay!	
Sep 24 2008	WARNING	Arrived at hotel from Las Vegas following my daughters wedding. There were 10 of us in the party being 4 families. On arrival at 8.30pm we were informed that the rooms had been doubled booked even though we had paid in advance for 4 nights. At 11.30pm the hotel had managed to find alternative accomodation at another hotel. On arrival at the new hotel we found that they only had two rooms available sleeping 4 in total. Six of us slept on the floor. The following day we returned to the St. James Hotel to be told that rooms would be made available later that day. We stayed at the St. James for the remainder of the stay. The hotel have refused to return the payment for the 2 rooms not provided. They have also refused to pay for the taxi fares transporting 10 people and luggage to and from the other hotel. They day we left a similar occurance occured with a family from Brazil. Be warned !!!!!!!!!	
Feb 28 2005	very satisfied	I was very satisfied to Stanford Hotel. It was clean and frienly. The room was not even so small that I expected. It was a good place to sleep in New York and the price was okey. I will recommend this hotel.	
Aug 10 2009 	The best place in New York to stay	I am writing to let everyone know how much I loved my visit to the Hotel Wales.The hotel was very clean and the workers were very , friendly and it was ideally located to the museums we went to as well as the closeness of the places to shop.Tony	
Aug 31 2008 	Beautiful Comfortable and Value for money!!!	We are a theatre company from London, who were desperately in need of an affordable, comfortable and practical hotel. We were more than pleasantly surprised upon our arrival at Wales Hotel!Not only were we welcomed by the most polite and friendly staff but we discovered we were about to spend our next 10 days in one of the most beautiful hotels I've seen. The rooms are decorated with delicately carved wooden furniture, beds that you trully sink in and a bath that invites you to melt in while drinking a lovely glass of chabli ;-)We had the privilige of staying there during the summer, so breakfast was up on the terrace with a fantastic view of Upper New York (water tanks and everything) and ofcourse the amazing Central Park!! The breakfast included very tasty bagels, flufy croissents, cream cheese, jams, fruits, serials and ofcourse a lovely cup of coffee!!The Hotel is also internet friendly with wireless throughout at a low charge and also for those without a laptop there are computer fascilities available.For those of you who are willing to spend a bit more dosh (but still affordable!) I can certainly reccomend the Carnegie Hall Suite with a great view, great space and pictures of some of your favourite stars who have also spent the night there!!!While we were there the hotel was redecorating the interior breakfast area which, after having a quick (illegal) peak through the cracks I discovered that, it was also staring to mirror the details throughout that make this hotel so pleasant to stay in.Overall as I point out in the title the hotel is Beautiful, Comfortable and Value for money!!!A very memorable experience I would reccomend to all and ofcourse I'm planning to return very soon!!	
Oct 27 2009	An Absolute Joke	Location: goodLobby : trendyRoom : absurd!How can this hotel get ANY stars? We booked a room for two. I was getting a bit worried when the hallway looked like what I imagine a NY state penitentary does, dark, dreary, grey. When we opened the door and almost hit the bed, I knew we were in trouble. You would have to walk sideways to get into the &quot;bed&quot;,and I use that term loosely. The top of the bed was below my knees. The bathroom made the airline bathrooms seem spacious. Another wonderful touch was the glass window between the bathroom and bedroom. Plastic cups, a bathroom sink that didn't drain, poor air circulation, paper thin walls, a business center that didn't work....do yourself a favor and book a motel 6. It would be a definite upgrade.	
May 27 2009 	Tiny rooms but very cool overall.	Tiny doesn't even begin to describe the room size--luckily I am petite and was staying alone, so I just found it funny. However, if you are more than 6ft tall or planning to share a room, I'd try for an upgrade beyond the standard room. My 6'3 husband would have had a panic attack from claustrophobia! That said, everything about the Hudson screams cool. When you're in NYC, you're not usually spending much time in the room, so a small room is not really a big deal. The bars are unbelievable, especially the 15th floor terrace. It was a little chilly for May, but they had blankets to keep you warm up there so you could still enjoy the amazing view and great cocktails! Had a light dinner at Cafeteria, good meal with great atmosphere, albeit super dark in there.	
Apr 16 2009 	Better off visiting for a drink than staying here	I stayed at the Hudson in the wintertime after visiting the hotel several times just for drinks. The decor of the bar area and restaurant are just fabulous, the perfect place to go for a martini and mingle/people watch. But as far as staying there, besides being in an excellent location blocks from Central Park, the rooms are TINY!! Not that anywhere in NY you do very well on size, but I've found these &quot;trendier&quot; places are usually especially small and the amenities and rooms feel older, and they spend all their money on the common areas. Better off just coming from a drink.	
Dec 20 2008 	Warning! Proceed with caution	Firstly I have stayed in some wonderful hotels around the world including &quot;to cool for school places like the Hudson. Like other reviewers the bar areas are good but £100 for 8 drinks (not champers) is a little on the &quot;rich&quot; side.The staff as well on the whole were good and the concierge was great.Now the important stuff,* They only had the queen delux room we booked with a shower when we needed a bath, and by the generator so a terrible noise (ask if you are on the 4/5/6th floors its noisy. So they put us in their standard room, for one night and then upgraded us to a studio on the second (nice I thought). The standard room is a joke. No where to put suitcases and I could not fit through the bathroom door without going side on (I'm not overly wide!). We were there with friends and they also tried to pass a standard room off as a deluxe with them - they were moved and not happy.In our first night room (2345) the coat hook was falling off, the bath tap fell off, the caravan effect wood pannelling was loose on the on the door frame, the spot light was coming away from the ceiling, the shower rail had screw holes protuding where they had messed up the installation. I have to say as well in our shoe box the I really did not see the &quot;design&quot; theme in the artex ceiling. The beds were single matress on a frame ( sheets were good), towels were YMCA size and qualityIt was just a shoddy, claustrophobic, cynical attempt to house those people who get so nailed in the bars the wouldnt notice the room size and quality.The hallways were dark and two fire exit signs on the 23rd floor were loose.On the second night the &quot;studio&quot; room was a reasonable size for a normal room. Apparantly having a &quot;seating area&quot; (read a two person sofa at the back of the room) made it a studio. The room was 1617. Better fitting in this room, but a floor board was raised and there looked to be damp or sometype of poor fix over the shower and the bed springs in the wire frame bed were noisyNow the piece that really sealed the fate of this hotel from our perspective.Our friends were staying in the hotel and I thought to buy them a botttle of champers on room service ($165 for a bottle of Veuve anyone?) My wife bought another present for them, so I asked to cancel the bottle (I had signed). It was not opened and in perfect condition and our friends were were not in the room, so it could have been retrieved. Two managers told me I had signed and they would not take it back, even though I requested this 10mins after signing and I offered to pay the $18 service and $4 delivery charge. I'm still in dispute on this one. (There were 3 other disputes going on as we checked out)I know this is long but I wanted to be precise and descriptive.In summary, over priced, poor quality, cynically small rooms, but with generally nice staff. Stay somewhere else and if you really m ust, enjoy the bar.	
Jan 23 2008 	"Exceeded our expectations!"	My wife and I just spent 2 nights in the Spa Suite over the weekend of Jan 18-20. Our expectations for a &quot;special place&quot; to stay were somewhat set after reading all the reviews here prior to making our recent booking. Well, our expectations were actually exceeded. We both totally agree with ALL the positive comments made in previous reviews, so it's difficult to think of anything new or unique to add. We have traveled extensively for both business and pleasure over the past 35+ years. We've had the pleasure of staying at many very fine hotel and resort properties, and even some really good B&amp;B's both in the States and abroad. But I can say that we found staying at The Inn NYC to be more like staying at a good friend's place. Sharing not just a room, but part of their &quot;home.&quot; We 've already booked the Library and Opera suites for December '08. My wife and I will be taking our son, daughter, spouses and 2 grandsons for 4 nights after Christmas through New years Day. We're convinced that it's the perfect choice for a special and memorable holiday-time place to stay in NYC. My wife and I have already told friends and family who travel to New York regularly about how impressed we are with Inn New York City. Unfortunatley, I think bookings may now become harder to come by. I know my wife and I plan to stay at Ruth's Inn on ALL our future trips to New York City. But since we're not aware of anyplace like the Inn new York City elsewhere, we'll have to settle for just another hotel when traveling to any other city. Thanks, Ruth for your hospitality. You and your daughter have created a truly special place. We're already planning our Christmas-time trip and are looking forward to another relaxing and wonderful stay at your &quot;place.&quot;Jim &amp; Sue M. Fort Worth, TX	
Nov 18 2009 	top of the line service	it was top of the line excellent room service. clean rooms good food nice attractions near the hotel. i reccommend anyone going to new york to stay there	
Oct 20 2009 	Lived up to expectations	Had read a few negative reviews before travellingOur experience was of good quality rooms with fresh decorFacilites Ok although drinks , food expensive-like any 5 star realklyStaff were friendly and helpful throughot our stay-5 nights.Hotel has an olf fashiioned ambience and style and a beautiful looby.In short we all liked our stay here, which was very well situated in Midtown for most sites etc	
Aug 24 2009 	The Intercontinental Strategy	Well, after the stay in Milwaukee and now the Intercontinental Barclay in NYC, I'm starting to notice the corporate strategy. Buy a property, renovate the lobby, restaurants and public spaces, but simply move new furniture into an old dated room. The rooms were old, the carpet spotty and the bathroom dated and no bigger than the passenger seat in my Ford Expedition. I'm getting tired of the strategy and need to find some better hotels.	
Mar 31 2009 	Loved it - had a great expereince	Stayed 5 nights Feb half term - first time to NYC. Bit apprehensive about hotel as I'd booked over internet and didn't know what to expect. Rooms were just fine although ours was slightly larger than the one next door. Bathroom small but functional but didn't go to NY to sit in bathrooms. Bed was huge and amazingly comfortable with crisp quality sheets. TV remote didn't work but one call sorted that out straight away. Our frends said they had no tea/coffee but they just hadn't found the equipment cleverly concealed in the unit. All staff were very helpful and not what I'd been led to expect from New York. The lobby was gorgeous and the bar nice but expensive. Felt quite European in style - lots of wood and stained glass. Also a lot of Europeans staying there.Didn't eat there or use room servicebut used the various delis within 1 minutes walk. where you could get a huge freshly cooked breakfast and bucket of coffee or fresh juice for about 6 dollars. Area felt very safe to walk around and you felt very central for restaurants, subways, 5th avenue, Grand Central etc. Concierge more than happy to recommend and book restaurants. Noise didn't bother us at all although we are used to being in the middle of the countryside. Street noise is to be expected (sirens etc) and honestly wasn't bad on the 12th floor.It just sounded like you were in New York. All in all - I'd definately use this hotel again.	
Jul 25 2008 	Amazing Location Somewhat Tired Historic Hotel	This historic hotel is located in a truly fantastic midtown area. Literally steps from a lot of great NY sights, restaurants, etc.The rooms are stately and clean, and the bed is truly fantastic. Comfortable, excellent sheets, overall great bed experience.The bathroom is old and tiny, and the water regulation in the shower (temperature) can be tricky. Like all hot or all cold!Service was spotty - my key didn't work one night and no one picked up at the front desk after more than 30 rings, so I went all the way downstairs again. Some staff just don't seem like they want to be there.Overall, great hotel, great location, nice rooms...just needs a bit of updating perhaps and the staff (especially for the competitive New York market) needs to perk up a bit.	
Mar 13 2008 	Fantastic Hotel and Great Location	We stayed in the Intercontinental Barclay for four nights between 1st &amp; 5th March. Having read numurous reviews we were quite apprehensive about what to expect but, have come to the conclusion that most of the negative comments are made by American vistiors who expect too much. Most of the comments that have been posted by people from the UK are very favorable and we fall in to that category. The hotel reception area is grand and very beautiful. Our room on the eleventh floor was wonderful, although on the small side but, very comfortable with a fantastic bed. Although many people have made a big issue about street noise we found our room very peaceful which could however, be the benefit of being situated on a higher floor. The room service was perfect and all of the staff which we had the pleasure to deal with were very helpful and curtious. The downside would be the cost of breakfast, roomservice, and the mini-bar which were very expensive. I would recommend using Longwood which is situated accoss the road from the hotel on the corner of Lexington. Here you can eat hot &amp; cold buffet 24/7 at a very reasonable cost and it tastes good too. Very popular with people on their way to work and Taxi drivers which, can't be a bad thing. If you would like a drink I would recommend P J Morans which is situated two or three blocks west along East 48th Street (ie turn left on leaving the hotel and you come to it). Tom the manager from Dublin is very helpful and a great person to talk to. The location of the hotel is ideal for many shops like SAKS (5th Avenue) &amp; Bloomingdales (East 59th Street) and also within easy walking distance of Cental Park, Rockefeller Centre, UN, Times Square, Empire State &amp; Broadway. Overall a fantastic hotel and great location. You cant' go wrong in booking the Barclay!	
Aug 30 2008 	I got a deal here	I put my father up at the Essex house when he came to visit. I booked about a month ahead and got a &quot;Junior Suite&quot; for about $400 a night on Hotels.com (They bulk buy bulk, we were told). The room was not a traditional suite with two rooms but it was most certainly as comfortable as any suite I have had.The service was truly impressive, world class hotel service for a room that was such a bargain. It made a huge difference in his stay, as he has some special needs that were handled with out a hitch.Other things are not a bargain, room service was quite good (and recommended) but expensive, and the hotel restaurant was OK but there are much better places in the neighborhood. My father has limited mobility so when he did not feel like going out the hotel restaurant was fine. But expect to pay about $150 to $200 per person for a dinner that can be had for half the price elsewhere.The area is very touristy, I prefer places away from the Central Park South to Times Square area, but this was such a deal and he wanted to be on CPS, for personal reasons.Finally, if the smell of horse manure is not something you want as part of your NYC experience, CPS is not the place to stay, nor dine al fresco. (Note: There is no smell of it in the hotel). However, if being across the street from Central Park is something you want (Like Jackie O, and other very rich new yorkers do) you get that here.

Apr 1 2008	Clean 	My family and I had never visited the Big Apple before this trip. We were skeptical because we heard the rooms at many New York hotels were tiny and dirty, and that the staffs were often rude and unresponsive. We were very pleasantly surprised by the La Quinta in Manhattan. Our room was at least the same size as other hotels in less crowded cities. It was clean and there were 2 queen size beds (which were a must, but almost impossible to find in the city!). Our room was missing the shower curtain upon arrival. I called the desk and they said someone would be up to correct this. I waited about 20 min. and called again. The clerk was apologetic and said someone would be there immediately. And guess what...they were! The breakfast was great every morning. It was so helpful that we didn't have to spend time finding a restaurant for breakfast and waiting for service. There were bagels, cereal, coffee, tea, fruit, donuts, yogurt, etc. which offered something for everyone in our family.Don't get me wrong - if you're looking for and can afford the Waldorf-Astoria- you may not want to stay here. We also didn't pay $400 - $500 per night either. If you want a reasonable price for a clean, well-maintained, pleasantly run hotel, this is the place for you. We were there to sightsee and wanted a clean, safe place to stay. We got more than we expected. Everyone from housekeeping to concierge to the person keeping the breakfast items stocked to the manager was friendly and helpful. Even if my husband and I go back w/o children, we would definitely stay here again!	
	Great hotel with a good location	This was the second time I had stayed at this hotel and it didn't let me down! Service is always good with very friendly front desk staff. My room was more spacious than the average NYC room and had a great view of Central Park. Norma's (hotel restaurant) is legendary for breakfast but a bit pricey so great there is a starbucks directly opposite or some fab delis nearby. The hotel bar is lovely and they serve a great prosecco! The burger bar also located just off reception is infamous, unfortunately didn't get to eat there as the queues were always long. The hotel concierge service is second to none, they were incredibly helpful in recommending restaurants aswell as booking our tickets for a tour. All in all a great place to stay if you can get a good room rate. The only tip I would give you is to avoid room service as works out very pricey, especially when there are many great places to eat nearby	
Oct 13 2009 	NEVER AGAIN	I have stayed at the hotel for almost 15 years and seen alot of changes, not all positive. Our last long weekend will sadly be our last at the property. The good location is all that remains of the old property.We had a terrible time arranging our rooms with the front desk staff. Without getting into all the details, the level of service has dropped to the point where the hotel doesnt even resemble the old property. The hotel has been remodeled and our room on the 36th floor was so small we had to be careful not to bang into the other furniture as we attempted to navigate our way to the bathroom. The bathroom so small even without a bathtub and my wife and I couldnt stand and get ready in at the same time. Dont plan on meeting in the lobby. It is cold, only small chairs available are very uncomfortable.	
Mar 12 2009 	Eat at Norma's Sleep Elsewhere	It was a whirlwind business trip and I only stayed one night but I was very disappointed. The room is small (not by NY standards but compared to the smaller W properties midtown which give you a lot more square footage for the same price) with two TWIN beds rather than double beds. The mattresses and bedding sagged and looked worn. The phone by the bed didn't work and the sheets had holes in them. The only saving grace is Norma's downstairs - really great food, always. If you want to pay around $350 you are better off at the W Court or Tuscany.	
Aug 13 2007 	Good location nice hotel	Got a great deal on hotwire and chose the hotel because of the proximity to central park. We didn't want to stay close to the crowds and this hotel was a nice quiet oasis.The lobby is small and there's no real gift shop (if you're into that). We were a little confused by our directions and had a difficult time finding the main entrance of the hotel. However, the multiple entrances are convenient when leaving to walk the city.It took us a while to find the burger place...very cool! It's located behind the giant curtain in the lobby. Follow the neon burger sign.Our room was located on the 21st floor. The room was small, but sufficient. We had a fantastic view of the park. I noticed that the other rooms around us we're much larger...would've loved to have had one of those.The tv's in the elevators were a nice touch. My daughter loved watching &quot;her movie&quot; in the elevator.You must visit the pool deck for a fabulous view of the city!!Overall, I think the hotel was great for the price we paid. It's not a luxury oasis, but good. It's less crowded than the large chains located closer to times square.	
Apr 19 2006	Love it!	Was very happy with the hotel. Room size was good and the $50 upgrade for the park view a must! The top floor pool a nice option and the full work out gym wonderful if staying more than one night...although you have to pay to use it. The only downside was the lack of a lounge/resturaunt for family dinner....wasn't impressed with the one they have. Norma's is a must for breakfast and the burger joint also a delight. I will definitely recommend this hotel to others.	
Jul 10 2005	Rooftop Makes This Special	This is really a unique hotel. On the plus side is the pool on the top floor, the sundecks with great views of Central Park, Normas for excellent (albeit expensive breakfasts), the Burger Joint (good, inexpensive burgers), and a phenominal health club. On the negative side was an uncomfortable sofa bed (yes, some people actually use these) and the concierges (2 of the 3 answers we got turned out to be wrong). I would still recommend this hotel.	
Mar 20 2005 	Great Experience	After reading other reviews for Le Parker Meridien in NYC, I was ready to bail on my reservations, but my instincts led me to hang in and give the Meridien a fair shake. And what a great decision that was.My husband and I loved our experience. Our room was large and comfortable and decorated with contemporary good taste. The staff was polite, friendly and helpful and breakfast at Norma's..the restaurant located off the lobby...was incredible...for the first time, we ate twice in our hotel; something we normally do not do. Breakfast is the best, but don't miss the burgers from the Burger Joint..a small sports bar type grill just off the lobby. Amenities for business travelers are solidly in place as well as for pleasure travelers, and just for giggles, there's classic cartoons playing in the elevator.I'll be coming back alone on business as well any pleasure trips. I give the Meridien both thumbs up.Happy Campers...Louisville, Kentucky	
Sep 8 2004	Great hotel	This is probably the best all around hotel in New York. Great for families, great for those who want amenitites and great for business travelers and tourists. For me this is the ideal hotel in New York because I need to have a large flat screen TV with a DVD player in my room, plus a CD player. Also, I need a super comfortable bed and the beds at this hotel are the most comfortable I have ever slept on. All this for a relatively affordable rate. I payed $199 for the night and it was a good value, especially for New York. Also, the location is just about perfect for me. Within steps from one of my favorite restuarants in the city(Rue 57-located on the corner of 57th St.and 6th Ave.) and so very close to Central Park and 5th Ave. So with the amenities, the location and the price(if you can get the $199 rate), it's the perfect hotel in New York for me. Other hotels with a DVD player in the rooms go for around $400 or more a night and some don't even have a large flat screen TV! While this hotel has 35 inch ones. Plus, some of them don't have a swimming pool like Le Parker Meridien does. The pool is a great feature of this hotel which is located on the 42nd floor on the roof. You can see great views of Central Park and the surrounding city in your bathing suit, which is a unique thing for the city. Le Parker Meridien gets the award for the best all around hotel in New York.Even if I could afford to stay at more expensive hotels, I'm not sure if I would want to because the locations of those other hotels are not quite as good plus the beds may not be quite as comfortable. Thus, Le Parker Meridien is a unique hotel in a very positive way, despite the bland bathrooms and room decor.	
Sep 8 2003	A Peaceful Oasis	My friend and I got a great rate on Priceline to stay here two nights Sept. 5-7. I had a terrible cold and had to spend a lot of time sleeping during our trip. The beds are SO comfortable--I have never slept so well in a hotel bed. In our two-bed room the beds were double-sized. We loved the look of the rooms--sort of Japanese modern with wood and olive trim. We called ahead and requested a room with a bathtub.Our room was located on the sixth floor, which I anticipated being dark. But it was actually just fine--about one-third of our window view was sky, so we had nice sunlight.The hallways are so cool--they are dimly lit with the room numbers glowing in cobalt blue.I want to stay here every time I visit--our room was such a pleasure to rest and relax.	
Oct 24 2009 	Fabulous	Lovely little hotel with lots of character. Conveniently located for everything. Had a brilliant time, would recommend. We booked a deluxe room, it was big enough for 2 with a good sized desk for working. Roof top bar is great and the restaurant below is really nice	
Apr 21 2009 	Don't Stay Anywhere Else!	I stayed in the Library Hotel for a week in mid April with my 12-year old daughter. It was our first trip to New York - and her first trip to the USA. We loved the hotel. The reception staff were very helpful and gave us tips on where to go. Make sure you ask for the shopping maps and the discount vouchers! The Reading Room was a great place to go at any time of day and we loved the breakfasts. The 14th floor was wonderful too. The housekeeping service was fantastic and we liked our &quot;weather forecast&quot; - brought to the room each evening as part of the turn down service. If you want an evening in, you can simply pop down to reception and borrow a dvd from their huge selection. On top of all this, the hotel has a fantastic location. Most attractions - and many, many shops - are an easy walk or short subway ride away. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel. If I go back to New York, I know where I will be staying.	
Feb 15 2009 	Excellent Boutique Hotel	Arrived at JFK, walked out of the terminal and got the bus to Grand Central Station. Arriving at GCS, you literally turn around, walk away from GCS, take the next right and its 1 block up on your right hand side. So easy.Hotel check in was done with ease and staff very friendly and informative. Got the dinosaur room which I think is a Junior Suite on the 5th floor. Room is cosy and well decorated. There's a built in wardrobe, TV, DVD player, mini bar, hairdryer, shower, toilet etc. They provide the shampoo and shower gel. On arrival in the room, there is a bottle of sparkly waiting. Nice touch. Handwritten notes from turndown service gives you information on what the weather is doing the next day. They even leave a chocolate behind for each of us.Included in the hotel cost is breakfast which includes bagels, bread, fruit, cereals etc. This is not included in many hotels in NYC so this is a bonus. Complimentary wine, cheese and biscuits on the 2nd floor everyday between 5 and 8 is very nice and all in a lovely surrounding. They 14th floor has a bar and balcony.When it rains they have umbrellas for you to borrow. DVD's are yours to borrow for the night if you are stuck for things to do.The hotel is in an ideal location (2 mins from Grand Central Station) where you can get the subway to Battery Park, Brooklyn Bridge etc. Hotel is situated on Madison Avenue where all the nice shops are. Easy to walk to Times Square, Empire State Building, 5th Avenue, Madison Avenue. All around 10 min walk. Located (I think) centrally to all the usual tourist sites.Bear in mind when booking the hotel room, you can't pay for it at the time. It did cost us an extra £500 from booking it to paying for it as the exchange rate dived!! Neither the less, it is all worth it.	
Sep 7 2008 	good location but not as expected	We booked a 4 night stay at the Library Hotel over our wedding anniversary but were very disappointed. The hotel itself is fine - the rooms are clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. It didn't however have the wow factor we had expected from the reviews and website. Our room - one of the most expensive in the hotel - was very small and dark, our 'library' with philiosphy books contained about 12 titles. When compare to other hotels of similar price in the area i had expected more. If you're looking for somewhere to crash out while exploring new york i think this would be a good choice - the location is excellent - but if you're looking for something a bit special then i'd stay elsewhere.	
Feb 12 2008 	New Yorks Gem	Long before we arrived at the hotel, our questions were being answered promptly via email. On arrival at the Library Hotel, we were met by extremely helpful reception staff, who not only take pride in their hotel but are keen to promote NY on the whole. The room was spotlessly keen, had everything we needed and more and was remarkably quiet considering the constant city traffic that was ever present outside.The breakfast set us up for the day and the hotel staff were keen to advise on what to see, how best to get around and to suggest various places to eat.Booking tickets for events was never too much trouble and we had the best seats in the house at Carnegie Club on Saturday Evening.All in all, we are more than happy to write this review, recommend the hotel and look forward to visiting again.	
Nov 22 2008 	Tried very hard to like this place	On previous trips while staying at another 5 star property in town, I kept finding myself at The Time Warner center for dinner, drinks, walks in the park etc. Therefore , I thought, why not try it out?While there were no disasters, and nothing particularly bad about the hotel, it came across as dissapointigly average. The park views were terrific. The service was friendly. But the overall experience feels more like a convention Hyatt. There's nothing wrong with that, but its very dissapointing if you are expecting a five star experience. That fifth star is all in the details, and thats what the hotel lacks. From the service, to the finishes in the rooms. Most of the problems come from the building itself. Even though the hotel is only a couple hundred rooms, you definitely feel like you're in a massive structure. And everything, from the spa to the business center feels like its miles away, down random corridors. For example, the entrance to the gym is located just outside a ballroom area: so at best, you have to walk through a dark empty banquet area with a piano covered in the corner, but I couldn't help thinking of the alternative if the room were in use, which would be making your way through a black tie affair in your sweaty workout clothes. One afternoon I returned to my room to find the maid cleaning the room, but noticed she had the TV turned on and was watching a soap opera. Little things like this give the impression there is very little oversight of the smaller details by management. The area rug in the lobby has an ugly rubber band around it like an airport would have, and the tile and fixtures in the bathrooms, while attractive, look cheap and institutional. The rooms have an office-chic feel to them, like a first class airport lounge. Nothing wrong with that, but certainly not the height of luxury one might expect.	
Oct 14 2006 	Too expensive for what it was....	I booked a Hudson River View Deluxe Room over the phone for a rate of approx $900 per night. The room itself was beautiful, quiet with glorious views across to the river. The bathroom was huge, with its own flatscreen TV by the bath and a refreshing &quot;waterfall&quot; shower. The corridors and public spaces were gloomy and the main bar was so dark my husband nearly tripped going down the stairs to our table. The restaurant Asiate had great food, and the hotel concierge was extremely helpful. The pool was large but a little chilly, though this isn't a problem if you are a serious swimmer. Annoyingly, you have to pay for Internet access and the room services prices are astronomical. We ended up buying dinner one evening from the great deli in the Columbus Circle downstairs to eat back in our room! Our fellow guests were mainly Russian &quot;businessmen&quot; and unfriendly Europeans.In summary, the hotel has the prices of the Four Seasons, but doesn't have the understated and welcoming chic of the Four Seasons.	
Apr 5 2004	mixed feeling about this hotel	My husband and I love this hotel chain in general. We've actually stayed at the San Francisco one and the Miami one in the last six months. The new york one is gorgeous, but the drawbacks to this hotel is likely related to the fact that it is in new york. The rooms in SF and Miami were spacious and gorgeous.. The room we had in NY was small but still well decorated. The location of our room (near some service area where room service carts kept entering and the door kept slamming) was lousy. We were also at the end of a hallway where there were literally 4 other hotel room doors outside our door and no noise insulation, and our neighbors felt very comfortable slamming those doors around. For 600+ a night, this is not quite what I had in mind. Yes, NYC is crowded and real estate is at a premium, but I had expected more from the Mandarin Oriental. We still love this hotel chain, but the new york city one didn't achieve the level of comfort that the other ones did.	
Apr 1 2009 	Best Hotel Experience	I was quite hesitant about staying at the millenium hotel downtown in lieu of the fact that thousands died across the hotel on September 11th. After my initial apprehension I went ahead and booked the rooms from 27th -30th of March. The rates were unbelievable, $109 per night $384 including all taxes and fees. We arrived at the hotel during rush hour on Frday, that did not deter us from receiving a warm welcome as well as the fastest check in I ever experienced. Our King size room was on the 52nd floor of the hotel. We chose a city view at the time of booking which we received at time of check in. The elevator to our floor took less than 15 seconds. It was so fast my ears popped everytime I rode the elevator. Our room was perfect. The 42 inch TV was right across the bed. Enough channels including HBO, which was a delight because I was able to watch sex and the city(the movie). I drew the curtains to the best view in the world. The world trade center construction site was at the bottom and I felt in a weird way part of history because I was witnessing the construction of the symbol of modern day America and all that it represented. It was not till later in the local news that I realized the name of the tower had been changed from Freedom tower to World Trade Center 1. i'm not sure i have an opinion on that, I will let New yorkers decide. After admiring our impeccable room we ventured out to the Witer Garden across the construction site, we were dissapointed in the choice of restaurants in the vicinity. The best place to have breakfast without breaking your wallet is the Whole foods on Murray and Greenwhich ST. Best breakfast ever, they have a breakfast station serving omelettes, pankakes, french toast and everything else you can imagine. I recommend lunch and dinner as well. The hotel is walking distance to Battery Park (waterfront) as well as the pier 17 and Southstreet Seaport (brooklyn Bridge can be viewed from some of the rooms in the hotel as well as the elevator lobby on all floors).The hotel has easy acess to subway A E and C lines which can take you to the uptown area. I am so glad I did not stay in the midtown area, too touristy and crowded. The downtown area has a very sophisticated feel almost like uptown. I was very sad to leave, this was by far the best vacation and hotel stay I have ever had.	
Jun 15 2009 	Wow! You've got to stay here!	This hotel was fantastic! I've stayed at other hotels in Times Square before and this one is by far the best one. When we checked in they got us an incredible room on a higher floor at a corner which meant that we had great views. It was also a great size and we had more than enough space. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The concierge (Erik) was awesome and recommended one of the best Italian restaurants we had ever eaten in (Tramonti Ristorante). The concierge was very helpful with directions and even printed instructions for subways, etc. The room was extremely clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. We were just steps from all of the life of Times Square. We plan a visit later this year and will definitely stay at this hotel again! :)	
Nov 13 2007	Great Location Good Size Rooms Needs Some Updates	Staying at the Broadway Millenium for business. Received a corner room on the 37th floor overlooking Times Square. Check in was efficient and I was quickly up to my room. Overall, the hotel is showing its age. Nicks, scratches, scrapes, missing paint, crusty vents, and stains on carpet throughout. Nothing too major, but just those little things that tell you the hotel isn't exactly as &quot;fresh&quot; as it could be. Room was good size for NYC, view was fantastic. Street noise, even 37 floors up was quite pronounced. While you didn't hear the garbage trucks, you did hear constant traffic. Bed was quite firm, and what's up with only one sheet and a bedspread without a blanket, comforter, or some sort of thicker bed covering (I don't trust bedspreads in general due to the fact that they are rarely washed. When was the last time you saw a housekeeping cart with fresh bedspreads on it?) Lamps and other items in the room were all showing their age. Overall, for the price paid and the location, it's not a bad stay at all. It just doesn't rank up there with the top of the mix. It's more of the Sheraton/middle of the road quality with a great location along side the glitz and glamour of Times Square.	
Nov 2 2009 	Loved the surroundings; Hotel just okay	The hotel was in a quiet residential-like area that provided great views. The walk from the closest subway station was not far and was perfectly safe. There are a lot of good choices to eat and drink from nearby on 2nd or 3rd Avenue. The views from my room were magnificent. Pros: big rooms with plenty of room for your bags, laptop, shopping items. Large walk in style closet with in room safe, iron and lots of hangers. Bathroom was big and counter top had extra room for storing personal items. Housekeeping did a great job accomodating my &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door and did a very nice job. Beds were very comfortable. Storage space for clothes seemed adequate. TV was large but I only had it on while I was getting ready for work in the morning. Cons: hard to get a cab right outside the hotel at times - there were always taxis there in the early morning but afternoon and evening were difficult. There were often long lines waiting for the taxi. The couple of times I needed one, I just walked up to 2nd Ave and caught one with no problem but if you like to catch one right outside the hotel you might have a long wait. The bathroom also had a full wall mirror right next to the toilet - jeez - i don't want to have that view in the corner of my eye! Staff weren't exactly rude but they weren't helpful at all. Checkin and Checkout staff were flustered by long lines and didn't smile or go to any trouble to ask how you were or how your stay was. One of my personal things that i hate is not being able to control the room temperature - this room was HOT all the time. Even though I had the heat off it still came on and since the windows were screwed shut there was no good way to cool the room off. I spoke to two people who told me that it was best they could do (which was nothing).Since the only thing that really bothered me was the heat in the room, I would consider that a minor inconvenience and I would definitely return. My room was on the 28th floor which seemed new and not worn at all. I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it.	
Jun 3 2009	Millennium UN Plaza - Not a memorable Memorial Day Weekend stay	While the staff at the Millennium UN Plaza Hotel in New York City was first rate, the same could not be said of the recent ? renovation. Our room was in the supposedly updated section of the two tower hotel, but clearly the update was done on the cheap. The bedroom was under-furnished for its size, while the TV was too large for the room, and the artwork too spare and inappropriate. The room's HVAC also did not seem to have been updated as it was somewhat noisy and the thermostat did not work properly. Then there were the mirrors; THREE in the bathroom but not one in the bedroom. Very odd. Also for the price there should have been a coffee maker in the room.And while the room was clean, it just didn't seem like anybody really cared about how it looked or if it were really comfortable. The room just seemed cold and unfinished.It also appeared that, after the renovation, they hadn't gotten around to replacing the floor coverings in the hallways of our floor (which was the 33rd). The carpets were badly buckled and patched with dark tan duct/carpet tape. It really looked awful when you got off the elevator; not a good first impression at all.Would we stay there again? Despite the fantastic view, sorry, no.	
Oct 4 2008 	Worst bed ever - otherwise okay hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Millennium UN Plaza for 5 nights in Sept. We arrived one day earlier and had no trouble booking an extra night at 2330. The hotel from the foyer was nice and the staff were very friendly. The corridors were a bit drab and the carpet looked old and dirty. The room however looked nice and we had a view of the Hudson River. My main reason for booking this hotel was due to the view and the size of the rooms. The room was much smaller than I expected.The location was okay 2 blocks from Central station and the subway is on the Times Square lineMy biggest issue with the Millennium Un Plaza and the reason why I would never stay there again was the bed. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed that i have ever slept on. It squeaked really loudly with any weight on the bed. I left New York with a very sore back.	
Aug 11 2008 	Solid choice in Midtown East	We only stayed for one night and did not use a lot of amenities, so I am not able to comment on the WiFi internet availability, etc.The staff at check in was very courteous and we were given an upgrade to a suite. The suite was two level and we had huge windows on both levels with the views of the river and the boroughs. The carpet was worn and overall the hotel can use the makeover in the hallways and the rooms. The elevators were working fine and the hotel did not seem to be overrun with people. There were always cabs available outside the hotel and the bellhops were very friendly. We stored our luggage there the next day and they don't charge for this service (unlike some other hotels in Manhattan like Hilton on Ave of Americas). The checkout was very smooth. We used express checkout on the TV and then just dropped off the keys in the lobby. The entire process only took 5 minutes and there was never a long line in the lobby to see the reception staff or the concierge.I very likely to return to the Millennium UN Plaza especially if we get the same great rate through hotwire. Overall value for price ACheck-in process AQuality of service BQuality of bed, furniture CRoom cleanliness BCondition of TV &amp; lights C	
Jan 28 2008	2nd Time around GREAT!	Wow...Great value for the hotel and location. Quiet and great weekend get away....Ran the NYC half Marathon great place to crash..before the race with my wife. Room ok but the view of the empire state building and downtown with the east river...Priceless.	
Mar 28 2006	pURE DEAD bRILLIANT	A group of 36 off us stayed at this hotel, and not one person had anything bad to say, the place was out of this world, i mean the swimming pool on the 27th floor was great and the view even better, the rooms were very nice and big, all the staff were friendly and couldnt do enough to help whenever you needed any help, all in all i recommended to everyone, and if i get the chance i'll be back.	
Sep 12 2005 	Good View Insulting Service Bad Maintainence	The view are incredible and it hosts numerous visiting diplomates.I have stayed here a few times because of its convenience to the UN, but the cost and faxt it falling apart and the staff more greedy then they are civil makes this visit my last for sometime. First several things in the room did not work such as the sink in ther bath tub, the high speed internet, the bath room light. The King bed was nice, but they used Queen size sheets on it? Second in the gym not only was some of the gym equipment not working, but the pool had been declared a health hazard by the Department of Health! And this is a five star hotel...abet in NYC where the stars are for dollars, not quality.The Ambassador Grill resturant is medium quality with a high-priced Sunday brunch that is about fifty bucks a person. The beef was chewy and tastless, possibly from having been out too long. The salads limited and not alaways fresh. The best items were the usual breakfast items that you can go to for five bucks in a dozen cafe's within walking distance. To add insult to injury the waiters add their own 20% tip to bill...after taxes!The front door staff seemed preoccupied, perhaps waiting for famous diplomats. One doorman opened the taxi door for me then disappeared leaving me at the curb with two large suitcases. The Concierge seem well informed when I asked him about a post office, but offered to get me Broadway tickes for three times the price saying the show was sold out when we got tickets for the same show, the same night at the half-price ticket booth in Times Square.While I was mesmerized by the view, I was utterly disgusted by the service, the food, and the facilities. Nevertheless, the view could make this place a good choice if that is all you are looking for...unfortunately I was looking for more.	
Dec 21 2004	Great stay!	I read about the Millennium UN Plaza on this site before my husband and I went to NYC for the Holiday Season experience (12/9 thru 12/16/04). I obtained a lot of accurate information from this site. The hotel room's view was unbelievable. We could see the UN building, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building from our window (which opened for great photos). Bathroom lighting was exceptionally bright, which I appreciated. Rooms are nice size for NYC. Room was too warm for us, but hotels are often too warm. It was a very safe area. Never felt afraid on the nearby streets. Took the advice of several people who posted notes about John's Cafe a block away from the hotel. We ate breakfast there 6 of our 7 days stay. Reasonably priced, good hearty breakfasts. --- By far one of the highlights was Maria, who was friendly and efficient while she waited ALL the tables in the restaurant.One person on TripAdvisor mentioned smoke odor coming thru the bathroom vent. It did smell, but was not unbearable, this from an ex smoker. We are pickier than non smokers about smoke smell. But it would be an improvement if they could remedy that odor.All in all, it was a great place to stay.	
Feb 12 2004	Great base for all attractions	We have just got back today from a four night stay in this Top notch hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpfull. As it was my birthday whilst we were there we were given a corner room overlooking the east river, Queens and Brooklyn. It was amazing in the morning to wake up and watch the sun come up over the skyline, then nip down to the swimming pool to have a dip then relax in the sauna before the days onslaught of things to do. The local Johns cafe was all we had read about, with friendly service and cheep food. there was also a 24 hour deli who would deliver to your room, and no one will bother you if you have things delivered. For english people the subway can be confusing as you have to make sure you enter the right platform when using a all day pass, because we not only once but 2-3 times got onto the wrong platform and were then locked out for the next 18 mins. As has been said befor dont touch the mini bar or snack basket, but also we would advise that you sort out your mobile phone as the phone calls from the hotel are expensive. but this is normal for hotels. If you are looking for a secure hotel you cant get any better than this. with being a stones throw from the UN building all the stops have been pulled out to keep the area safe. We did a lot of walking, but Taxis are cheep and plentifull, and just think of hailing one down on times square before going back to relax in the hotel. Cant wait to be able to afford to go back to this hotel again.	
Jan 14 2008 	Fantastic Location	The Moderne hotel is a wonderful find. The location is brilliant, very central and right round the corner from Time Square. The room was very clean, huge bed which was nice too. The guestrooms have everything you need, not too big not too small and very reasonably priced too.The (free) coffee room on the 1st floor was made good use of everyday. Staff are also very friendly and helpful.One downfall is that there was alot of static in the rooms - nylon carpet i expect but friends say this is the case in even the most expensive NYC hotels so there is not alot you can do about that i guess.All in all a great place to stay in NYC, highly recommended for those on a budget.	
Jul 10 2004	Worst ever hotel	Worst hotel. Room smelt of ciggerates and paint, repair work and maintaince work going on. drilling was heard. Very awful substandard hotel. refused to stay here so checked out the same day. Did not even sleep here.	
Aug 1 2009 	Very good value for money in NYC	I wasn't expecting very much seeing that we didn't pay a very big fee, but I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. We booked a large double bedroom and found that it had more than enough space for our luggage.The rooms are simple but that is to be expected. The bathroom was better than I expected which was good (I made sure we had our own private one, there's no way I would be able to share). There were also quite a lot of tv channels available which was good for when we were knackered from walking around all day. There is no elevator, but I just made my hubby carry my luggage up and down the stairs. The hotel is in a good location. We walked to and from Times Square a few times, but also made use of the subway which was nearby (however, only a few trains stop at this station).The only thing that was a negative was the fact that the rooms didn't feel too safe. Our room had a standard door knob with a simple lock on it, which would be easy to kick or shoulder in if somebody wanted to. However, we locked all our valuables away and didn't have any trouble. If they added a more sturdy handle/lock or something it'd feel a bit safer.But overall, good value for money in NYC and we were quite pleased with it. I would stay there again (if I didn't have a bigger budget for a hotel upgrade).	
Apr 12 2008 	You get what you pay for	I used to live in NYC and sometimes I wish I still had my apartment. So I will say that you get what you pay for with this hotel. The Murray Hill Inn is a very bare-bones basic hotel so we weren't expecting ther Four Seasons - especially for under $200/night. We needed a relatively inexpensive room for two nights to attend a wedding in NYC. So we booked a queen bedroom w/private bath and the room was on the 4th floor facing the street. Here's the bad news: The hotel has NO elevator so be prepared to walk up and down a lot of steps if you're on an upper level. Some small things: The blinds on both windows in our room were broken, and the windows didn't stay open on their own. The alarm clock was broken and the time was wrong. We tried to reset it but to no avail. And some of the buttons on the remote control for the TV were broken and the remote itself had a different room number on it. And I didn't see an A/C although it being April, we thankfully didn't need one. Check with the hotel to see if they do have A/C if you're staying in the warmer months. The good news: The front desk staff were very nice and let us check into the room early and they held our bags after check out before we went back to the airport. The hotel is in an excellent and convenient location on a semi-quiet tree-lined block in Murray Hill. The rooms were clean and our bathroom was very nice. Basics included a closet with hangers and an ironing board w/iron and a hair dryer and toiletries. You can pay for wireless internet service. I think it was $7.00 per 24 hour usage.I wouldn't recommend this place for people who don't do stairs very well or who want luxury or extreme quiet. It's more like staying in someone else's cheap apartment who lives in the city but if you're just needing a place to sleep and shower, it's not too bad.	
Jul 5 2009 	Très bien situé mais chambre très très petite....		
Oct 9 2007	Nice Place With a Wonderful View	I spent at the NY Marriott Financial Center a couple of nights when rushed from SoBe to NYC for Justine Timberlake concert at Madison Square Garden. I decided to stay by the river in South Manhattan, and my choice wasnt wrong. Ive got no one word of critics on this hotel and can only numerate its positive sides. Its staffs are professional and friendly and their service is very good. Its very well located on the West Street going along the Hudson River, near Battery Park, so this hotel got wonderful views of New York Harbor with Ellis and Liberty islands. Sounds good, yeah? Its very close to subway station (Rector Street) at Trinity Place, so in some minutes youre able to get any place of the city. A ride by cab from the hotel to somewhere around the 42nd street or back would cost near 15 bucks with tip.  Its at walking distance (5-7 minutes) from the Broadway at Wall Street which is too convenient in case youre on business trip.  Its neighborhood is very quiet and not overcrowded in comparison with the city center. Its cheaper than the other Marriott hotels situated in the city center, but it provides customers with the same service. That means that the hotel got an appropriate price-quality ratio.Finally, it has the restaurant, indoor pool and gym, and there is a Starbucks café in the same building. The check in took only some moments and I got a standard Marriotts room with all the necessary amenities, traditionally comfy king bed and a nice view of the Hudson River and Jersey City. Besides a nice buffet breakfast, my accommodation plan included free cruise tickets around NY harbor with stops on Liberty and Ellis islands, two day-long subway tickets and two flyers for free admission to all the museums in South Manhattan - nothing special but very pleasant.  After a quick check out, I caught a cab to the JFK  in a couple of minutes we crossed the East River through Brooklyn Bridge when rushed to Queens and got the airport very quickly (not wasting a lot of time in Manhattans traffic jams). Oh, that JFK! We spent two hours crawling for take off in a line of hundreds of aircrafts, but this is another story. All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend anyone to stay at New York Marriott Financial Center.	
Jul 21 2009 	Huge Hotel at great location - in the middle of Times Square	We stayed at the Marriott Marquis for 4 nights in July 2009.Chose it because of the location. Originally we had booked a hotel on Park Avenue but then re-decided because we wanted to be right in the middle of everything.Overall:We were satisfied with our stay and did not have mayor complaints. Marriott fulfilled our expectations since we knew what to expect. Years ago we had a look into the lobby so we knew its huge.Postive:LOCATION - LOCATION - LOCATION !Marriott Marquis is right on Broadway / Times Square. You just step out of the doors and you are in the middle of action. The Grey Line Tour buses start 2 minutes walk up broadway and the next subway station is 5 minutes to the other direction.Although the hotel looks ugly from the outside (80's style) it is very well maintained.Rooms are big and beds comfortable. Aircontion worlked perfectly and is silent, this is most important for us - we hate these window aircos making a lot of noise.We booked a times square view room on high floor and got a room on 35 floor with breathtaking view.Breakfast buffet was included in our rate (25 dollars surcharge per room compared to room only) and it was really worth it. Huge and good buffet -warm and cold selection. Nice restaurant on 8th floor - lobby level.There is a starbucks on 8th floor and one on street level if you just prefer to have coffee.The lobby shop offers stamps for postcards and letters. Staff there was really nice and helpful.Broadway bar on 8th floor has great view on Broadway and cocktails were very good.The lobby is really impressive, located on 8th floor it is open till 45 floor and you can see the glass elevator going up and down.Negative:There are only some minor issues to be mentioned.The bathroom looks a bit dated, but water pressure was OK and amenities offered are nice.It would be perfect if the hotel would offer a pool, especially in summer.At one night the Broadway bar was closed due to a private event, only the lobby bar without view open.SummaryAs i mentioned, do not expect any charm, the hotel is huge and the lobby has the atmosphere of a big train station.If you are looking for personal attention of staff or charming atmosphere you will not like this hotel.If you want to be in the middle of New York Action, do not fear thousands of people and want a good bed and perfect and silent air-condition, you will love this hotel.	
Jun 30 2009 	We had a great experience at Marriott Marquis NYC	Great Location, nice large room, King bed. My son thought the elevators were like an amusement park ride. The staff was helpful and attentive. I would stay here again when traveling with my son	
Jun 16 2009 	Credit Card Guarantee Means Nothing	We arrived in New York Late Tuesday and were only staying 2 nights. I researched hotels in Times Square and selected the Marriott Marquis based on the reviews from Trip Advisor. My husband called the hotel to let them know our flight was a late one and to have them send a car to the airport to pick us up. We arrived at the hotel to check in only to be told that they did not have a room available. They had guest that wanted to extend their stay and gave them our room. I had printed out my confirmation that stated Credit Card Guarantee. Basically that really means nothing but had I not showed up at all my credit card would have been charged for the room that wasn't even available! We travel a lot and I have never had this happen ever!!	
Nov 2 2008	Wonderful hotel in the heart of New York	The Marriott Marquis is located in the heart of Times Square and is at the high end of Marriott's chain of accommodations and appointments. It is easily reached by subway or taxi, and entered through a breezeway beneath the hotel. Elevators lead up to the 8th floor where the main lobby is located (convention rooms fill the lower floors). The elevators are accessed by typing your destination on a master pad, which then directs you to an elevator that is programmed to take you to the floor. Efficient, but confusing to everyone looking for buttons to push.The staff at check-in is quick and efficient, although rooms were not available until 3 pm (people linger until noon before leaving). The room, on the 14th floor, was a corner room with a huge comfortable bed, large sitting area, and large bathroom. There weren't as many windows as might be expected, and there was a lot of wind noise. The room has a 'fridge, small mini-bar, flat-screen cable TV, and in-room coffee. There is wired internet access that keys to your computer, so if you have two machines in the room, you cant' swap the connection. The tub-shower is great, with good hot water and pressure.There are many good restaurants within easy walking distance, and convenience and package stores for drinks and snacks. &quot;Restaurant Row&quot; is a good destination for a wide variety of dining at reasonable prices, it is an easy two-block walk from the hotel. Many Broadway shows are similarly within a block or two, and the TKTS half-price office is just across the street at the center of Times Square.At checkout, allow a half hour for your bags to be transferred to the breezeway if you are ordering a cap. They take the bags in the lobby, and assume that you will linger before appearing to pick them up downstairs.This is a high-end property that is ideally located and appointed. The staff does a great job moving a large flow of people through the hotel, and is eager to help. Recommended!	
Sep 4 2008	A city in a city with great location	Stayed here for 3 nights while attending a conference in the hotel itself. This is a massive hotel - almost a city in itself. The lines at the check in desk can take very long (even for Marriott Rewards members). It can take up to 30-40 minutes for check in if you get there at a peak period.The location is great! The hotel sits in Times Square (and hence many Subway lines). The views from rooms on higher floors are amazing. The service is like any other Marriott. The rooms are large for NY standards. There are 3-4 restaurants and 2 Starbucks to choose from. The revolving restaurant on the top floor does not offer a particularly great view. I forgot my phone charger at the hotel. It was delivered free of cost by lost and found albeit after a slight delay.	
Apr 1 2009 	i love this hotel!	i just spent a week in new york with family at the palace hotel, and it was amazing! the location is absolutely perfect- walk to times square or central park. the hotel itself is very nice. our room was actually upgraded when we got there to the 37th floor, so you can imagine the beautiful city view that provided. the staff was always very helpful; we asked the concierge how to get around/where's what, and they were always happy to point us in the right direction. the bar/restaurant downstairs, gilt, has some amazing desserts and a really comfortable atmosphere. of course, my favorite part is probably the way the maid set out our slippers on little white rugs at the side of the bed for turn down :) all in all, great place to stay!	
May 20 2008 	Super Super Super!!!!!	Just returned recently from the New York Palace after a four night stay. The check in was quick and efficient. The rooms were fabulous. All lights could be turned off from the bed!! ( Very handy ! ). The bedrooms are beautifully decorated, spotless and have the most comfortable beds. On our first night a selection of fruit , cheese and a nicely worded birthday card was left for my husband as our visit was to celebrate his 40th birthday. Turn down service at night and the radio turned on playing soothing music was welcoming after a night out. The staff were very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble. Location is great, with fabulous shops a few steps away. The New York Palace is a fantastic place to stay. Book now , you won't be disappointed.	
Mar 20 2008 	Fantastic Palace	Just back from a long weekend over Paddy's day and this hotel is up there with some of the finest i have ever stayed in. The staff were all more than happy to help and always met us with a smile.The hotel is fantastically placed 1 block from 5th Avenue and about 5 mins from Central Park.Food was excellent, however, we preferred to eat out just to make the most of the trip.Great hotel but look around the web and see if you cant get it any cheaper than you find at first	
Feb 23 2008 	fairly expensive but totally worth it!	I was in New York for work, and stay at the Palace for 3 nights. Wonderful hotel. It is a bit more expensive than most, but totally worth it in my opinion. First - the location. My room had a view of St Patricks Cathedral, which was sunny and lovely every morning. That you can walk out onto 5th avenue and enjoy the best shopping in NYC is amazing! And it is a short walk to central park up 5th avenue. The room itself is well-appointed - large flat screen TV, the most comfortable bed you have ever slept in, and turn-down service with relaxing music and slippers next to your bed. A great touch! Rooms are quiet and you can't hear your neighbors, which is important. I reall enjoy having drinks at the bar there, since it is comfortable and the service is great. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the people helping with luggage are great to point out how to work all the amenities in the room. My room rate included breakfast, which you can order as room service at no extra charge which most people do not know. Breakfast was GREAT - toast and pastries, eggs, coffee, fresh juices, etc. When room service delivered they even opened my curtains so I could enjoy the sun. I know a deli is cheaper, but it is really luxurious to eat breakfast in bed after a long day! I highly recmommend the spa there as well.As for restaurants within walking distance - I really enjoy BLT steakhouse. And for drinks in a younger and more lively atmosphere with music, try the W hotel. The hotel is definitely close enough to walk to times square if you want to catch a broadway show, but if you are wearing heels like I do it is a quick and easy cab ride - the hotel does a great job of keeping a long que of taxis at your beck and call. Try the Palace!	
Jan 18 2008	Best Hotel in NY city	This is the best hotel in New York City (of course, I've never stayed at any other hotel in NY before so I guess my opinion is very narrow)However, just walking through the beautiful courtyard and lobby every night when returning from the bustle of the city is worth the extra cost. Rooms are huge and the turndown service is an added bonus. Restaurant was decent but not the greatest (it was part of the package so I had no real qualms).EVERY FIRST TIME NEW YORKER SHOULD STAY HERE as it is the perfect location ideally situated to all Midtown touristy areas. After staying here, you will realize that Rockefeller is the REAL heartbeat of New York (not Times Square).	
Jan 29 2009 	Loved the Night	Ok, lets start with the obvious - the rooms are small! Right that's out the way.The hotel is great - location, vibe, decor etc etc. The staff were very friendly and I think it's down to the fact its a 70 odd room hotel so you've got the personal touch as they're not dealing with hundreds of rooms. We even saw one of the guys from reception out of the hotel and he recognised us &amp; said hello! Breakfast was a nice touch and really set us up for the day. Eggs, cheese, bagels, yoghurt &amp; granola so a pretty good choice. Back to the room. It was small but the sheets &amp; bed were really comfy. Personally I didn't travel to NY to spend all my time in my room so with all the walking &amp; fresh air it was great finish the day on nice bed. The bathroom again small had everything in it. My only slight niggle is that the glass screen didn't cover the whole shower so you tended to get the floor wet. Reception booked us a car to get back to the airport which was around $60 but well worth it and more comfy. The Irish bar over the road Connollys was nice. Nice food &amp; they do live music. It was nice to stop there for a final drink on the way back. So all in all was i value for money yes, a nice hotel yes &amp; importantly would I go back - YES!	
Aug 24 2007 	Great Location!	Myself and my partner stayed here for a week from Aug 15th to Aug 22nd.We had never stayed in a &quot;Boutique Hotel&quot; before,so we weren't too sure what to expect.We were very pleased.From the very outset,the staff were very friendly and courteous.They always had a smile and a hello every time we passed the desk.This is my 5th time in NYC,and by far the nicest hotel I have stayed in.The location is perfect,just minutes walk from Times Square.Three lovely,clean Irish pubs right across the street(being Irish myself.....perfect!!).The food was also excellent in these pubs.I would definately stay here again.The huge plasma TV had all the channels you could need.A perfect place for couples.	
Aug 23 2009 	Great view on Time Square	We enjoyed this hotel for 5 days: at 300m from time square (52street, Broadway) , excellent view from our bedroom, and from the big breakfast room.Inside the hotel, everything is clean and not oldish, in the opposite of many other hotels in this city.You can't hear the noise from street (because this is not time square yet) , but our room wasn't quiet because you can hear your neighbours. Anyway, the bed was really comfortable, the room was big, well furnished, the staff was very quick to repair our AC, the reception desk was billingual (French and English)... so you are sure to relax at this hotel.Be careful, everything is really nice there but your credit card may suffer a bit !	
Jul 6 2009	Novotel New York	Spent 4 nights, 5 days in New York and stayed at Novotel. Booked Standard twin bedded room which turned out to be twin double bedded room with ensuite. Very clean, comfortable beds, bathroom with bath and shower great. The Hotel staff were very friendly and were happy to help with anything, nothing too much trouble. Very courteous and polite. The location was safe and 50 metre walk to Times Square. Did not eat at Hotel but used local outlets, loved the fresh fruit breakfasts. Found portion sizes enormous so my daughter and I often only ordered one meal with two plates. The city is very safe environment, many Police and security visible on the streets. Used the subway, not great as found it dirty and very basic no comparision to London Underground system, but cheap way to travel about, from Times Square to Statue of Liberty on subway $4.50 for two which is equal to approx £3. Loved all the shops naturally, designer clothing is a little cheaper however in Maceys and Blomingdales they have lots of offers. Get a visitor card from both stores which gives you an additional 10 per off the price including sale items. You need a form of id like passport or driving licence to get the discount card. Will definitely go again. Flew with BA comfortable no hassel flights both ways. Meals on board were o.k. Can Recommend Hotel and would definitely go back.	
Jun 15 2009 	Great hotel - will be coming back!	I just returned from 2 nights at Novotel and it was fantastic. This was a last minute trip - price was right, staff was freindly and helpful, location was perfect. Would definitely stay here again!	
Feb 22 2009 	Recommended great hotel great staff great location	My wife and I organised a surprise trip here in January for my sons' 18th birthday and we loved it. Had two rooms on 26th floor looking out over the Hudson, the other side of the hotel looks out onto Broadway and Times Square. The staff were very friendly, the rooms were good and clean with large beds that were very, very comfortable. The food was excellent, fill up at the breakfast buffet and it keeps you going until dinner, and the restaurant looks onto Times Square.The hotel is in an excellent location, right in the theatre district, and is ideal for getting around and a lot of places can be reached on foot or on the subway if you don't feel like walking. Now we're looking forward until the next time we visit.	
Jul 9 2007	Great for Watching Thanksgiving Parade!	We wanted to get a &quot;parade-view&quot; room for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Macy's reps recommended Novotel and 2 others. We chose Novotel and were not disappointed. Staff was very, very nice and professional despite a very packed hotel on a very busy holiday weekend. We could view the parade from our room or on the 10th floor balcony of their restaurant which was also a great viewing spot. Room was small but that's typical for NYC. Would definitely use again!	
Mar 31 2007 	Novotel the view	Stayed at the Novotel 24th to 30th March. Excellent hotel for a sightseeing trip to New York Rooms have great view of Times square and Staff very friendly &amp; always willing to help. Hotel close to other attractions such as Empire State Central PArk etc and also close to subway. Be prepared for a Credit card meltdown when yoy visit all the shops on 5th Avenue!. Would almost certainly stay at this hotel when we return to New York.	
Jan 22 2003	Good value	This is a budget hotel that is clean, spacious and spartan. The block it is located on is industrial and graffiti strewn, but safe. The location is close to Greenwich Village, Little Italy, Soho, and convenient subway stops. The suites are clean and large by NY standards but the neighborhood can be noisy and there are NO amenities to speak of, i.e., forget about getting extra towels. The hotel staff is indifferent to friendly, but the hotel feels very safe as there is always someone at the entrance. Don't expect too much from this hotel; but you get your money's worth considering how inexpensive it is and the size of the suites.	
Apr 18 2008 	OK not great	While the Omni is an OK hotel, I really don't understand the wildly enthusiastic reviews. Our room was tiny, period. A person working at the desk had to get up and move out of the way for the other person to get qround the bed. The bathroom was tiny as well - barely enough room for one person's toiletries on the sink. The armoire - there wasn't a closet - was beat up, the TV was 1980s vintage, and the hotel overall was just a tiny bit shabby . In addition, there's an office building under construction behind the hotel and if you're unlucky enough to get a room on that side be prepared for construction noise from 7AM until 5PM during the week and from 9AM until 4PM on weekends. Noise from the hallway is intrusive, too. If you like taking a nap in the afternoon - like I do - too bad. The front desk was flat out rude when we asked for another room. While the food was good in the hotel restaurant, it's wildly expensive and one of the guys who waited on us was apparently operating on another planet. He took my wife's order, I said, &quot;I'll have exactly what she's having&quot;, and he brought us two completely different meals. Later heard him complaining to a co-worker about how he was mad becauase they made him work on Sunday. Concierge was generally pleasant, but appeared overworked and a bit harried. Bell staff were definitely harried and at times non-existent. On the plus side, the hotel is in the perfect spot for convenient touring and shopping. If you can overlook its minor annoyances it's an OK, but not great, place to stay in New york.	
Mar 22 2004	Look no further!!!	My daughter and I just returned from three glorious days in New York City. We stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place and loved every minute of it. I searched the net for one month, looking up possible hotel choices. Then found Tripadvisor. Read every review on loads of hotels I was considering. Found the Omni Berkshire Place and my decision was made up. You can't say enough about the place. It was immaculate, definitely upscale, large rooms, wonderful bathrooms, bright halls, attentive staff, serene lobby, and the best location for anyone that wants to walk to places like, Fifth Avenue shopping, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Radio City Music Hall, Broadway, Theaters, Central Park area, and much more. What else could I say. Best yet we got a wonderful deal by booking direct with the hotel. A non smoking room with two double beds, inner location (room with a view of Madison or Fifth Avenue would have run approximately $40.00 a night more) cost us around $210.00 per night and that included all applicable taxes. Would definitely stay at this hotel on my next visit. Last time I was in New York we stayed at The Ramada New Yorker for the same price. New Yorker wasn't even in the same league. Do yourself a favor and book early to get your best rate!!! Enjoy yourself, we did.	
Nov 16 2009 	Great location bedding not as good as previously.	I've been staying here since 2000 - if it's available, it's where I stay in NYC. Great location, great rooms (deluxe rooms, panoramic view, and minisuite are all comfortable - standard rooms are tiny). This visit is the first time I haven't been completely thrilled with the bed. Instead of the feather/down pillows I've gotten in the past, this time the bed pillows were filled with some sort of lumpy polyfill. I ended up using one of the decorator pillows to sleep.Also for the first time, noise from within the hotel was out of control. I didn't have any issues with street noise, even though I had two windows facing Broadway. People yelling in the hall, though?	
Jan 10 2009	Great location	Stayed at On the Ave for 2 weeks over the Christmas holiday season.Arrived in late at night to be greeted by cheerful check in staff.Room was fine on arrival and not as small as i had expected it to be. The bathroom was huge.The room I stayed in was on the 9 th floor and had no view but not any street noise apart from the occasionaly siren.Housekeeping were friendly when seen and stocked the bathroom well with towels. I didn't have a problem with house keeping.They did lack however a welcome book on the hotel like you get in all other hotels ( maybe it was missing).Also had an employee turn up to check the mini bar to see what was in it- stock taking. Didn't believe me when I told him we didn't have a mini bar in the room. He had to come in and look for himself. (Maybe this had been removed) he did alter his sheet with the room number on to say no mini bar.Don't pay for internet acess in the little business centre/room. I was able to pick up a Free wi fi singal and used that.The Manhattan dinner across the road is open 24 hours and does and okay breakfast. There is also a little supermarket called westside market that has everything you could need. I especially liked the fruit salad punnetts they had. THere is a ittle bakery open 24 hours does good food and hot drinks.Subway is easy to catch the number 1 train all the way.On the last night at midnight we did have a leak in our bathroom roof with water pouring onto the floor and down the mirror. Rung up and had someone there as soon as possible to clean it up along with the security guy who came to oversee things. They came back later with more towels for us than we needed.Would stay here again as great little area and easy walk to central park and even times square if you like walking.	
Jul 24 2006 	Great bedroom excellent value	I was not sure about booking this hotel after reading some reviews on this website, but I am glad that I did.I spent a week there and have not a single complaint to make about it! It was really good value: fantastic location, compact room but comfortable and clean and -most of all- very quiet, which for Manhattan is a great plus, helpful staff.It was probably the best hotel bed I have slept in!I have recommended this hotel to others and would definitely go back.	
May 4 2009 	pas mal :-)		
May 28 2009 	Magnificent Staff	This hotel is situated on a Quiet street within two blocks walk of two subway stations and close to many bus stops. The front desk staff are all very kind and helpful. The hotel provides free Wifi and morning coffee.The rooms are quite sufficient for the price. They are not attractive or large. They are clean and have all those bath goodies and even a shower cap, ironing board, hair dryer etc. The pillows were a bit lumpy. I will bring my own next time. The room doors are heavy so if a guest is a door slammer this may upset your generally kind nature.	
Feb 28 2009 	Great price; Good staff	The Park 79 offered a great price for a recent weekend stay in NYC. Although small, the room and bathroom was updated, clean and very serviceable. The staff were friendly and helpful -- highly recommended for an economical stay!	
Jul 17 2006	Good budget hotel	My husband and another couple stayed at the Park 79 hotel from July 8th - 11th and again from the 12th-15th.We chose this hotel because the room was a set price and it was a great deal for 4 people. Most other hotels I searched had no deal if two couples were sharing a room.The hotel was well located and the rooms were fine. We stayed in 2 suites while we were there. 518 had a tiny bathroom with a VERY dark shower. 418 had a full bathroom and was well laid out. If you are looking for a suite I would specifically ask for 418.The rooms were clean and the hotel was very quiet. I never heard other guests and the hotel was fully booked. The neighbourhood was great. We loved our daily walk by the museum of Natural History to the subway stop. Central park is also very close and there are tons of restaurants around. (I suggest Big Nicks on Amsterdam if you want a real crazy NY experience).The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the front desk service. We had to pay for the room upon check in (which I thought was bizarre) and once we checked out on the 11th the man working that morning was debating with me that I had not paid for the room. He kept me at the desk as he shuffled through papers trying to prove that I had not paid. I finally showed him my visa receipt and offered to phone Visa so he could hear from them that I had paid but he finally let me go! This was ridiculous and really wasted my time. I feel there were better ways to deal with this problem and that he was really not listening to his customer. I am a big believer in good customer service and this small experience really left a bad taste in my mouth.Overall I would recomend this hotel for its location and good price. If you want great service this isn't the place for you.L	
Feb 3 2005	Visitor from Chicago	We booked this hotel on line and the photos do not reflect the rooms. I went with a friend for a girls weekend and they gave us a room with one bed. We were able to change to a smaller room with two single beds but there was no heat and barely hot water. The toilet could only be flushed once an hour. We also learned that this hotel has been home to many people who are in NYC for medical treatements and live at the hotel while they are there. The building itself seemed to have potential and they were remodeling while we were there but overall it was just a place to crash. If you are looking to relax in your room this is not the place.	
Mar 4 2009 	Pleasantly surprised!!!	I stayed at the Park Central for 2 nights - Sunday and Monday. Check in was easy, staff was nice. Hotel was full of groups but nice and clean. The hotel is older which is evident in the halls. The room was bigger than expected. Very clean. Bathroom was big and clean. Nice ammennities. I was really happy. We had a double, double room. I will stay here again. It is perfect location across from Carnegie Hall and a block and a half from Letterman studios. Just a couple block from Times Square. Nice bar and nice restuarant in the lobby as well.	
Mar 1 2009 	Loved every min	I have just returned from staying in the Park Central hotel for 6 nights with my parents, this is my third time in New york and i would def go back and stay in this hotel it was perfect in everyway. When we arrived our room wasnt ready but we knew this might happen as it states this on their website that check in is frm 4pm so we just went next door to have a coffee in starbucks. When we got to our room it was perfect 2 nice size beds ,plasma tv, lovely clean bathroom coffee making facilites it was just perfect. Location was even better when you step out of the front door and turn to your right times square was hitting us in the face, we were only a 5 mins walk from there and if u turned left you were right into central park it was just perfect. We stayed on the breakfast package which saved us a fortune, you can have whatever you like from a hot breakfast to cereals, fruit, pastries, waffles, and juices. We also ate in the restaurant for dinner twice and both times the food was fantastic. There is nothing in this hotel that i could fault, the staff were very friendly and would help you out if you needed any info from sightseeing to eating out. If your looking for a central hotel thats always busy with people coming and going this is the perfect hotel for you.	
Jul 12 2008 	Great location for an average hotel!	My husband &amp; I just returned from a week in this hotel. I'll be honest after reading the latest reviews about this hotel I was TERRIFIED to stay at Park Central. I even looked into changing hotels the day before we left. Ultimately, I am glad that I didn't spend more money to stay somewhere else.We have stayed in NYC several times all in different hotels. We have stayed in one that was worse and stayed in better. I am a bargain vacation planner and I got a good deal on this hotel through Travelocity. If I had to do it again I'd probably try to find somewhere else for a similar price **only if** the location was as good as Park Central. This hotel is average. Our room wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews but it wasn't amazing either. The upside is that it really is in a GREAT location. If you go to NYC to spend time in the hotel I suggest staying somewhere else. If you want to go to NYC to be out and about in the city then this might be the place for you. The room provides an OK bed and decent size bathroom and room. Apparently, we were lucky and didn't have trouble with the elevators or maid service. The hotel served its purpose for our trip: somewhere to sleep, shower and get ready. I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. If you can get this hotel for a good price I'd say go for it...if not then try to find another hotel.We had good luck w/ the staff as well. We only had one employee that was rude to us. She was at the concierge desk and got VERY SNIPPY when I asked about tours at Ground Zero. It obviously hit a nerve with her. Her response was offensive to us because the 9/11 attacks effected all of us not just New Yorkers. She told me there are &quot;no tours and nothing to see there&quot; she told us that it was &quot;just a construction site&quot;. I thought it was disgraceful for her to say that because that site will never be 'just a construction site&quot;. FYI: There are walking tours provided through the 9/11 museum called &quot;Tribute&quot; . It is located on the south side of the site and we were VERY glad that we took the time to go!	
Feb 25 2008 	Amazing!!	Just returned back from staying 5 nights at The Park Central Hotel. I was a bit worried as i was checking trip advisor after i booked and there were loads of bad reviews, but i should never have worried. Hotel is fab, check in was very quick we arrived at about 4.30pm, i must admit the reception staff are miserable its like they are making a effort to be nice, but didn't worry me as long as the rooms were nice.We stayed on the 17th floor and had a great view of Times Square. Rooms were large, bathrooms on the small side but had a very powerful shower. Rooms were very clean and warm. we never ate or drank in the hotel so can't comment on these. The location of the hotel is fantastic, 5 minutes walk into times square a couple of minutes to central park and another 5 minutes to all the shops. would recommend going to Soho we only found it on our last day had great shops there. Would recommend the park central for anyone who wants to stay near broadway and times square.	
Feb 21 2007	Great base for NYC trip	Okay, so the front desk staff aren't as effusive as they might be, and the breakfast is a little limp, but the staff are helpful and professional when they have to be, and the rooms are spotless and the beds are supremely comfortable. For a week in NYC whether on business or pleasure, it's a great little place to come back to exhausted at the end of the day and just collapse in your room for a few hours, blast yourself under the power shower and then head back out again.Perfectly placed in the middle of Manhattan, right next to a subway line and yet just off the beaten track I'd recommend it and would definitely go back.	
Aug 25 2006 	Just OK	This hotel has its pluses and minuses and in the end, I'd say it met my expectations for the price range.On the plus side: very clean, recently renovated rooms, comfortable beds, quiet (and my room did overlook rooftops but not noisy at all), air conditioning worked well, luxury toiletries, good locationOn the minus side: Superior Queen room is TINY, no full length closet - just hooks on the wall and a half length pantry like cupboard, coffee makers on request only, only furniture for sitting is the desk chair or the bed - if you use the desk chair no one else can get around the room without you getting up - unless they cross over the bed!, housekeeping always forgot something - toiletries, towels, facecloths . . . front desk staff unapologetic and cool. Service was below average, no friendly welcome, no concierge.Ok for a short non-business stay.	
Jan 27 2008 	Gran Ubicación Limpio Seguro		
Sep 23 2007 	hotel ruidoso		
Jan 13 2009 	Barely Memorable and Definitely A Second Choice	No question, it has a great location on 5th and 55th and from my Grande Luxe room, a passable view up the Avenue but at $1175++ a night, somewhat steep for what was a comfortable but hardly spectacular room.Many hotels in NY lack public space but in this case, there is none at all and it feels dark and brooding and somewhat claustrophobic. There is no lingering here, door to stairs to elevator bank, which doesn't perhaps give the right feel.Room was comfortable, good bed and linens and all the thoughtful touches from the bedside control panel. Laundry and pressing service, prompt and excellent. Room service, also good and delivered hot food on time with a flourish.Breakfast in Fives, quite good but it's not a compelling setting, and lacks any atmosphere.Didn't have time for the spa and pool which clearly are features to be explored. Chose to stay here because the Carlyle was full but in my view the latter is the clear winner on all counts and this is a poor cousin in a distinguished lineage of hotels.	
Jul 1 2007 	Not what we expected	Given the price we paid to stay here for several nights we thought we were going to get a pretty decent hotel room and upon our arrival the hotel seemed fine. It had an okay lobby, but everything after that was downhill. The doorman and the front desk attendants were cold and quite unfriendly (an exception being the bellhops who were refreshingly pleasant and helpful). Also the front desk provided us with inaccurate information about the hotel which proved troublesome. The room itself was small, but that's to be expected; what we didnt except was the awful bathroom. The tub was stained and damaged like nothing I've ever seen, the bathroom was right next to one of the two very small double beds in our room, which by the way had sheets which were also stained and there were holes in the blankets. The room also felt unclean and icky. Several days later we stayed at a comfort inn which was a big relief from the ickiness of this room. Also there was another door in the room which connected to another hotel room and we could hear our neighbors conversations, at times it was so clear its seemed they were in the room with us, walls were beyond paper thin. NY city is expensive so it's hard to find something reasonably priced, but either we got the worst room in the hotel or we over paid. The local of this hotel is okay, subway close and the hotel is in Korea town which was interesting, good ice cream at a nearby store and several nearby Korean restaurants. Also you can walk around and find lots of food places. The only somewhat good thing about this hotel was the location of on 32nd street, not too far from points of interest, but for most places you still need to get on the subway. Don't go in expecting much at all. Okay for maybe 1 night, but I would not stay here again, there's way better out there.	
Jul 28 2005	Most Terrible Hotel in New York	Worst experience ever! New York trip was ruined due to unfriendly staff, horrible attitude towards the guests. I have had a decent experience with the Ramada Inn's in other locations but this was the worst hotel experience ever.	
Apr 30 2009 	Good value hotel	Made a search at Tripadvisor by ranking, selected this hotel based on location and recommendations. On a hotel web-site I found a good offer, so overall it has been the very good ratio between price and quality.As mentioned by others the location is perfect, it is easy to walk around / to travel by subway. Other comments:- MVP Bus leaves for DC in front of Penn Plaza, 7 mins walk, arriving same place. We checked-out, left luggage (for free, only tips) at the hotel before bus. Then in a few days we returned back, had a few hours before flight so I decided to go to the hotel and ask them storing the luggage again. It worked perfectly, only a few dollars was asked to be paid. Very convenient.- we stayed at the 17th floor, no really noise from outside, have to admit that you can hear all the time elevator and ventilation noise, not killing at all, but for very sensitive person ask a room at least next corner after elevator.- when we checked-in a receptionist didn't look very friendly, but when checked out and next visit storing luggage - other receptionists were OK- breakfast is simple, but fresh- wi-fi worked well on iPod- room was big enough, cleaned daily- announced free calls within the US (didn't try though)I would say it's good 3 stars hotel by European measures. Certainly recommendened to others.	
May 19 2008	Great Stay	We had 4 nights in NYC. Never having been there before just took a stab in the dark over the Internet. We were very pleasantly surprised by the hotel considering its low star rating. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Gave us toothbrushes and toothpaste when our luggage was 24 hours behind us. They directed us to a sister hotel across the road for free Internet use when our in room service didn't work. Great location - so close to everything. Breakfast was good but often very crowded. But didn't really go to NYC to waste too much time eating breakfast anyway.	
Oct 9 2006	Excelent Location with a reasonable price	I've stayed in Red Roof Inn for 8 nights, and the Hotel fulfilled all my expectations (which were high due to the tripadvisor reviews). The main strength is its location, right behind the empire state building. In terms of service, it is plain vanilla, being the only extra a decent breakfast (a rarity in New York standards). The room was big enough (probably for American standards could be considered small) and the bed was excellent. The main weakness is the slow elevators. In conclusion, for a budget and no-frills stay in NY this is an excellent value for money choice.	
Mar 15 2005	Our apprehension was totally unwarranted	This Red Roof Inn located at 6 W. 32nd Street was exactly what we wanted. We stayed in a room with two double beds, and the room was larger than most NYC hotels in this price range. The room was not fancy, but clean and comfortable. It was not old and dingy. The only objectionable part was there was a little grime around the doorknob on the bathroom door, but that was easily taken care of with a wet wipe! Upon check in, the desk attendant gladly offered us a room with a small (clean) refrigerator and microwave when we told her it was a special mother/daughters weekend celebrating a 40th birthday. It was early December, and the refrigerator came in handy for holiday treats, wine, cheeses, leftover food items, and milk for coffee. There were 4 women in the room, and we never felt terribly cramped, but we are all seasoned travelers, and very agreeable regarding sharing space and shower rotations. The continental breakfast consisted of several different breads for toast, English muffins, bagels and condiments, orange juice, coffee, milk, oatmeal, and fresh bananas and apples. We were glad we had taken our own healthy cereal for variety, and we used the milk from the breakfast room. You cannot beat the price or location for accomodations. The hotel staff was professional, and we felt like they would have fixed any problems, had we encountered any. We are eager to try one of the three sister hotels in this Apple Core chain on our next visit, but we might just stay here again, because we know it's a good deal.	
Oct 13 2009 	Hotel 57 Is My New Hotel Of Choice In Manhattan!	Recently, my Partner and I stayed at the newly renovated (and newly Renaissanced) Marriott Hotel 57, a gorgeous boutique hotel in the Midtown East a.k.a. Sutton Place district of Manhattan. After reading a few reviews warning against the hotel, we were a bit concerned, but decided as most of the concerns focused on stays during the renovation process that we could chance it as the renovations had been completed several weeks prior to the beginning of our stay. Were thrilled we took the chance as our five-night stay at the Hotel 57 was extremely pleasant, luxurious, and more than memorable. From the Lacava fixtures in the sumptuous bathroom (we stayed in one of the Sky Loft suites complete with a huge private terrace) right down to the Breville Die-Cast Smart Toaster (http://nifty.cjw1.me/N) featured in the concierge lounge on the main gallery level, this hotel has seen to every detail to make its guests feel pampered and special. The staff of the hotel expertly seemed genuinely friendly, was utterly attentive, and completely professional. Our suite was sumptuous albeit fairly compact, and it should be known this is completely in keeping the boutique hotel style  if youre used to your hotel rooms being the same size as your suburban McMansion bedroom, you wont understand or appreciate the boutique style and should perhaps stay elsewhere. As it stands, we live in a two-story loft in the metropolitan downtown of a world-class U.S. city, and are well-used to compact city life. The suite afforded us to amazing views of the surrounding buildings and starting / ending each day of our stay relaxing on the private terrace was nothing short of sublime. The bedding was, as expected of a hotel of this caliber, top quality and completely comfortable. The bathroom was quite luxurious and beautifully appointed, featuring double sinks and plenty of space; the fantastic steam-shower in particular was a welcome treat. The renovations of the hotel have more than paid off and the modern organic esthetic of the Hotel 57s new look oozes charm, sophistication, and whispers posh just loudly enough to be heard (as opposed to shouting it in a brash and flashy way); new photos taken during the hotels recent Marriott Renaissance Branding Party have replaced the artists concept drawings previously on the site and are well worth a look. We dined at the Opia restaurant, starting with appetizers and cocktails on the hotel-side in what serves as the concierge lounge by weekday, and were very impressed with the quality and deliciousness of the food we ordered  our stay in Manhattan focused on eating in some of the best restaurants the city has to offer, and we felt Opia easily kept pace with those places. I encourage you to seriously consider staying in the Hotel 57 and am confident you wont regret it.	
Sep 25 2009 	Excellent hotel in a great location	Arrived to the hotela at 5pm and unfortunately our rooms weren't ready. Not a good start but we were offered drinks and an appetiser while we waited. The rooms were not huge but spacious enough and very well appointed. The staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay and nothing was too much trouble including recommending and booking restaurants for us. We booked our rooms through Tavelzoo and got a great rate which made our stay all the more enjoyable and affordable.	
Sep 5 2009 	Not Great for Business Travel	This was not my favorite Marriott Hotel. On the plus side, It has a great mid-town location on the corner of Lexington and 57, walking distance from major tourist attractions. The zen bathroom with double-size stall shower was fabulous. The bed and the linens were quite nice, which is standard for the Marriott. Now for the negative. My visit to the restaurant was a disaster. The service was both arrogant and incompetent - a particularly horrible combination. When I complained to Marriott management, they distanced themselves, telling me that they just leased the space to the restaurant and that they have had other complaints. Due to my complaint the restaurant manager called me and offered me a coupon for another visit. I declined, because who wants to waste a meal in NYC at a substandard restaurant? She insisted, took my address, and several months later has yet to send me the coupon. Adding insult to injury, as they say. The concierge lounge takes the minimalist approach to food, with a small plate of sliced fruit, a few muffins here, tiny pitchers of milk. A lady helping herself to some of the fruit worried there wouldn't be enough for other guests.The decor may strike some as wacky. The hotel isn't consistent and doesn't have a decent restaurant, so it isn't great for business travel where you may arrive late and just want service. If you're staying here as a tourist it may be a better bet because of the proximity to the attractions and because you are less likely to use the restaurant or concierge lounge. For business travel I prefer the Marriott Eastside a few blocks away.	
Apr 9 2007	Everything it promised and more	Service was great, the view was amazing and the concierge was the best I have encountered. This hotel is everything it is cracked up to be. There could be no better way to experience the theatre district in all it's grandeur.	
Apr 15 2009	good stay and good time	my atay at the residence inn was wonderfull, great attentive staff with a clean room . I loved the fitness center and was impressed how prompt housekeeping was when i called the front desk for some trash bags and within minutes they were knocking on my door with them. To park your vehicle in their garrage was a little pricey, but that was my only gripe. Loved it and will go back.	
Feb 28 2008 	very pleasant experience	After extensive online research, I booked a King Suite at this hotel for a mother/daughter weekend with my teenager. Our trip was delayed by one day due to a Nor'easter here in New England and the staff at the hotel was kind enough to rebook us at the same great rate without penalty. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and &quot;upgraded&quot; to a corner room on the 27th floor with a nice view. The room was exactly as pictured in previous reviews - wonderful bed w/extra pillows, nice kitchenette and small but functional bath with an oversized dual showerhead and plenty of hot water. The third floor lounge was enormous and a peaceful place to grab a cup of coffee and complimentary newspapers (including NYTimes). Breakfast selection was good and as mentioned in an earlier review even better on Monday than over the weekend. Easy walk to Broadway, Macy's, Rockefeller center, etc. From the front desk to the housekeeping, the staff was very accommodating. We had no problems with the elevators but were there on a quiet weekend and up fairly early. I must add that the room was quieter than expected for NYC and was only awaken one night by an ambulance siren. I would highly recommend thishotel to both business travelers and small families and plan to make this my hotel of choice for future visits.	
Nov 20 2007 	classy retreat	we stayed with our toddler in a harbor view room at the ritz carlton last weekend and felt very well looked after. the welcome - a speedy check-in and chilled champagne for us and an adorable teddy bear for our son - set the tone. we had a standard room which was spacious, well-appointed and in a good state of upkeep - no cracks, chips or 80s furniture hangovers. the bathroom was spacious and so nice to see bulgari white tea toiletries - appropriate brand for an urban luxury hotel. housekeeping were fantastic - a crib was in the room when we arrived made up as requested, and when our son was sick late at night, they silently appeared without fuss, cleared up kiddy vomit from the carpet and crib, moved in a fresh crib and sheets, and left him in peace. we booked a really terrific babysitter upon a recommendation from the hotel - the service was not cheap at $27 per hour plus additions, but for peace of mind, well worth it. my only quibbles, and these were very irritating, were a) that the concierge CONSTANTLY put us on hold whenever we called for help - this is so rude - and b) the bellman who took our luggage down to the lobby hung around for a tip and told us that he probably would not be around when we returned to collect the luggage mid afternoon - yet when we returned at our appointed time, to our surprise there he was. it's disappointing to see service transgressions at such a terrific hotel.	
Feb 23 2005	Ritzy at the Ritz!	I stayed here with my daughter and son in law. We stayed 2 nights in October 2004. The rooms are pricey but one doesn't worry about gross creatures in the beds etc. :( The room was very nice. The view of the Harbor was very beautiful. We could see the Statue of Liberty very clearly. The subway is close-by and taxis are everywhere. The hotel staff are friendly and remember your name. WOW!! I thought only people like The Trumpster got that service. The Ritz is also close by lots of tourist spots,easily within walking distance. The bathrooms are the BEST!!! Workout area is also great. Choose this Hotel. You will be glad! :)	
Jun 17 2009 	The Old Worn Shoe Needs Repair	After reading all the reviews, I decided that this would be a good option for a one-night business trip with a leisure component at a reasonable price. Thought it would be like well-worn pajamas or weekend clothes -- comfortable and clean -- but it was anything but. Ever hear the expression that says &quot;You get what you pay for?&quot; Well, even at this price, it was overpriced.On a scale from 1 being &quot;forget it&quot; to 10 being &quot;loved it&quot;, this would be a three (3). And only a three (3) because of the one positive aspect of this hotel -- the staff. Front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. Bell captain was the best. Housekeeping was nice albeit did not respond to a request until after the second call. That's where the positives end.Here's the scoop -- mold surrounding the air conditioning unit ... the peep hole was surely a peep hole -- you could see everything from the hallway *into* the room ... peeling paint, chips and scratches on the walls... the telephone button to call the front desk did not work ... the TV was terrible -- everything was cloudy and people had a lovely &quot;greenish&quot; hue ... the bathroom plug would not *hold* a hairdryer or anything else ... the light switches were dirty (and this included the bathroom) ... the bathroom was beyond worn and the surfaces were anything but clean ... the curtains were worthless in terms of darkening the room as you could see everything when the lights went out ... and the lights throughout the room precluded reading or, in the bathroom, makeup application.A few people stated that it was fine for one night. While hardly one who expected a five-star hotel, I would never stay again even for one night as there are other hotels in the same vicinity where -- for a few more dollars -- one could find a much cleaner and comfortable hotel.	
Feb 22 2006	Trendy But Friendly Hotel	Loved my stay at the Roger Williams Hotel. Convenient to Midtown as well as Chelsea &amp; the Village and close to subway. Rooms are a bit small but well designed with colorful furnishings and incredibly comfortable beds (so soft and cozy).Great view of Empire State building (watch the lights go out at midnight!). Elevators small but no waiting time experienced during weekend stay. Paid a great interenet rate (saturday full price with sunday free!) and was treated wonderfully by the friendly staff. No problem with request for two double beds, room with a view, and allowed early check-in. Be aware of the daily surcharge per person.	
Sep 13 2009 	Very nice hotel close to subway stations lovely breakfast	We stayed in Room Mate Grace for 10 nights. We liked it very much, especially breakfast was great. It's close to Times Square, which is just a bit too busy, but there are two subway stations nearby. There is a swimming pool!The only downside I can think of is the poor WiFi reception in our room.Definetly great value for money!	
Oct 9 2008 	Best beds	Perfect beds, probably the best in NYC.Poor service.Excellent breakfast (included in price!).Ambivalent location (Times Square...).	
Apr 22 2008 	Hotel QT	We stayed at the Hotel QT whilst in NYC to get married (we eloped!). The first thing that strikes you is the very central location - a block away from Times Square. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful through out our stay, and we were given a complimentary bottle of champagne on our wedding day, which was a nice touch.We were first given a room on the 6th floor which was very oddly shaped and you walked through the door virtually into the bathroom. I returned to the reception/kiosk and asked for a second room. We were given a room on the 10th floor which was fine, except for the noise of construction work dircetly outside (stated at 6.30am!). We probably would have put up with this, but not for our wedding trip. I went to reception and was immediately upgraded to a suite on 15th floor. The suite was fantastic - one wall was entirely glass and you could see parts of Times Square through the buildings, it had a double shower and a huge bed on a platform. We would definately return to Hotel QT.	
May 23 2007 	Can't wait to go back!	This hotel was a tue gem! What a find!! I had one of the smallest rooms listed on the website but it was plenty big for one and would have been just fine for 2 people. The underbed storage area made it the room feel bigger than it was. The bathroom was well-appointed and I appreciated having a shower rather than a tub--it felt much roomier, I always feel very claustrophobic in hotel tubs. The neutrogena shampoo/conditioner/shower gel were definitely welcome. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE at the QT was extremely friendly, from the front-desk (very accommodating when my room wasn't ready for check-in--I was early--in taking my bags, helping me find my way around the City, etc) to the cleaning lady who had a smile on her face all the time. The complimentary breakfast was more than adequate and consisted of coffee/fresh juice, bagels, croissants, fruit, yogurt, muffins, and hard-boiled eggs. The pool was a nice addition too at the end of a long day before heading back out to the theatre at night. And there were no creepy men, as someone previously mentioned. It does get a little busy at night in the bar area but it was never a problem and there was always security present. As a female traveling alone, the location was ideal in the heart of the theatre district, I never felt unsafe walking to the hotel. Overall, this was the best hotel experience and I can't wait to go back to the QT!!!!	
Jun 25 2008 	Exceeded expectations	The hotel has such a hip, cool vibe, particularly for being so centrally located. We were graciously upgraded from our superior room to a suite. The suites are amazing. We had our own hallway and the room was huge by NY standards, even for a suite. The special round bathtub is a nice treat after walking the city all day long. The service was very prompt and courteous, the concierge was helpful, and the location was perfect. We were not disappointed and would go back.	
Jan 14 2008 	Super cool - but impractical		
Sep 14 2009 	Everything you want - except exciting design	Much better than expected!It was one of the more economical options in Midtown at the time of booking, and since the rooms were said to be very big (and they are), I was expecting a catch.Looking at the pictures on tripadvisor, I thought the catch would be that the rooms were in fact old, outdated, smelly, noisy. Well, they're not! Newly refurnished, but in a very oldfashioned bland design.So, good location, very big, well equipped rooms.On first day we went to the $4 breakfast at 7am. Was okay. Next days we went there later (8ish) and then it was way too busy. Not worth the wait (not that good) so went to countless breakfast alternatives in the area.Would go back although usually I tend to go for bit more exciting design.	
Jul 25 2009 	no complaints	Stayed at hotel mid July 2009 for 2 nights. Had booked hotel after reading rave reviews on Trip Advisor. Wasn't disappointed. Hotel room old but very clean. The lifts groaned and went slowly and the hotel corridors need some new decor but no other complaints. Staff pleasant enough...had approached them about getting a taxi to Bayonne (to join a cruise ship) and asked if we would have any problems stopping a cab in the street . They offered to book a car ($70) ....it turned out to be a white stretch limousine.! It made our holiday! Breakfast is good....cereal, donoughts, fruit, croissants muffins, bagels, bread, juices, coffee. Kept being topped up. Get there early. We waited 10 minutes but when we left there was a queue of 30 people. Great breakfast for kids as they can eat as much as they want. Location excellant and local pizza restaurant delivers to your room...ideal after a delayed flight from Heathrow.( and it was good pizza). There was a small safe in room which was ideal for storing jewellery, cameras etc. Good value for money	
Mar 31 2008 	Great value location !!	Just spent four days at the Salisbury on W57th Street in New York.Had two three person suites on 7th floor.Very spacious,firm but comfortable beds,good maid service;decor and bathrooms looking a bit tired now but clean and functional.Kitchenette great for tea and coffee making.Hotel is located very close to Carnegie Hall,Central Park and the main line shopping on 5th Avenue.Time Square is a 15 minute walk.Excellent pizza's two doors down at Angelo's and definitely try the burger joint in the Parker Meridien Hotel directly opposite the Salisbury.Expect to queue but worth the wait.Also try the breakfast at the Carnegie Deli but only if your hungry as the portions are big.If you are booking the Salisbury try and book a room at the back of the building which will be quieter.We were on the 7th floor and the noise off 57th Street all night did disrupt the sleep of a couple of our party.Staff at the Salisbury were very friendly and helpful.Long queues for the Statue of Liberty ferry due to the security screening of bags pre boarding so go early or pre book.Natural History Museum definitely worth a visit and if you go shopping at Macey's call in to the customer visitor centre with some photo ID and collect a discount card worth 11% off most purchases.	
Jun 23 2009 	Perfect Stay At The San Carlos	Our best friends suggested San Carlos and they were right! Everything was perfect starting with my telephone reservation. Desk team was fantastic throughout , helpful and service with a smile. We were initially greeted by Gabriel who said &quot;we've been expecting you&quot; and showed our 10 yr. old son a clever little magic trick which made us feel welcome. Cleanest hotel room I've ever seen-the housekeeper even moved a small table into the bathroom when she noticed we needed more counter space. Doormen and Bellmen were great. Very pleasant and even arranged parking for a family member who came to visit. Continental breakfast was convenient, more than enough and selections were presented well. Business Center is a bonus. Outstanding location. Our experience was superior and the San Carlos will be our hotel of choice for future trips to NYC!!	
Mar 21 2007 	Outstanding staff	What a friendly, helpful staff we met at this boutique hotel. Starting with the bellman and continuing to the front desk staff, we were so impressed with their friendliness. Even the housekeeper we met in the elevator was charming. Mint, the restaurant next door is terrific (Indian cuisine). The room was nicely appointed and very clean, however, it was a bit small and the window was located high in the wall, so you couldn't see outside. Also, I would request a room in back next time since I found the sirens and honking horns of NYC a bit much. But overall, it seems a good location and we appreciated the accommodating staff.	
Jun 27 2006	clean spacious quiet friendly hotel in a prime NYC location	After reading many reviews of many NYC hotels, we chose the San Carlos for a 5 night stay in NY--and we're so glad we did. For us (two women in our late 40s) it was PERFECT: the room was quiet, comfortable, large, and spotlessly clean; we had high-speed internet access from the room (WiFi from the Business lounge on the 2nd floor). We appreciated, as well, the small fridge and countertop. All the staff (from the desk to the front door to the housekeepers) were friendly and professional but not intrusive. When we return to NY, we'll definitely check out the San Carlos first. As other reviews have noted, there's a decent grocery store on 2nd, and numerous restaurants within walking distance. We were most satisfied with the restaurants in the more residential areas (to the N, E, and NE) of the hotel. Thanks to all the previous reviewers who tipped us off to the San Carlos--I don't know that we would have found it w/o TripAdvisor! A great place!	
Jun 30 2008 	Buena eleccion		
Jun 2 2009 	Fantastic Location good all round hotel.	I have stayed in the Belvedere, The Milford Plaza, The Travel Inn,Novotel and Vincci Avalon and I would rate the New York Sheraton as one of the best. The rooms at the Avalon were bigger and the decor was better but the location of the Sheraton was spot on. Easy to access everywhere and very easy to find. Very simple check in service, no long queues and the staff were pleasant and helpful. Rooms were on the small side but that is not unusual for new york, bathroom was also small.Only negative point I would have is that the bag checking service is expensive, $3 for each individual item, case, coat, carrier bag etc. This proved to be very expensive for us as we were a party of 7.We did not eat in the hotel as the breakfast was $27.50, too expensive for us.My sons used the gym. $10 for one session or $20 for our stay. They were very impressed with the facilities.I would definately stay at the sheraton again.	
Nov 25 2008 	Avoid this hotel	Arrived at the hotel to be told we had to pay a hundred dollar deposit for the room despite not being told this in advance. Next we go up to our room which was clean however a little shabby with ink stains on the carpet, door handle hanging off the bathroom and scuffed skirting boards. After a half an hour wait for the bell captain we received our luggage, as we started to unpack all of a sudden our door burst open and a man walked in quickly apologising and leaving, we are not sure how he got in. Leaving the hotel we have to catch a cab to the main attractions (times square) as its just simply too far to walk its around a half hour walk and with the new york hustle and bustle its especially difficult when returning with shopping bags. That even we go to bed and it is simply sweltering in the room far too hot we try to open the window but as we are located near a rail way line an building sight its just too noisy. Over the next few days we grew less satisified especially on the last night when we where woken at 3AM by next door having loud sex we complain to the security only to find him listening in outside their door only knocking when he sees us come out of our room! To round of this nighmare stay we check out only to be told we have to pay a dollar for each of the phone calls we apprently made 45 phone calls! we whereonly there five days! Also we had bought a phone card to use on the phone from their hotel shop where no one told us about the charge! All in all I would choose somewhere else to stay espeically if its a family holiday or shopping holiday you are looking for	
Jul 28 2004	You get what you pay for! AKA "Rat Hotel"	I would not write a bad review unless I felt it was absolutely necessary. So to avoid others from making the same mistake as I did I definitely wanted to publish something for everyone to read. Upon checking in, the room's tub had spaghetti in the bath tub, however that was not the reason we had to abruptly leave. While in our room, we saw a &quot;rat&quot; run by the curtain. Upon calling the front desk, they sent a man with a flashlight who informed us this was the 4th time however the rat(s) usually hide by the time they get there. The front desk did not do anything to accomodate us. Their answer was the Mgr. was gone till Monday they were overbooked by 6 rooms and had no vacancies. Whereas my reply was so you are expecting us to sleep with the &quot;rats&quot;. Needless to say, I and my 78 yr. old mother checked out immediately. Staff was very unprofessional at all times. Rooms accomodations were not met as originally requested and even though you have a reservation you are not guaranteed a room (six were without rooms at 10pm in a city awaiting the DNC)! However, I think their add should include &quot;Hotel Pets aka rats as a hotel ammenity!	
Jan 24 2004	Don't walk...RUN from this hotel!	I booked a night at Skyline to take my boyfriend out for a romantic evening, and it was terrible! The room we had was tiny...and cold! There was a sad excuse for a blanket and the heat sounded like a team of construction workers! We had to choose between warm and loud or cold and quiet!We woke up at 2 am because we were so uncomfortable and ordered food from a nearby diner that delivered to the hotel. My boyfriend had to go downstsairs to pick up the food because they wouldn't let the delivery man come up!There were 3 lamps in the room - 2 of which did not work. The towels were small and paper thin.When we (finally) checked out, we went to get our car from the $8 garage, where we were allowed to keep our car until 3 pm without getting charged. We got to the window at 3:04 and were not helped until 3:14...at which point the manager charged us for the entire next HOUR because we were a few minuted late and then had to wait on their line!To make a long story short, this was a terrible hotel and turned a romantic night into a nightmare...I know New York City can be pricey, but pay extra...its worth it!Good Luck!	
Oct 7 2002	Godd hotel in a great location		
Feb 16 2009 	Very nice room good service and central location	I stayed here with my wife for 5 days while in NYC for a wedding on the back end of a 25 day trip in the US. We were sitting on the fence for a long time before deciding to book here rather than the Palace which we had heard was great. We know New York and wanted to stay in this area only (Mid Town but nearer 5th than Times Square). However, we are Sofitel fans and have stayed a few times in one of our favouite spots - The Sofitel St James, London - so we expected a certain standard which we got. It's not cheap, but for the hotel standard and location, it's not over priced either. It's right around the corner from St Patrick's Cathedral and a host of other &quot;areas of interest&quot; are within walking distance. The room was perfect - large by NYC standards - Clean and modern with a decent size bathroom and a very comfortable bed. We dined out in some of the well-known eateries in the area during our stay and returned one evening to the very nice hotel bar (The only part of the service which was not up to scratch with a surly barwoman who seemed annoyed to have to make a couple of mojitos - but that would not put either of us off - everyone can have an off day!). We booked through the Sofitel Website and got a special offer which there was some confusion over at check-out (but when I presented the website print-out which detailed the &quot;total amount due&quot;, the staff promply amended the bill downward by about $400 and apologised, giving the explanation that the web-site was incorrect). The response was excellent but I was disapointed with the error as I really feel uncomfortable complaining or disputing a bill - so whatever the issue is, I hope they correct it. These little issues were inconsequential and can be a part of any hotel experience - overall, I would definitely recommend it.	
Nov 1 2008 	showering in bottled water..	That's right. I washed up with bottled water when I stayed at the Soho Grand...Granted, I may have some ridiculous standards when it comes to my hotel rooms (including functioning plumbing and a prompt and responsive staff). However, the Soho Grand certainly failed in providing these. During my stay on October 30, 2008, I woke up to get ready for an important client meeting when I discovered that the water coming out of the sink faucet was a murky brown color. Next, I tried the shower, only to find that the water there was also brownish in color.I promptly called the front desk, and they said that that someone would be up immediately to address the problem. After nearly 10 minutes and no response, I called back, and the staff again reassured me that someone would be up to address the situation. Again, after several minutes, I called the front desk asking to be transferred to another room so that I could shower. Now, the staff told me that this was neighborhood problem and nothing could be done to correct the problem. The staff then connected me to room service, who after explaining the situation, sent up four glass bottles of ice cold Saratoga water.I truly am grateful for the opportunity to shower with bottled water; however, the hotel staff clearly lacks an understand of how best to address such problems. First, if it is a neighborhood problem (and thus out of the hotel's control), please tell me that it is rather than telling me to waste my time waiting for maintenance. Second, if you are going to provide me with water to wash up, it may be better to send something that didn't come directly from the Arctics to my room.Overall, a very disappointing (and retrospectively hilarious) experience.	
May 12 2008	TINY room cute wallpaper	Oh NY hotels. The big chains are just so average and the boutique hotels are sometimes just...so average. The hotel is in a great location if you want to be in Soho and near tribeca. the rooms here are really tiny, i thought i was going to have to sleep with my suitcase. in general, the room seemed pretty clean - although i ended up with a bug bite after one night, and my friend who stayed with my on the second night came away with a bug bite.... The bathroom amenities were so-so - bigelow products. if you are looking for a chichi little spot with a lounge that oozes hipness and staff that are mediocre, this place fits the bill.	
May 20 2007	Overpriced little value	Have stayed at a variety of hotels, all well under the 600.00 USD per night I payed at the Soho Grand, and had a much better experience. The hotel overall looked dirty, and needs some money injected into it. The fact that smoking is allowed at all I was quite surprised at in this day and age. I was most shocked at however the small amenities missing such as no coffee machines in the room (the fact that I saw a guest in her pajamas having to leave her room to go down the hall for a coffee from a coffee machine), no ironing boards, and no morning paper. When I checked out no one asked how my stay was, even after I asked for a comment card...I now know why!	
May 26 2006 	bad for a 5-star hotel	I had issue with my card keys every day and had to go down on a slow elevator to the reception all the time. Sometimes the hotel staff happened to be there and they helped me. (they were actually nice) But the reception was usually shorthanded and I had to wait for a while...it made me feel miserable at the end of the day, when i was looking for a relaxed bath!The room was not throughly cleaned, and in fact I found more than one grass particles on the floor, fortunately before I inujured myself. Amenities were not replenished until I leave a note to ask for.. (I tipped! fyi)Coffee maker is not in the room, while there was a big coffee machine outside along with ice maker. Many people went there in their bathrobe.. so did I..even though I once was taught not to go out of the room in such an attire :p Afterall it was a five-star hotel, so you can expect comfort to certain extent, but I thought I could expect more! (my rating is based on my expectation for the hotel of that grade, just let you know.)	
Jan 3 2006	New year's eve at the soho grand	the hotel was as nice as boutique hotels get in manhattan. the turn down service is markedly thoughtful, and the level of hospitality is a level above the majority of hotels.that being said, there were two issues with the hotel:1. i requested a goldfish and a bose sounddock three days before I checked in. It took 3 phone calls and 2.5 hours for me to get it.2. room service food was below average, not something that i would expect from a 1st tier boutique hotel. but despite those two annoyances, the hotel is stunning, and i would gladly go back.	
Jul 19 2004	OK .. could be great	The hotel is very nice .... rooms 650 square foot and nicely furnished. Roof terrace pool is a NY revelation.They just need to start again on the staff front. As it is a members club, they are funny on the door towards hotel guests (at $700 per night !!). After 5 nights, the reception staff still hadnt recognised my wife and I and would challenge us with &quot;What do you want ?&quot; each time we entered the hotel.If they can train their staff properly, it will be a fantastic place to stay	
Aug 24 2008 	Adored the Alex Hotel in Manhattan	I just want everyone to know how much we enjoyed staying at The Alex Hotel in Manhattan. The room was perfectly appointed and the staff was delightful. From the front desk receptionist to the valet it was a perfect experience. It is the first time that I stayed in New York and actually loved it! The suite is not a tiny box and contains everything one could possibly need. We loved the location too! It was really easy to get to everything.The Riingo restaurant in the hotel was also outstanding!Please know that this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review!Enjoy!Roni and Lenny Cohn	
Sep 21 2009	Good central hotel	The Belvedere is a good quality hotel a couple of blocks from Times Square. I travelled with my father and we shared a room with two double beds. It was clean and the furniture and fittings looked reasonably new. The bathroom was good with a hot shower. There were coffee making facilities in the room. The room was quiet. We had no problem with the lifts unlike some of the reports below. We didn't eat in the hotel as there were plenty of placed nearby. I'd recommned it as a based in Midtown Manhattan that costs less than some of the big chains but still offers excellent quality.	
Jun 23 2009 	Good Location Poor Service	The hotel has an excellent location. It is within easy walking distance to Time Square and Central Park South. Metro to Brooklyn and the Financial District are also nearby. Refrigerator, microwave and sink is added value if traveling with small children. The rooms are small, but it is NY. Room service is normal. What made the stay so disappointing was the lobby service. The concierge was a total rip off. Don't book any tickets there. The information provided is misleading. Also, be prepared to throw huge tips out at the doorman as well as for any luggage service. I wouldn't stay there again, and try e.g. the Best Western on 48th Street between 7th and 8th.	
Jul 28 2008 	Makes you want to stay out longer!	The initial reaction to entering the standard king bed room is this place is old and small. The bathroom takes small to new levels. You can wash your hands while sitting on the toilet. We also had the same problem someone else mentioned about the hair dryer blowing a fuse. But they did have a second hair dryer placed in the closet and that one seemed to do okay. The front desk staff was pleasant, but wouldn't let us check in until 4:00 pm even though I'm sure when we arrived at 3:00 pm rooms were available. The concierge always has a line.The elevators are painfully slow and rather small. What is really frustraing is waiting forever and seeing a full elevator open, having to wait for the next. There is only one ice machine and one soda machine, each located on the second floor.The location is good. But you can do better for your money. Skip the Belvedere.	
Jun 9 2008 	Perfect Stay	The Belvedere was perfect for a weekend visit! Room was as described, friendly staff, gym was adequate and of course location is amazing. Will definitely be back!	
Dec 29 2007 	Great	I was on my own so wanted to be fairly central and this hotel ticket all the boxes for me. The room was lovely not small at all and I asked for a high floor with a view and that is what I got! I didnt eat in the hotel as was out and about each morning. I found the tour desk helpful re recommending places to eat etc etc Went to galagers steak house only about 10 monute walk away ended up going twice and I was onlt there 4 nights!!! All in all a lovely hotel one which I have recommened to a few people who are going next year and I for one will book there again.	
Aug 24 2009 	the best around	i arrived at the hotel and was greeted from the moment i got to the door. all of the staff was friendly and welcoming. the rooms were spacious and very clean. from start to finish it was a fantastic experience.	
Oct 2 2008 	My FAVORITE place to stay in NYC!	We stayed here for our 10th aniversary and it rained the entire long weekend, so we spent more time than usual in our room drying off and warming up!We were upgraded from the already wonderful studio suite to a king 1 bedroom and it was heaven! From the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in to the quiet night's rest, sleep was peaceful and ultra-comfortable. We ordered delivery chinese one night and stayed in and it was FANTASTIC, fast and delicious. The shower was hot and had great pressure. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked. We never saw the maids, but the room was cleaned each day and the towels stocked. The front desk was fast for check-in and check-out and the staff was helpful and polite. Very professional and friendly staff all around.Based on our experience, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city. Location central to Metro, bus lines, and cabs are everywhere! Easy walking distance to great food, sites and attractions.	
Aug 27 2008 	slipping Benjamin	the Benjamin is not what it used to be. This was my eighth stay over a period of 5+years and this time I felt not having enough for my money.The suite was a high floor corner with a very small bathroom. The sofa/bed was torn so they put 2 (why 2?)cots in so the living room was so crowded that I did not once use it. It precluded me from having guests come up.The air conditionning individual units were very noisy. Even on the 17th floor ,the lack of proper window isolation made the room quite noisy.The elevator were not functionning efficiently and the bellmen were continously not using the service elevator to transport luggage. The front desk people were not very welcoming nor attentive. Next time I will go somewhere else until they renovate further this is not 4*	
Sep 13 2007 	Fabulous stay will be back	I loved every minute of my stay at The Benjamin. It was my first time in NYC and i spent many hours researching the best place to stay in Midtown. I was so pleased with my decision. The staff was excellent...helpful and friendly. The room was very comfortable. I had a suite which was expensive but worth it. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom while not large was very efficient. It was great to have a huge closet and many deep drawers to store all the clothes etc i brought. Having that Kitchenette was great too...full size refrig with ice maker. The room was very quiet..heard a siren a few times but never bothersome. The bathrobes are outstanding, purchased one as soon as i got home thru website. The doormen were very helpful with suggestions and service. The lobby was perfect, never had to wait to talk to someone and get assistance. The elevators were just fine...stayed on 18th floor and always able to get the elevator within seconds. the bar is very cozy and enjoyable...good female bartender too. didn't have a chance to eat any food from the restaurant.i agree with a previous post that mentioned the &quot;no top sheet thing&quot;. Since i was aware of that i just called down to housekeeping and requested one...no problem. And any other request that i made was fulfilled with a pleasant attitude. If you want to stay in a perfect, safe location with friendly service and very comfortable, CLEAN rooms stay at the Benjamin. You won't be disappointed!	
May 9 2008 	This is "my flat in New York"	My husband and I always wanted an apartment in New York and have decided that THIS IS IT! The suites are huge, love the kitchenette, the bed is so very comfy, the shower is PERFECT. Great attentive service from housekeeping, bell staff and front desk.Yes the coffee maker is a joke. (I wish the bedspread were not kept on the bed, my personal preference.)We stayed here the first time for the location, but fell in love with the whole package. We just keep coming back, getting to know the little quirks of the neighborhood. So close to MoMA, Central Park, Bergdorf Goodman's, Rizzoli (the best bookstore in the world). It's not quite perfect, but nearly so. Let's keep it a secret or we won't be able to book it when we need it.The breakfast is pricey, but there are lots of fun, clattery diners close by filled with locals and other travellers where you can get a big dose of coffee, eggs and a earful of New York. We have not tried the restaurant for dinner. It always looks a little forlorn and we like to dine where there is a crowd.Do go to Fluffy Bakery around the corner on 7th Avenue toward 54thSt for sweet snacks. If you stay a few days, take flowers from the Florist next door to your room. We'll be happy to share our flat in New York with you!	
Dec 18 2006 	Excellent!	I stayed for two nights 12/15-12/17. The hotel location is near perfect as stated before given its close proximity to Central Park, shopping on 5th Ave, the Theater District, Times Square, etc. I did not have any issues with noise though I did call a few days beforehand to request a high floor. I was thus very satisifed with the 14th floor. Some people mentioned a long wait for the elevators in the morning but I never experienced issues coming from near the top of the hotel. Rooms were very nice and I did not quite understand previous complaints. The bathroom was exceptionally clean. I will acknowledge that the TV was on the small side, but if you are staying over in the city, you are likely not watching much TV in your room. In summary - I found the hotel to be a great value around the holidays. I booked early in k the year and likely saved significantly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Oct 4 2004	Can't say enough good things about this place		
Mar 18 2009 	great hotel	this is a nice hotel, and the stuff is very helpful.	
Aug 6 2008 	Pretentious Unacceptable customer service at The Bowery	My husband and I spent three days at The Bowery Hotel in NYC. Upon arrival and over the course of our stay, we were treated - at best - in a relatively cold, dismissive fashion. We, very consistently, felt as though extremely inappropriate and highly preferential treatment was given to the more high-profile guests of the hotel whilst we, as guests, were treated as though we were insignificant, inferior, and highly unimportant. We spent approximately $400 + tax per night for our room, and close to $500 at the on-site restaurant over the course of our three-day stay. We found this to be an extremely expensive bill for what ended up being an offensive and thoroughly disappointing experience. There are certainly a number of beautiful boutique hotels in NYC whose staff know how to take care of ALL their guests - go to these and give The Bowery a miss. Definitely not a recommended destination.	
Nov 5 2008 	Loved The Bryant Park Hotel	I am lucky enough to have travelled all over the world on business enjoying the best in service from the most exotic locales. I was thrilled to find this gem of a hotel right in my backyard of Manhattan, centrally located in midtown. I stayed there for a celebratory weekend with my boyfriend and the service was impeccable from the moment I arrived. The staff is ready and willing to help you with any need or concern. The room  a junior suite  was huge by Manhattan's standards and had great views. Plus Koi, an amazing Japanese restaurant, is right downstairs. (Get the Crispy Rice!!!) I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Jan 11 2009 	Nice Location	Classy hotel with a nice location. Compared to the other hotels in the area, this is a better choice for the money, walking distance to many attractions in NYC	
Dec 29 2007 	Overpriced room small by any std.non-functional HVAC 	I've stayed at quite a few NYC hotels and stayed at the Carlton only because there was a group function there. I had no pre-conceived opinions about the hotel. Indeed, I had no opinion.The staff was quite friendly.The lobby was rather immpressive. So far so good. And then there was the room ..... small even by New York CIty standards. Now the rooms at the W are small, but they're functional. Not so at the Carlton. The lighting was horrible. I discovered that two lamps had no bulbs, and after they were replaced, the lighting improved to &quot;very poor&quot;. It was nearly impossible to read on your bed at night.The telephone wouldn't reach the work desk. The was either no fan in the bathroom or a fan that wouldn't work, so you were in a steam zone after a shower. My wife couldn't get ready in the bathroom after a shower, and there was nowhere outside the bathroom for her to do her hair, makeup etc. I inquired about a larger room and was told ours was a larger room. (I made it clear I was not looking for a free upgrade. I just wanted a larger room)One concierge was quite helpful. The other was nice, but better suited for a Ramada in Omaha than a &quot;happening&quot; hotel in New York.Things really got ugly after bedtime. It was cold outside, and the thermostat essentially had no effect on the heat. When the heat was &quot;on&quot;, it blasted the temp up to 80 plus degrees, and there was no way to moderate the heat. If you turned the heat off, the room was quite cold. The best alternative was to leave a window open and the heat on, and that technique helped provide a tolerable environment.... until the traffic picked up in the morning and the noise woke you up.I asked to speak with a manager and was told one would call. No call was forthcoming.I have never posted a bad hotel review before, but this place was profoundly disappointing and over-priced. If you want to see it done the right way, check out the Bowery Hotel.	
Jun 2 2007	Wanna be part of it! NY NY.	Experienced New York's wettest day since 1882! And it was unusually cold for April said the locals. However, it was everything i thought it would be. Loved it. The hotel was a rather good choice I thought, expect for the damn blocking loo! At least they docked a hundred dollars for the inconvenience (literally!! - hehehe). Don't book room number 60! That apart it was very comfortable and quiet considering where it is. I think the reception staff could do with a little more zest towards their customers but it was fine and would stay there again as it is so convenient. BIG TIP - go to the Empire State Building between 8am and 8.45am to avoid the queues. Try the local greasy spoon diner to the right of the Hotel on Madison (Coffee something or other it was called). And for a Pizza Extravaganza the famous Lombardis on Spring Street will take some beating.Enjoy anyway, it's a totally fab city with a surprise around every corner.	
Apr 24 2007 	Comfort at a good price	A friend from texas and I stayed here in March 007. having previously stayed at the Essex house (a 5* on central park) I thought this was great. The room was bigger and more luxurious than the essex. We had a double deluxe. the rate online was good. 4 nights was just under $1100.one of the concierge staff was very helpful, another not quite as good. The door guys were very friendly. This hotel is really habdy for empire state macys etc. Its is also less than a block away from the subway and the 4 runs up and down the legth of lexington with is great for hopping on for Museum mile. Also really convenient for geting to grand central if you do not fancy the 20 minute walk.I think you'd be had pushed to find comfort at such value.I would definately re book	
Aug 28 2009 	Needs some facelift	I stayed at this hotel early 2009 with a close family friend. She is an old lady and in her mind Hemsley's Park Lane is still the best hotel. This exactly how you would describe this hotel - old glory. Pro:&quot;LOCATION&quot; - can't stress enough. The hotel is located steps from Columbus circle, 5th Ave., Central Park. This alone CAN compensate all the negative impressions. Service: Staff was kind, very professional and efficient. I especially enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant, and everyone was friendly. The food was great, too. Yes, this is not the &quot;hippest&quot; restaurant you can find nearby, but the restaurant itself, with old-world style glamorous decor overlooking the central park with classical music playing was in itself quite an experience. Con:Dated facility and its decor - The old-style decor must have been applied a long time ago so that it shows its age. Antique is antique, but the bathroom drawers and sealant surrounding the bath tubs can and should be replaced. The dark colored silk bedspread was not crisp probably due to age (I don't want to think it is due to cleanliness). The carpet also showed age, as you would tell that it has been trodden. However, I do hot have too much complaints, as it was well-kept and clean: Overall, my stay was pleasant. Maybe I am not into continental style decor, therefore I was not able to appreciate this hotel. Given my taste, this hotel still needs some updates in order to keep up with its past glory. (Or was there one ever?)	
Aug 31 2007 	Great Experience!	We used Hotels.Com for the first time, and I was a bit apprehensive about how we would be received; have read/heard that many hotels treat consolidators as second class citizens. Didn't need to worry! From our very gracious greeting at our early check-in (and arriving around 11 a.m. after flying all night), we received nothing but first-class, ***** star service. We asked for a renovated non-smoking room when we checked in. One wasn't available at that time (one in smoking was) so we accepted the non-renovated room. (They did tell us a renovated room would possibly be available a little later in the day.) Lovely room, large, good city view -- but very poor air conditioning. We went out for lunch, and when we got back, it was apparent the room hadn't gotten any cooler. My husband went down to the desk and came back with new key card to a non-smoking renovated room on another floor -- GREAT air conditioning, lovely room -- even bigger -- with a partial view of Central Park! Enjoyed our 5 night stay SO much! Tried room-service once; expensive (as are most meals we found in NYC!) but excellent food, presentation and service. The hotel is right next-door to a major subway line, which made commuting to the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows very easy! All in all, we loved the Helmsley Park Lane and hope to make this an annual tradition!	
Sep 11 2003	Great location great hotel		
Sep 11 2009 	Friendly Staff and Great Price	I stayed at this hotel in July with a couple of friends based on a recommendation that I received. From what my friend told me, I expected great service, free coffee and a nice room: my expectations were met. Definitely will be staying here again.	
Oct 31 2008 	Great Location Great Price	I stayed here with my mum and a couple of friends and despite the inital confusion over the outstanding balance the hotel was GREAT especially for the price you pay! The hotel is in an ideal location - walking distance to Macy's, Empre State and Times Square and close to the subway. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean and the hotel have tea, cofee and internet facilitiesWould definately go back and I do recommend.	
Feb 26 2007 	Perfect	One of the bests, if not the best, hotel to stay in manhattan. Amazing value, great location (2 blocks from Empire State Building, between 5th ave and broadway). The hotel staff is friendly and work out your problems promptly. Everything is clean, spotless! I couldn´t find a better deal.	
Jul 5 2006	Our favourite hotel in New York	My husband and I LOVE this hotel. Spotless, comfortable, very helpful staff and wonderfully central. We have stayed here every year for the past four years and cannot see the logic of forking out $300+ for a similar room in &quot;boutique&quot; or &quot;chain&quot; hotel. It may not have a sumptous bar where you can spend upwards of $20 on a cocktail but the money you will save here will more than make up for it during your NY stay.	
Feb 2 2006	good location	location is the best thing here. The hotel is perfectly adequate for a few days and was quite busy with a varied crowd from business types to students. Clean enough place and would stay here again.	
Nov 16 2009 	Perfecto		
Oct 24 2009 	Great hotel and location	I would definitely stay at the Hotel at Times Square again. I loved the location. It was a very nice room for the price. The room was nicely decorated and was very clean. You can't beat the price. The bed was very comfortable.	
Jun 23 2009 	Great value great location lots of info. in review.	Overall, for the money, this was a great value in Manhattan. We booked it directly though applecore.com and checked back frequently and got a lower rate by rebooking. We paid $130 a night. They had the best rate available from various websites. And it included a free continental breakfast and free wireless internet and computers/printer in the lobby.I will start with my problem issues:1. Biggest complaint - elevator service. They have 2 elevators, but at almost every time we used them, one was out of service for some unknown reason. It varied and wasn't always the same one, so it clearly wasn't an &quot;out of order&quot; issue. Frequently had long waits for the elevator.2. Bathroom window didn't lock, and it was accessible from the fire escape. 3. Breakfast lines were long and seating not available when we went each day.4. Maid service questionable. They did not restock our coffee or cups on any day. We had to repeatedly call each day for coffee packets.5. Trouble making calls to front desks - phones not working or busy, not sure.6. We found a pair of flip flops in our room one day, presumably left by room service. We actually didn't figure this out until we were leaving, as I and my niece both thought they belonged to the other person. Didn't have time to complain at checkout, but it is bothersome in retrospect to have someone in our room and leaving things. Looked like a man's flip flops.7. 2 computers in lobby always in use, though didn't have to wait long to use.8. Beds were double beds, not queen beds, as I thought the website said.Now, the good things.1. Great value for price.2. Great tourist location - a couple blocks from Times Square and the Theatre district. Close to Rockefeller Center. Close to 5th Avenue shopping. Can walk to Empire State Bldg (about 1 mile) and south side of Central Park (about 1 mile). 3. Nice room decor, large rooms, clean. Recently remodeled.4. Free wireless internet. 2 computers and printers in the lobby for printing out online tickets, etc. They could use more computers, as they were always in use though people seemed to get off quickly if you stood there and waited.5. Breakfast had good variety for continental breakfast - O.J., apple juice, milk, several cold cereals, oatmeal packets, variety of doughnuts, variety of bagles, toasters (with line), yogurt, bananas, and apples. We went between 9:30 and 10 each day (it closes at 10), and they hadn't run out of anything. Not enough seating at breakfast.6. Nice lobby.Highly recommend with caveats - the hotel could fix a few problems easily and make the experience better. I	
Apr 17 2009 	Average	It has comfort of being in main area of the manhatten city and close to times square.It's small but neat room, free internet wireless facility with morning breakfast &amp; gym.Little congested.but still good option for one who want to stay in the heart of the city and travelling for business or leisure.Location is just perfect.Jet Previlage Membership No. [--]	
Sep 9 2008 	Great Location and VALUE!!	Wow! I just had to leave a review for this little gem. I am a seasoned traveler, and have stayed at some of the best. But for this quick Fashion Week trip, I needed to stay within a budget, so booked here. My gal pal and I could not have been happier. The location is key, we walked to the tents at Bryant Park, the Rock, Bobby Flay's restaurant (Bar Americain, good but not great), and the Gershwin Theater (the last two in the rain!) and really felt we were central to all of our 'venues'. The room is clean, looks just like the photos. Comfy bed, and plenty of towels (a pet peeve of mine is skimpy towels~these were not and there were 4 bath towels each day). NICE LG flat screen, good AC, coffee maker a plus, in-room safe easy to use.The staff let us in at NOON, and since we were early, we got a room on the 4th floor as we had heard about the slow elevators. In reality, there were only a couple of times we were impatient for the lifts, mostly it was fine.I recommend watching the website and look for falling rates. I did, and the hotel honored the everlowering rates each time I called. I saved $70 per night by this method.We skipped the breakfast buffet, and instead went to Pret - A-Manger, a Brit cafe around the corner on 6th. GREAT FOOD and COFFEE! Bring lunch back to your room and save a bundle.In short, I'll be back. I'd rather spend my money on sightseeing and shopping then a fancy hotel. My sis stayed this same week at a pricier ($500 a night) place, and it was not much of a bigger room and the plumbing was awful!!Give the place a try. I think you will be satisfied. It was a total gamble for me, but paid off!!	
Mar 24 2009 	WOW	Wife and I stayed here from 3/13-3/17/09. What a GREAT place!! Everyone was very friendly and felt more like family atmosphere. Rooms were just right in size with ample closet space. Everything was very clean. I booked on quickbook and got a great rate. Being on 44th St between 5th and 6th avenue was awesome. Subway had 2 easily accessible subway stops to take you to all of Manhattan. Regina and her manager really shined. We hope to come back again as soon as possible.	
Oct 21 2008 	Positive experience	Just returned from a week's stay interrupted for two nights [went to woodstock] . Avoid the 11th fkoor inward rooms [not the ones on 44th st] as the noise of the outside compressors pours into and engulfs the room, especially at night time. We informed the staff about this. We hope the hotel manages to remedy this inconvenience.On returning we were upgraded to a suite which was what a suite should be; tastefully furnished and decorated, spacious and peaceful. What a contrast!The piece de resistance however are the staff. They were helpful, courteous, attentive and professional.Overall. if midtown is your destination the hotel is highly recommeded.	
May 10 2009 	Everything ok EXCEPT Those Doorman Police Whistles	Make sure your room does not face the street. All night long the doormen blast on police whistles looking for taxis	
Jul 6 2009 	Just what I was looking for	I picked this hotel because of its location and price, because I wanted to go to the Museum of Natural History, Central Park, and Zabar's. But I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel, considering it was under $200 a night on the upper west side (excluding parking).In Manhattan, I usually settle for a place that's clean and affordable. But this place was more than clean - it was nice. It was quite spacious for a NYC hotel, easily twice the size of the room we stayed last time near Times Square. The staff was friendly. Although not advertised, they were happy to bring us a crib and a small fridge when we asked, for no additional charge. I also heard they had free wireless internet, but I didn't use it.Overall, I was pleased with the choice we had made - definitely a great place for the price and location.	
Feb 23 2009 	Friendly clean great location!	I had a great stay at The Lucerne in Feb. 2009 --- the room was clean and comfortable and the location was unbeatable. The room may have been a little smaller than a standard hotel room, but hey, this is New York, and the space was more than adequate for one and would be perfectly fine for two. What I really enjoyed about my stay was the little perks: great shower products, always someone around in the lobby to answer questions and open the doors, 15% off breakfast at the connecting restaurant. I can't speak to value because my company was paying for it and I never saw the bill, but I would definitely stay here again assuming that the price is reasonable (as other commenters suggest it is).	
Aug 8 2008 	Excellent Hotel on the Upper West Side	This is a great hotel on the Upper West Side, and excellent value for money. It's within easy reach of the main attractions as there's a metro stop a block away, and Central Park and the Museum of Natural History are just a couple of blocks away. The Hotel is clean and beautifully furnished, we stayed in the smallest/cheapest grade of room (queen) and it was still a very reasonable size for a city. I couldn't fault anything about this hotel, and I would highly recommend staying here on a trip to NYC!	
Nov 18 2006 	Penthouse pampering	Prime location central to the best of everything in Manhattan. The penthouse suites are quiet and spacious. The managers are attentive and the lounge is a great place for pre or post dinner cocktails. The only minor setback is that the elevators to the 26th floor can be slow.	
Jun 21 2009 	Muy céntrico pero con mucho ruido		
May 5 2009 	Clean Modern Safe and recommended	I stayed here alone for 4 nights and it was around £280, which I think is great value. The area was good and things were in easy walking distance.The hotel was great, clean and nicely decorated. I didnt have a good view but it didnt really matter. They have 30 min of free internet access and free coffee upstairs in the business lounge.It was quiet and the staff were helpful.They have a roof terrace where you can see the empire state buidling.I would stay there again.	
Jul 22 2004	Would stay for business not for pleasure	The hotel looks far nicer and considerably more spacious when looking on Expedia. The front desk was friendly and helpful; unfortunately, the hotel furnishings (rooms and lobby included) remind me of worn IKEA furniture, which while modern, doesn't necessary make me want to stay there again. Other little things I noticed were stained drapes in my room as well as a bathroom air freshener (yes, those pastel disks that are in public bathrooms) stuck to the wall of the elevator. Hotel needs a facelift, but it's certainly cheap. I would stay there for business (to stay at a low cost hotel) if I had to, but would not choose this hotel for a leisure visit.	
Nov 24 2006 	Absolutely fabulous! Couldn't ask for better!!	Wow! That is the best way to describe this hotel. The staff were great, the mini bar is to die for and the room was bright, airy and very sophisticated (read other reviews...all true!). What we liked best was the lobby area, it was really relaxed, great for people watching. Because the lobby is exclusively reserved for guests of the hotel celebrities seem to flock to the mercer in their droves! Well worth the money, we will definately be returning!!	
Nov 17 2008 	Right on Times Square	We stayed at the Michelangelo for the second half of our NY stay in October/Nov 2008. The hotel is just around the corner from Times Square and only a block from the starting points of the NY Hop On/Hop Off bus tours which are a great way to see the city. The rooms by NY standards are quite large with very comfortable king beds. The staff were friendly enough, although we didnt really have to deal with them much as we spent some much time out of the hotel. Breakfast is complimentary crossaints and biscotti, with a variety of coffees - however juice is charged at $5US a glas (go figure). Overall, the hotel is clean, spacious and very convenient to all NY has to offer, we would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good base in NY.	
May 25 2008 	Keeping Up The Standards	It was 2 years since we last stayed at The Michelangelo and we are pleased to confirm that it is still a very comfortable and spacious place to stay.....a veritable 'oasis' of quietness and good service in the very heart of the theatre district, close by many attractions and only a short stroll to Central Park.We enjoyed a suite which had been recently refurbished and which afforded extremely commodious accomodation.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Michelangelo and send our thanks to all those who contributed to making this a memorable stay.	
Aug 22 2007	Look No Further	Although the rates are a bit on the steep side, The Michelangelo Hotel's level of comfort and accessibility to many major attractions more than makes up for the dent in the pocket.Whilst reception staff is nothing to shout about, upon arrival, you will immediately notice the lack of bustling crowds and the associated noise that comes with a typical 5 star mega hotel that NY has abundant of. Here, the lobby exudes a warm, cosy and welcome feel. An enclave from the bustling city that never sleeps. A shelter for your weary legs and a charger for your spirits as you prepare to explore the city and its secrets the next day.Rooms are spacious, of a good size, comfortable, private and above all, a perfect end to a hectic day. On a scale of 1-5, I would rate a 6! Having had the opportunity to view a room in another hotel not far off, I am able to say this with much confidence!!The hotel's location was also perfect. Right smack in the Broadway District, within close proximity to Times Square and a comfortable walking distance to anywhere really, this location is PRIME!!For the location and accessibility, quality of rooms and the cosy private feel of a high quality boutique establishment, it is well worth the price!!One tiny area for improvement is breakfast. Offer of coffee and croissants can be improved upon. The selection is - what selection??!! Where breakfast is concerned, you either go all the way, or offer nothing at all. That's my take!Otherwise, this is it, look no further!!	
Jul 4 2007 	FANTASTIC!!	A girls night out on the town in NYC. My neighbor and I had the most wonderful experience at The Michaelangelo. The room was hugh with two very comfortable queen beds. The linens and pillows were pristine. Clasical music was playing on the Bose stereo in our room when we arrived. We checked in a little early,(2:30pm.) The front desk couldn't do enough for us. They were so pleasent, helpful ,and kind. We had time to relax before dinner and the show. The bath room was immaculate, with huge fluffy soft towels. We asked for an ironing board and iron, it was brought to us before I could hang up the telephone. It was also extremely quiet. The coffee and pastries in the morning was a wonderful ending to our night out on the town. I reccomend this wonderful paradise in one of the busiest cities in the world.	
May 17 2007	Very Special	We stayed in the MichaelAngelo at the end of March 2007 for my partners 40th birthday. It was his first trip to NYC and I wanted it to be very special for him. I not only e mailed the hotel of the reason for our travel but I called them before we left the U.K. to check they had my message. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite and the whole NY experience began it's magic from that point. The staff were very pleasant, the accommodation was superb and I'm sad to see someone wrote a review saying they'd had a not very good experience, as my partner &amp; I are both rather well travelled and our stay at the MichaelAngelo will remain in our memories for a very long time to come for all the right reasons. The hotel will always be a place I'll rave about and recommend to anyone who will listen but judging by the other reviews, we weren't exceptionally lucky, the guy who gave the 1* rating must have simply been very very unfortunate. I wish he'd had the fantastic memories my partner &amp; I will keep forever. The hotel had a beautiful ambience and incredibly comfortable feel to it..... I'm going to stop going on now, as everytime I think about it, I could go on forever...	
Jan 3 2007 	Clean Quiet and a Great Location	Location is excellent, as is housekeeping staff. Would definitely consider hotel for future NYC visit.	
Jun 19 2005	il fascino di vecchio mondo a New York	Loved this hotel! If you enjoy small, old world, hotels then this is your hotel. The staff was welcoming and attentive. The work out room was better than most. The morning coffee in the lobby was a delightful plus (although the fare is typical muffins, not Italian pasties, but still lovely). I would not recommend this hotel for fans of the W, but would if you like to go back to a timeless age.	
Jul 5 2007 	A wonderful hotel in a great location!!!	We searched high and low for a hotel for our first family vacation in 9 years. Let me tell you, the hotel webstie does not do justice to this great hotel. The rooms (1 BR suite) were large and comfortable, the kitchen was small but very usable (saved a ton on breakfasts), the master bedroom had a king size bed with what felt just like our tempur-pedic mattress, and the kids said that the pull out queen bed was comfy. The neighborhood was awesome and safe (with a great market just around the corner and a great place to eat called Nicks that delivers), the hotel staff was super friendly and helpful. When we go back next year, there is not another place that we will even consider. Subway 3 blks away, central park 2 blocks away. STAY HERE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!	
May 27 2008 	Fantastic Hotel and Location	We just stayed over Memorial weekend. The Muse is a wonderful property 1/2 block from Times Square. I am glad the hotel didn't open onto the hustle and bustle, but a quaint, safe, sidestreet. Most theaters, shopping, Central Park, The Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Radio Center Music Hall were a quick, safe, walk. For farther sights, there was a subway station 1 block away. The staff was wonderful and the room looked just like the pictures online. Really a great Boutique hotel. I liked the smaller more personal feeling as opposed to the big mega hotels of Times Square. The free wine reception every evening was great! Also free coffee and tea in the a.m. downstairs also. I had booked a Deluxe King through the hotel itself, but mentioned it was our 18th anniversary. We were upgraded to an executive suite (wonderful) and had a plate of snacks and a mini bottle of champagne upon arrival. We had a parlour and a bedroom, each with its own climate control. The bed was the most comfortable I think I have ever slept in. Heaven! We had a good view. There was construction below our room, but they didn't work on the weekend, so it was only a little noisy Friday afternoon. That didn't bother us at all, as the room was so great and we were just dropping off stuff and getting ready to head out again. Just a note - the minibar has sensors, so if you open it and move something you may get charged. We had the charge removed without a problem, but if you don't need to, just leave the minibar closed. There are little cafes and shops that are nearby. They also arranged for tickets to a Broadway show for us. The TKTS is a good deal, but not all shows are there and you have to be willing to wait in line for 2 or more hours. We felt with our limited time in NY, we would rather pay more and not have to stand in line. Plan ahead if you don't want to wait or pay a premium price.Also, a great experience was the NY Waterways Yankee Clipper. It was a 2 hour harbor cruise each way to Yankee Stadium. At only $22 per person, it was well worth the price for the views and the ease of leaving the stadium! Fun, but chilly after dark so bring a jacket unless it is a steamy night!	
Jan 24 2008 	Fantastic find - great location	Great little boutique hotel. Room was large, clean and very comfortable. Hotel is a 2 minute walk from Time Square. Staff were friendly - nothing too much trouble. Can thouroughly recommend this hotel. Will stay here again.	
Dec 12 2004	Just Perfect	We stayed at The Muse Dec 2 - 6 First time in New York and loved it. Rooms were large, bed was very comfy - every thing was just perfect. Staff were polite, helpfull and effecient and we would recommend this hotel to everyone.	
Jun 12 2009 	Rooms: great - atmosphere: a bit stuck up	I was in town for a conference but since my wife was joining me, chose more of a tourist location. Hotel was v presentable in good spot close to most of the tourist areas without being right on top of them. Room itself was great-clean, comfortable, smart and spacious. The doorman who showed us to our room was excellent. One day, our safe wouldnt open. I had left my laptop in it and needed it urgently for a conference that afternoon. Staff were great and sorted it immediately. Sadly, other staff were a bit off-hand. A couple of doormen in particular, made it clear that they were very put out at receiving tips of a few dollars for the most menial of tasks (not something I'd experienced at other hotels in NY). Also, I used the hotel internet room to print a 5 page doc for work at $1 per page (steep)! When my bill arrived though, I was charged $10. When I queried it, I was told that this was a flat rate for each time you used the room. While it hardly breaks the bank, Id have preferred to have known in advance. This is my 4th time in NYC; I've stayed in different spots each time. Overall, this hotel was very good &amp; the room was probably the best I've stayed in NY so far but the issues with the staff did bother me and would put me off staying here again. While it may seem like I'm knitpicking, I don't like being made to feel uncomfortable. Last time I stayed in a Club Quarters. The room wasn't as nice but I think I preferred it - the atmosphere was more relaxed and they didn't charge you for every tiny thing!	
May 14 2009 	GREAT HOTEL I will stay again!!	It's a great hotel. It's not the most flashy or new, but it is cozy, CLEAN, the employees are really friendly. The beds are great, and the bathrooms are spacious. The concierge service is awesome. The front desk is great too. We took a Carmel Car from JFK and paid in advance including the tip only $59. The same price we would have paid for a Taxi. When we got there, the doorman, kind of worried, asked us how much did he charged us. I told him, and he was relieved.The first night they gave us a room in the 6th floor. The next morning I asked to be changed to a higher floor, because of the view. The front desk changed us without any question. When we got to the new room in the 22nd floor the front desk called there to ask if that room was ok. The gym in the hotel is great. It's on the 6 floor, and it has some nice new cardio and weight training machines, clean towels too. Be careful with the water fridge, I sure they will charge a lot to the room. Everyday I used the free wi-fi in my laptop, excellent connection. And a PLUS is that the safe inside the closet it's big enough to fit a big laptop. I have a Dell Widescreen, and it fits great.The second day we got all wet because of the rain and the Concierge gave us a nice umbrella. It's close to everything, Grand Central, UN, Times Square is a 15 minutes walk away. There's a 24 hour CVS Pharmacy in the next corner, if you need something, including beer (LOL), there it is 24 hours. At night there's a staff person checking the keys to let you into the elevators, that's great. The down side its the air conditioner, it didn't work quite well, and we never turned it off, but it never got that cold. LIKE ALL THE REVIEWS, STAY AWAY FROM THE MINIBAR!!! Since I read all the comments about the prices of it, we didn't even looked at it. I saw that it has a weight sensor or something, if you remove something for 20 seconds it will be charged. I didn't even looked at the menu, that has the prices, and we had no problem.I'm going back in a couple of months, this is the hotel I will book. The staff is really really great. We had a great time in the City and the hotel was a big part of it. Since we booked a package through Priceline I thought we could have some problems. NOT AT ALL! Everything was smooth. I would totally recommend this hotel to everyone.	
Jan 19 2009 	Fabulous	Stayed for 3 nights in March 2008 and was really impressed overall with this hotel. The room was spotless the bed was nicely made up daily The reception staff were polite and friendly as were the bar staff. We looked at the resteraunt but chose not to eat there as there was so much else nearby. The prices in the resteraunt are not overly expensive its just that there are some really nice eateries nearby The negative comments on these reviews cannot possibly be about this hotel and must be either a mistake or malicious. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definately stay there again.	
Apr 5 2008 	Good Location Good Hotel	Arrived at the hotel with pal, exhausted &amp; looking forward to taking a much-needed nap but the smoking room booked wasn't ready. Apparently there's only one floor of smoking room in the whole hotel. We were earlier than the check-in time so had a couple of cocktails at Harry's Bar, where the 15% gratuity is added automatically! Returned to check-in a couple of hours later but still no smoking room ready so we accepted a non-smoking room instead and were assured it was a nice city view room - it was on the 30th floor, we could see the Chrysler and were delighted to find we had two beds instead of one to share. The hotel's staff were always very helpful and the bar was friendly. The beds were extremely comfortable and the in-room safe was a plus. Pax Deli next door to the hotel is ok for breakfast but if you walk up to the Pershing Sq Cafe (less than 5 mins, same side of road) they do a fabulous breakfast and it has a great atmosphere. The Capital Grille just a couple of mins up the road on the other side does a really nice dinner; it's not cheap but the staff are attentive and it's a pleasant treat. In the other direction is McFadden's Bar which serves some lovely fish dishes. You should have a cocktail at The View bar in the Mariott on Times Square, the views really are great &amp; if you go for the sunset it's really quite pretty. Overall the hotel's location is great with Times Sq about 15 min walk and 5th Ave shopping a bit less. We thought Macy's was ok but Bloomingdales was the prettiest and brightest department store and Century 21 is worth a visit for past-season designer goods but is fairly chaotic.	
Mar 29 2008 	Travel Agent Review	FABULOUS hotel!!!!This was my first trip to New York, on my own!!! for acouple of days to get a feel for the place, shops (LOTS!!!!), tourist spots etcThis has a fab location opp the chrsyler building, its a 5mins walk to times sq, empire state bluiding, bloomies, macys etc, the room was large with plasma screen tv and wireless internet, I was upgraded to a empire room where I has a view of the empire building.All the staff are friendly and polite and the restaurant and bars are not too badly priced. The lifts aren't too bad I was on the top floor (42nd) and it took less than a minute to reach.This is a good 4 star hotel with a fantastic large feel to it, just what you need in New York!!	
Mar 24 2008	Very old and worn hotel	Stayed at the Helmsley last week for a business trip and was very dissapointed. It feels like it hasn't been updated since the 80s and is definitely not appropriate for business travel. The lobby feels like a depressing airport bar and the rooms have none of the amenities that you would expect in 2008. Its like being in a time warp. No bottles of water in the room, no mini bar, no vending machines, no decent shampoo. It might be ok if you are travelling on a budget and want a convenient hotel in NYC but I think that the Westin is around the same price and it feels like a contemporary hotel.Overall, the core basics are there but it is in dire need of a remodel.	
Jan 9 2008 	A fantastic time in the Big Apple!	My friend decided to celebrate her birthday in style and visit NY with 5 of her closest friends, for Thanksgiving in November!Our trip lasted 4 whole days and what a time we had! Being a seasoned traveller to New York but not having stayed at the Helmsley before, both me and my friends were very pleased with the hotel and services it provided. The rooms were comfortable, recently renovated and our requests for three rooms 'close together' was completely fulfilled in that our rooms were next door to each other on the same floor, with views of the Chrysler building right outside. Fantastic! We ate a light supper one evening in the hotel's restaurant where the food was great and service even better! We utilised Pax deli on more than one occasion - a great place to stop off for breakfast before hitting the shops! Thanksgiving is a fantastic time to visit NY - we had a brilliant viewpoint for the Macy's Day Parade and enjoyed the bargains in the shops on the Friday. Not to mention the sights. We just ran out of time..! We thoroughly recommend the NY Helmsley when visiting this fanstastic city.	
Oct 16 2009 	Would definitely stay here again	4th visit in NYC; stayed at Red Roof Inn (RRI) 2 previous times but rates there have significantly increased. Booked the New Yorker at a cheaper rate than RRI (Travelocity special), same area of Manhattan but far nicer amenities. Completely renovated and refurbished Art Deco hotel with history. Rooms are good size for New York. Bathrooms are clean and fair sized (however, little room to place toiletries). Bed is very comfortable (I haven't experienced this in a hotel in a long time) though there is some noise outside at night (frequent police and other sirens). The free internet is surprisingly fast. Near most subway lines and walking distance to Macy's (across the street), Times Square, Theater District, etc. You can't go wrong, whether it's for business or leisure.	
May 23 2009 	Perfect location	This is the perfect location to stay in New York for a sightseeing trip with Times Square, Macey and the Empire State Building in one direction and Madison Square Garden the other. Close to Penn Station and the subway for a short ride the other parts of town for Central Park, Wall Stree and ferry for Statue of Liberty.The rooms have recently been re-furbished. We had a standard twin room, lovely big beds with quality mattresses and lovely soft pillows, very good nights sleep .The room was not very big it was adeqate for the 4 day stay. It was clean and well decorated. Really impressed that within 10 minutes of arriving in our room reception rang to ask if everything was okay. We were then offerred complimentary tea and coffee in the room. this really made a difference and we just had to ask for re-fills each day. There is a diner attached to the hotel on one side and a restauraunt on the other which is handy if you are too tired to look around for somewhere to eat. My friend and I felt very safe in this hotel, the staff were friendly and security was discreet but stringent at all times. I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel and will definately choose it again if I have the opporuntity to return to New York.	
Jul 13 2009 	The Plaza - best out of three	I'll keep this brief:I went to three hotels in my trip to NYC - The Grammercy Park hotel, The Waldorf Towers and the Plaza.By far the Plaza was outstanding for service, freindliness, location, presentation and just overall coolness.On arrival, Joseph accompanied me and carried my luggage to my room. He was possibly the friendliest person I had come across since arriving at NYC. He seemed to really be interested in my travels and showed me round the newly refurbished room with great pride. He clearly cares about his job and his customers. As a side note, the next day he remembered my name which I found impressive.All of the staff reflected this level of service and non stuffy friendliness, which I'm afraid Waldorf Towers staff were sadly lacking. (In fact I would go as far as to warn people away from the Towers)The Plaza is beautifully located on the corner of Central Park and their food is first rate. The rooms are beautiful, not at all &quot;Vegas&quot; in my opinion (as some previous reviewers have suggested.On one of the evenings I went to a broadway show and they insisted at the door that I went in the house car for free. The house car is a black rolls royce.... I can tell you that it was the ultimate feel good touch and I felt like the king of New York as I got out at the theatre...My advice - if you want a NYC experience for a few days with the wow factor, forget the others and just book the Plaza and say hi to Joseph for me.	
Apr 16 2009 	Great Budget Hotel	This hotel is right in the centre of Manhattan. We found it to be small and clean. It is a pain not having en suite toilet etc but not too inconvenient. Towels are a bit on the small side. Other reviews have mentioned noise but we found it to be really quiet. It is ideal if you want to get out an about.	
Oct 23 2008 	a modern budget alternative	I agree with a previous review that succinctly summed up the stay at the Pod as &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot; This was an OK place, definitely cheaper than expensive alternatives in NY, and modern, full of young energy, with free wireless. Folks at the front desk were nice and helpful. However, the rooms are called &quot;pods&quot; for a reason -- my room, with a double bed, was smaller than my college dorm room was back in the day :-) The temperature seemed a bit hard to regulate, I could hear neighbors through the walls, the bed was on the hard side, the sink was tiny, and the gross moment of the stay was the roach that crawled across the ledge, right next to the bed. Would I stay here again? I don't know -- I think I may be a little spoiled by staying at nicer places due to much business travel, but if I was, say younger than 30, and on a budget, sure, I'd stay here in a second.	
Aug 28 2008 	Loved the stay	I stayed in a single room with shared bath. Have absolutely hothing bad to say about the hotel. Due to really late arrival from my side, they had let my room go the first night, but they accomodate me in a doubleroom with private bath the first night. I cannot understand the comments about the size of the rooms. Sure, the bathroom in the double room was on the small side. But the room was larger than most European and definitive several others more expensice New York hotel room. The single room had plenty of room for one persons baggage and clothes. Had no problem with the share bathroom (that is so much larger then the private baths). Only time when it actually where a queue was one night at 3am...Perfect location with great restuarants and subway just around the corner. Will definitely stay there again!	
Aug 26 2008 	Will definitely stay here again! Loved The Pod	We stayed at The Pod in Dec 07. Booked a double room with en suite bathroom at The Pod after much research on Tripadvisor and we were definitely not disappointed. Finding clean, affordable accommodation in a convenient and safe location in NYC can be difficult... and we were glad that once again, we trusted in this website. The room was very clean, with lots of little hidey spaces to keep stuff and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was tiny, but the water was hot (a great relief in winter!) and more importantly (for me, a TV addict), I could still watch the news whilst washing my face and putting on my make-up! I have always been apprehensive about shared bathrooms, and like many other reviewers on this site, checked out the shared bathrooms during my stay and they were ALWAYS clean (the tiles were gleaming!) and usually one or two were available. I was very impressed. If I was not so finicky about sharing bathrooms, I will opt for this in a New York minute! The location was great. Very close to the subway, with lots of food options nearby. We ordered takeaway once from the menus placed in the room and had no problems - it came quickly and was still piping hot. Most importantly for me, The Pod is within walking distance from the shopping areas. I could walk to Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Sephora, the list goes on. As we were there during Christmas, it was also nice to be within walking distance from Rockefeller Centre and the cathedral.	
Nov 2 2008 	Perfect location excellent service	Stayed four nights at the Ritz Carlton (Central Park South) with my 12yo daughter.The location of the Hotel is terrific, at walking distance from 5th Avenue and the shopping area.As soon as we arrived we felt pampered and welcomed by all the personnel, from the doormen to the receptionists (theye even knew my daughter's name!).We had one dedicated person who showed us our room and all the Hotel facilities.Coming from a long flight from Europe we wanted to have room-service dinner.It has been fast, good and accurate.So was the breakfast the morning after.The concierges are a real &quot;treasure&quot;: they suggested us very very good restaurants for our dinners and have been a very good help for everything in NY.The SPA (products La Prairie) is simply luxurious.Only negative note: on our departure day we had a snack at the Hotel Bar and the service was extremely long....Overall this Hotel is a bit expensive, but service, quality of the room and personnel are so good...Would highly recommend it.	
Feb 5 2003	The Best		
Mar 11 2009 	Great location but shabby place	This is really well located in central Manhattan but it is in desperate need of a refurb, and in fact simply looks shabby. The room we stayed in was extremely cramped and noisy (although to be fair, you have to expect this in Manhattan!).It wasn't unpleasant and didn't ruin the holiday, I would just expect a lot better for the money	
Feb 24 2009 	good value clean and comfortable	This was my husband and I's 2nd stay at the Roosevelt. We had previously stayed there for new year's eve 2007-2008 and got upgraded to a king minisuite. This time we weren't so lucky, but the room was nice anyway. We were on the 9th floor and it was a bit of street noise on Friday afternoon but it was quiet in Saturday. It was clean and decently sized for NYC, and the bed was very comfortable. The towels were thick and the water pressure in the shower was great. We got a special deal that included free breakfast vouchers in the dining room. The food was adequate, with a good choice of hot dishes such as eggs, bacon, sausages, waffles, pancakes, and the usual cereal, bagels, toast, and juice or coffee. What we weren't told was that they charge you a $12 gratuity when you use the vouchers...and we had left a cash tip on the table. Oh well. Also, this hotel charges for internet service, which, for the price of the rooms, I think should be free. Regardless, the location is great, the staff is very friendly and we would definitely stay here again.	
Jan 16 2009 	Great outside poor inside	Great position, in the heart of midtown Manhattan, in front of Grand Central Station.Great hall and nice gym.Really really small and old room, bathroom awful. Considering that I payed about 220$ per room per night.Be aware that you will be asked to tip to:1) take your luggage from the street to the elevator2) take your luggage from the elevator to the room3) take your luggage inside the deposit4) take your luggage outside of the depositThis is way too much for me.	
Jul 15 2008 	Great location!	We stayed over at the Roosevelt beginning of May. The Hotel is splendid, huge entrance, very impressive. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room wasn't very big but when you visit NYC you don't stay in your room all day. So for us it was perfect! The bed was a king size with loads of different pillows, the room was cleaned everyday. In other word, we enjoyed staying there and we would probably go back.	
Jul 10 2008 	Loved the Roosevelt	This is a beautiful, classic hotel! We found a very reasonable rate on the hotel website ($179 for a cozy queen) and after reading the reviews on tripadvisor, I was really worried. The other reviews are completely wrong! Our room was clean, quite big for NYC and had THE most comfortable bed! The bathroom was small but normal for an older hotel, and there really was plenty of room for toiletries and such. The staff were great...they were all very helpful and accommodating - they made us feel like VIPs everywhere we went. They have a nice lounge/bar right next to the lobby There's also a great new rooftop bar that you must visit, even if you don't stay at the hotel. Not only that, but you are across the street (literally) from Grand Central! It was so easy getting around town, I think we only took a cab twice and those were late at night. I really can't say anything bad about this hotel. We can't wait to go back!	
May 18 2007 	Good value and great location	Booked the hotel on Travelocity. Advertised as a four star hotel tho I'm not sure it quite rates that way. I would put it at a 3.5. Rooms are small as indicated by other reviewers, however, they are clean, modern and well laid out. Bathroom was tiny but never felt that way. We had a two bedroom suite. Two parents, two kids. Perfect for a family tho parents should note that the bedrooms have no doors. TV's are modern HDTV flat screen wall mounts. No pay per view but full cable. Staff was helpful. There is no concierge per se but the front desk staff were very knowledgeable and helped with reservations, etc. Room service was lightning quick. Food was pretty good for the one meal we ate in the room. No ice machine but no charge for room service delivery. What would bring me back to this hotel is the location. Two blocks south of Central Park South. What more can you say?	
Jul 3 2006	Mixed Bag	My wife and I sought a luxury hotel with a slightly lower price tag than the highest in the NY. The Shoreham's location is great for shopping and walking to theater. The staff is young, hip and tries hard, although a few looked too much like bouncers. Our suite had a decent sitting room with an uncomfortable sofa and a bizarre exercise chair that resembeld a Lazy-Boy. It did work. The bedroom was not good. There was only one end table by the bed. The cloest was tiny, but spacious compared to the bathroom. It couldn't have been more than 30 square feet. No room for toiletries or your feet. Impossibly claustraphobic. I guess you get what you pay for!	
Jul 9 2005	EXCELLENT VALUR	The Shoreham is a small boutique hotel which was under rennovation at the time of our visit. Be sure to reserve &quot;inside rooms&quot; in the new section as an outside room can be very noisy - street noise. The room are small but extremely comfortable and clean. The service is excellent. Given the ever increasing rates of New York City Hotels, the Shoreham was a &quot;value&quot; however the rates will o doubt increase once the new section is completed. Probably the biggest &quot;positive&quot; of this hotel is the location which is a half block off fifth avenue. Yes, we would stay there again!!	
Dec 2 2004	Nice but not worth its 4 stars	My fiance and I booked a night's stay on Nov. 27th, '04 through Hotwire and got the room for about $200. We requested a room on the rennovated side based on the reviews we read here and they graciously accomodated; we also got a glass of champagne on check-in. There was some problem with our Hotwire reservation but they handled it all directly with Hotwire and gave us no trouble. The lobby and design of the hotel was clean and modern; likewise our room, though fairly unadorned and only looking out on a light cellar. The bathroom only had a shower but it was a large one and the aveda products were nice. But the hotel didn't have some fairly basic things, like robes, mini-bar, a table and chairs in the room, that I would definitely expect from a four star hotel. It was closer to a nice Best Western than what I would expect from NY boutique hotels.The room service menu looked tasty, as well as the breakfast menu that you could order to be delivered the night before. However, here was our real problem -- we went to what we thought was the complimentary continental breakfast the next morning in the dining room and each had a bowl of cereal and some coffee and when we got up to leave we were presented w/ a bill for $34. As it turns out, there is NO breakfast provided by the hotel, call me cheap but even the Ho Jo offers that and $17 per person for coffee and cereal is absurd. We talked to the manager who adjusted it to only charge for one person but we still left feeling like somehow it all just didn't add up to an above average experience. I would recommend The Library Hotel a THOUSAND times over this one and it's very comprably priced with all of the niceties this one lacks.	
Apr 2 2004	nice hotel	I was worried after reading some negative reviews on this property but we were pleased with our stay. First the negatives: the water in the rooms cost $5.00 a bottle, the there is no on-site workout facilities, they no longer offer free breakfast and the rooms are small. Some travel web sites say the water and breakfast is free. As far as room size- all the rooms I've had in NY have been small, Shoreham's were about average. Plus we were on the 2nd floor and had no street noise. The location was great- nice quiet street close to the F line. (it was a 12 block walk to Times Square) It would have been nice to be closer to the other subway lines but it was close to 5th Ave shopping, central park MOMA and St Peter. The staff was great- very helpful, one example was when I called to get information on the UN building, even though the Concierge was closed, the front desk person looked up the info on the spot, plus had a schedule printed and delivered to our room.	
Oct 19 2009 	Outstanding	We visit NYC twice a year and always stay at the St Regis. It is incredible. The service is unparallelled; the rooms are large; the bathrooms luxurious....I could go on. Even the workout room is great, albeit small. My only complaint is the bar is overpriced but that's the going rate in the area. Have champagne delivered by the concierge and enjoy it in your fabulous room!	
Jun 24 2004	Classic Luxury		
Sep 26 2009 	The best experience I have had in NY	The Standard was recommended to me by a friend before it even opened its front doors. I booked online- and got the most amazing rate. My first impression of the hotel was of the doorman who had a smile and a helping hand. The receptionist was efficient and helpful. And the rooms....were the best I have ever stayed in in the Big Apple- the view was typically New York. At night the hotel rocked with the hippest bar and restaurant in town, with that in mind- there was no disturbance in hte main hotel rooms at all.All in all- the best experience in NY.	
Aug 20 2009 	Terrible room	I have stayed at this hotel and had a decent room for the price, This time the room was awful. Very small (Stress very) old, chipped paint, bathroom was barely big enough for one, hot water took forever and the air conditioning made alot of noise. This time we got the hotel through hotwire, perhaps that was the reason they gave us such a horrific room. The entrance and bar very retro and cool but it is a real gamble to book a room here.	
Mar 5 2006	Great Location / Great Service	My boyfriend and I stayed at The Time Hotel for 9 nights during February 2006. The location is awesome and the service was great. The rooms are a bit small but overall were pretty modern, comfortable and clean. The concept of rooms decorated in either red, yellow or blue colour schemes works well. However, it may be time to revamp the linen. Polyester bedspreads are a no no - YUK. The hotel needs to invest in some quality cotton and luxurious comforters and goose/duck down pillows as the existing pillow were pretty uncomfortable. Overall, we were happy with the quality of The Time Hotel and would stay there again on the above proviso i.e. a crucial linen and pillow update.	
Sep 1 2009 	Buon piazzamento ma stanze piccole e non curate		
Aug 11 2009	W=A is wow=awesome.	We travelled with a bus tour which we booked through Travac, an Ottawa travel agent located in the Westgate Shopping Plaza. Our tour included 4 days and 3 nights at the Waldorf=Astoria in the Theatre District of Central Manhatten, New York City. The price was exceptionally affordable and included 2 tour guides, a video of the Waldorf =Astoria, and a 4 hour tour of Manhatten. We opted to start with a deep tissue massage at the Guerlain Spa on the 19th floor. This included a wonderful foot massage while we completed our questionnaire. We found all the W=A staff to be professional, sincere, respectful and very friendly. Our room, although small, was opulant, with marbled bathroom and a walk in closet big enough to dress in. I would advise requesting a room located near the central air shaft to avoid the street noise from below. In the business centre behind reception, we discovered free internet access for 10 minutes. The gift shop where you can purchase newspapers is also behind reception. Starbucks is located beside the front door on Park Ave., perfect for a quick breakfast. We ended our stay with a tour of the hotel and viewed the beautiful ballroom and the 4 kitchens which span the length of an entire city block. This is a world reknown hotel which houses state visits from queens, kings and presidents. Well worth the stay.	
	Enjoyed it and will be back	We loved the location and the wonderful service and nice rooms. We have stayed here on our last four trips to New York and we will continue to stay here on our next visit.	
Nov 12 2008 	Great hotel and location	I took my wife here for a romantic getaway for the weekend. This is a really nice hotel. We arrived really late after our flight was delayed and they checked us in quickly. A representative (and representative in training) showed us to our room and carried our luggage. Complementary internet, bottled water. Things I expect in an upscale hotel. We had a corner room with a nice view and a king bed. The room and bathroom were a nice size. I've heard that rooms at some hotels in NY are rather small. The location of the hotel could not be better. One block off Times Square and only a few blocks from some broadway theaters. I stayed here using Star Points. Before I decided to use Star Points, I was comparing prices of this hotel to others nearby and it's competitive and reasonable given the type of hotel and location. I hope to get back here.	
Oct 12 2009 	I definetily recommend...	Me and my brother stayed at Thirty Thirty for 2 days on our first trip to NY. We booked through Orbitz which gave us a standard room but only guaranteed a Queen bed, although brothers we definetily preferred separate beds and one call to the hotel got our needs accommodated. Great location, center of Manhatan, close to subway and easy to move anywhere. Room was very clean and comfortable.	
Jul 29 2009 	Home Away from Home at Thirty Thirty	Unless you are very wealthy -- and few of us are -- just thinking about booking a hotel room in New York City can be depressing. This is the land of $300 a night, tiny, tiny mousetrap hotel rooms that try to make up for what happens behind your door by having an opulent lobby. It's not opulent, but I like the lobby at the Thirty Thirty Hotel. It is contemporary and functional. And, like the hotel itself, it has everything I need at a price I can afford.Get one of the King rooms if you are traveling with your spouse and what you will have is a home away from home getaway spot with a really comfy bed, high-end bedding, lots of light when you want it (and total dark when you want it) a nice seating area and desk and a really cool bathroom. Love the baths here. Marble and glass showers with fantastic shower heads. Nice soaps and great lotion, too. High--end products at a budget price. So relaxing at the end of a hard day of being a NYC tourist. It's not the Ritz. But its not supposed to be. The Thirty Thirty is in a neighborhood with lots of delis and family owned restaurants and little cafes and standard issue Starbucks nearby. It is really close to the sights, like the NY Public Library and the Empire State Building. And it is right on a subway line that takes you anywhere you want to go. There are also some highend restaurants close by on Park and they make for a perfect special night out for you and someone you love. But at the end of the day, you'll enjoy coming &quot;home.&quot; The staff is not at all intrusive but there is always someone around who will say &quot;hello&quot; or offer help if you need something. There's a great little restaurant right downstairs that serves everything from a cheap and filling breakfast to late night eats and a night cap. There's no free internet service. But you can pay for it in your room or go down to the communal pay stations in the lobby. I have stayed here three times now; once with my daughter when she was a teen and interviewing with colleges, once alone on business, and most recently with my husband when we attended a convention. I always have a complaint about something. But honestly, I cannot say anything bad about this place. Each time, the Thirty Thirty was the perfect spot.	
Aug 20 2008 	Funky boutique hotel an overstatement	Stayed two nights for a business trip. Good proximity to downtown businesses and not far from Chelsea for good restaurants. Nearby the hotel are lots of places to grab coffee, bagels, and fruit and close to Broadway toward toward Union Square. There is a restaurant adjacent to the hotel that I didn't try. My room was a twin on the top floor which felt like an attic with narrow passageway and very small &quot;L&quot; shape room. A window had a large crack in it but it was taped up. Front desk staff was a bit surly. Rate for a Sunday night was a great deal at $178 but the rate jumped up to $268 the second night before adding numerous taxes which translates into a $300 room. The other rooms might have been more ample. Would I recommend it? Probably yes for under $200/night if you want to stay on the East Side but not over $250/night.	
Jan 6 2009 	Tolles Hotel in genialer Umgebung		
Nov 16 2008	Great location fair hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights to run the New York Marathon and arrived on Halloween, which was great - a buzzing city. We went as part of a package with Sports Tours UK.The Travel Inn is not a lodge type hotel and is not connected to the Travel Inn group. It is part of the Empire Hotels group. The hotel is located in Manhatten on 42nd Atreet, between 9th and 10th Ave. A few min walk to Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue etc. The location is very good for getting around.Our rooms on the 7th and 8th floors were adequate, with all required amenities but faded and rather small, but I suppose a fair size for a major city centre hotel.Bathroom adequate, but again small and faded. There is no bar or restaurant, but there are numerous places to eat within 2 min walk. The outdoor pool looked nice, but we did not check the temperature. Large supermarket on the same block. Police station opposite, which can give some siren noise, but no more than any other hotel in New York - it's not a quiet city.Our only problem was that the 2 small lifts seemed to be in permanant use and we had to wait ages all of the time.A fairly non discript hotel, but in a good location for a few nights. Cannot comment on the value, as it was part of a package with flights, race entry etc. Sports Tours use it every year.N&amp;B	
May 19 2005	Travel Inn	Stayed here 29/4 for 4 nights with family on a last minute trip which left our usual choice of hotel (Hyatt Grand Central) unavailable. Was a bit worried about the area before I arrived, but glad to say that the surrounding area is busy with plenty of people around which is reassuring at night. Found this hotel about the same walking distance from 42nd st/Times Square as the Hyatt. The hotel itself is fine, rooms are comfortable and fairly large for New York. House keeping was good the room was spotless every day. As previous reviewers have stated the two guys on the front desk can be a bit abrupt, but we mostly dealt with the two woman receptionists who were brilliant nothing was a hassle, any time I asked a question they treated me like a person not an annoyance, a very bad habit the Hyatt rececption staff have developed. My only complaint was the street noise, we had a room at the front and my young brother is a light sleeper which caused problems. On the whole if we could get a room at the back I would stay here again. Although not Hyatt standard, the staff are friendlier also the big advantage is that this hotel is a lot cheaper which means more money to spend in the shops.	
Aug 17 2006	Loved it.	Ok, so its a five star hotel, costs a bomb, but you expect the best. It certainly lived up to our expectations. When we were checking in, we mentioned to the receptionist that we were getting married in the city a few days later. She came up trumps (excuse the pun), and promply gave us one of the best suites in the hotel. Top floor, Central Park, and Columbus Circle view. We had already paid for the view, but we had not paid for a suite, but got one anyway due to our special occasion. It was HUGE! Much bigger than our house at home! Which is a nice surprise as hotel rooms in New York are notoriously small. It had a seperate guest toilet, kitchen, two walk in wardrobes, big bedroom with central park view, main bathroom with seperate vanity area, and big living room with floor to ceiling views of both Central Park, and Columbus Circle. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, and they were all polite and friendly without being intrusve. Overall, very impressed!	
Jul 23 2007 	Review of the Tudor Hotel	Hotel itself was really good. Very clean. Jim at the conceirge desk was awesome. Everything he recommended to us was top notch.ProblemsCheck-in was really slow. And then they gave us a room that was occupied by someone else. The front desk apologized, sent us to another room. An upgrade or a rate adjustment would have been nice. Especially since we could have walked into a room where people could have been &quot;busy.&quot;If you are in the north tower, they only have 1 ice machine at it's on the second floor. If you are on the higher levels, it's a pain. The south tower has three ice machines.	
Jan 15 2007 	Very Good Experience	I booked several months in advance for an overnight stay, and was not sure what to expect given the reviews. I trusted it would be just 'OK', but it turned out to be a very good experience. I added a friend onto the reservation, and the hotel did not charge for the change in persons per room, as I had been told may occur.The front desk volunteered to find a room with separate beds, again a deviation from my reservation but immediately taken care of.We enjoyed the rooms: modern, clean and comfortable. As travelers with certain dietary needs, upon our request we were promptly given the name and number of a particular food establishment. This took place while still signing in.The internet capability was a bonus. It could be said to be a bit expensive at $14.95 a day. Well, that is the price we pay as professionals who need the service, or as people who just want the luxury of instant access to the world. All staff was courteous and helpful, and made our trip to New York City a positive one. I would definitely stay there again.	
Jun 15 2009 	Great hotel great location	We were pleasantly surprised by the Vincci Avalon. We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of June 09. Upon arrival we were given a deluxe suite, which is what we booked. Unfortunately, it didn't have a king size bed (2 doubles), so they upgraded us to an executive suite. Having seen both rooms, there isn't much of difference--both are nice and spacious. The executive suite has a formal foyer and bidet in the bathroom.We were impressed with the size of the room and the large and luxurious bathroom. We had free wireless internet service (which worked adequately, unlike some reviewers' experiences).We loved the location. The hotel is one block from Korea Town with many excellent dining options, and only two blocks to Herald Square. There is a major subway station at Herald Square where you can access most subway lines, and another subway station a block and a half east of the hotel.Overall, we were pleasantly surprised and would stay here again in the future.	
Mar 10 2008 	loved it - i am surprised by the bad reviews	ok, it was a couple of years ago now and i cannot account for what the hotel is like now, but i had a brilliant stay. I stayed at the Avalon for 4 nights with my cousin, aunt and grandmother. Room was very clean, the shower was lovely, very powerful unlike other hotels. beds were made everyday, maid cleaned everyday. Breakfast was delicious! continental breakfast also included cakes.My aunt and cousin returned to the Avalon Nov 2007 and said they had a similar experience to the years before and i am hopeing to book to go back again this year.	
Aug 28 2006 	Great!	It was my first time staying in New York City. With all the different places to stay i chose the W. Located in a very &quot;posh posh&quot; location i was impressed. Going into the lobby it was very dark, yet modern and chique. Great service and friendly workers. Elevator can be cramped with 3 large suitcases and other people. When we arrived on our floor, it was a little to small to move around . However when we g ot to our room we were suprised to find that it was small. I made the expcetion that it was new york, known for tiny apartements, so why would a hotel be different. Yet plain white walls didn't excatly help the fell and the vibe of the room. Going into the bathroom and ubstruct step made me lose my balance. The queen beds (2) were small, considering in Canada its like a double.   Overall i think its a great hotel to stay it. Its a place you wouldn't want to brings your kids but it's perfect for the 30-50's age. It's in a somewhat secluded location on lexinghton ave but yoiu here absoultely no traffic!.	
Sep 24 2004	Some Peace 	I recently stayed at The W  The Court and had a very pleasant experience. I asked for and received a corner room on a high floor. Id read that Manhattan hotel rooms are small so I was prepared for the worst. While it was kind of tight between the foot of the bed and the desk, the room was wider, with a small (but comfy) chair and coffee table next to the windows. The walls are all painted white to brighten up the room and theres a giant (6+) mirror that all help to make the room appear bigger. My room overlooked 39th Street, so I had a nice view of the Chrysler Bldg.I was surprised to find a walk-in closet. I was not surprised to find one of the most comfortable hotel beds ever. You really cant beat a bed in a Westin.I can verify that the shower is dark, which is not a big deal. I did have a hard time keeping water from getting all over the floor; theres no lip on the bottom frame of the shower to prevent this from happening. The rain-style showerhead is so much nicer than any of the low flow or cheapo shower massage units found in every other hotel. Lots of pressure and hot water to boot.Bell service and the concierge were quite helpful hailing cabs and getting me to Queens on the train.The hotel is in the dare-I-say sleepy Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan away from the chaos and noise. The neighborhood definitely has more of a residential feel. Still, its only three block walk to Grand Central, which is a boon if youre taking the trains or the NY Airport Service shuttle from the airports to midtown. If youre looking for something closer to the action, The Court might not be your answer. But for me it more than met my expectations and I have no complaints.	
Oct 12 2009 	Fabulous !	Coming from Paris, I was not familiar with the W brand, and what a surprise to land in this chic, classy, hip, stylish (need I say more?) hotel, where the staff is extremely courteous and well trained, the rooms are generous and well appointed, and the ground floor Wet Bar is a hopping place. In addition, the location is superb (in the middle of Midtown, steps away from Grand Central and Empire State Building, to name only two).Compared with other hotels I had originally considered, this hitherto unknown one turned out to be a revelation.I warmly recommend this hotel.	
Sep 3 2005	In the mix	Enjoyed 3 nites at The W where my husband and I found the staff to be extremely accommodating and professional. Kudos to the concierge for some great restaurant recommendations. Centrally located and an easy walk to restaurants, the theatre, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and more. Comfortable room with stylish appointments. Would recommend it highly.	
Apr 22 2004	Funky hotel!	We were moved to this hotel for our first night as our original hotel was over booked. I loved the grey room, the black corridors, the entrance lobby is fab. We stayed on the 33rd floor. I found the staff to be great. Their whatever wherever service is good. We had a problem with our safety deposit box, within minutes the security guys were up taking a look at it and replaced it for us. We were also able to check out before leaving our room over the TV system. I was sad to leave the hotel, great location, a little noisy from street noise but it is Times Square, you can hardly expect it to be quiet!! I would definately stay there again, what a great funky, young hotel!!	
Apr 18 2006	An oasis of peace in NY		
Mar 24 2009 	Another fabulous trip	We stay at the Warwick nyc every time we visit. We traveled this time with our three kids, 20, 18, and 13. I reserved two classic rooms with no view (cheap rate through travelzoo-$179/night) and were upgraded to two wonderful deluxe rooms with views. They have coffee pots that they will bring to you and that was good. The rooms were extremely clean, housekeeping was there every day before noon. We visited the bar every day and sometimes the kids had a burger. The food is pricey but very good! No food in nyc is cheap so you just have to get over it. Had wonderful service. They had a van taxi waiting for us at 5:30 in the morning on a Sunday-great service and of course you tip these fine gentlemen for their efforts.	
Jul 29 2008	Good Value	The Front Desk staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and very large - it even had a walk in closet! The location of the hotel, at the intersection of 6th and 54th, is perfect to get to just about anywhere. It is an easy walk to Times Square or Central Park (for example). The restaurant breakfast is overpriced and you can do better by eating at any of the many nearby restaurants around 7th and 54th. The hotel rates itself as a 4-star hotel, it really is closer to a 3 or 3.5 star hotel. It is an older hotel. The elevators are small, slow and old. If you are on the first 6 floors, you should expect to wait for 2 or 3 elevators to go by before you can squeeze on with your luggage - you may even have to use the service elevators to get down. On the whole, for the price I paid ($219/night via Hotwire) it was definitely worth the money and I would recommend this hotel and stay there again.	
Jul 23 2008 	Great location	We enjoyed our stay at the Warwick Hotel. Nice clean rooms, small but cute. Great location, close to Times Square, short walk to Rockefeller Plaza and close to Central Park!	
May 23 2006	Loved it!	Quaint, affordable, nicely decorated, large, beautiful bathrooms and the windows open. Great restaurant-bar (pricey) and lobby.Overall, a comfortable stay.	
May 13 2005	Absolutely Loved It!	I booked this hotel for a group of 10 people so felt terribly responsible for the choice! I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and after a previous stay in New York, was recommended this hotel by someone I met in a restaurant.We arrived on Saturday, 7th May and returned home on the 12th. We booked direct with the hotel as all the usual British websites could not arrange the booking. This meant that we paid top whack but we weren't disappointed!The five rooms I booked all differed but each one had its own charm with different characteristics. I asked for a coffee maker and it appeared within ten minutes. We had a problem with the toilet blocking one morning but on ringing housekeeping, someone arrived to unblock it within five minutes and five minutes after he left, a cleaner arrived to clean the bathroom floor.As we all drifted into breakfast in the morning - normally two at a time - we were seated in various parts of the breakfast room. If one couple were seated on a table for two and another couple from my party turned up, they offered to move us onto a table for four! We commented that this would never happen in the UK! Once you're sat at a table, they would not allow you and your food to move - thus dirtying another table!All in all, a fabulous hotel in a great location. Staff were friendly, helpful and very polite. We will return to the Warwick when we return to New York! A great choice!!	
Dec 9 2008 	Very nice hotel!	This hotel is an excellent value for the Times Square neighborhood. For 2 people spending 2-3 nights, this hotel is more than sufficient. Yes, the rooms are small....but CLEAN and nicely decorated. The elevator is older but the marble floors, nice lobby furniture and friendly staff make up for the tiny rooms. Our internet wasn't &quot;high speed&quot; every time but hey, it was free.The heat was an issue, but every hotel in Manahattan is stuffy and warm if you ask me. The window opened easily, so we were able to adjust. There's a nice deli on the corner of 8th and 51st, they even remembered how I took my coffee on the 2nd day!Irish bar nextdoor serves good brews from all over and decent food as well. All in all it was a very surprisingly nice &quot;boutique&quot; style hotel.	
Oct 29 2007 	Nice hotel on small side street	The Washington Jefferson was overall a nice hotel.A few of us had rooms that faced the street, those were obviously noisier, but turning on the fan (it was hot) helped drown out the trucks and horse-drawn carriage noise. The rooms are small, but clean and modern, with nice amenities like down comforters, slate bathroom &amp; new fixtures, free wireless, and close to many restaurants and theaters.My room had a full bed, nightstand, desk, and mini-wardrobe. The bathroom was slate tile and had a corner shower with glass enclosure. All very modern &amp; clean, but small. Another colleague had no desk or wardrobe, and another got upgraded to a king room. All depends. Maria Pia across the street was good, and the crepe place was ok, but slow and maybe pick your own crepe filling, some was weird.	
Aug 28 2007	Teeny tiny rooms	Do not stay in room #234 at this hotel... the room faced the street and the window a/c unit allowed all the street noise into the room.the room is half the size of a dorm room...very tiny.On the plus side...the room was very clean. the bathroom was large...very nice shower...good maid service...be careful on hallway staircase.....I tripped every time I climbed those steps.....Would have liked to keep the bathroom window opened for ventilation..but there are residences directly across form the hotel and the shower curtain was clear plastic!!!!very difficult to sleep because of the city noise....If the a/c had been in the room and the window could have been closed that may have helped....Very good location for broadway shows and restaurants.... try Rays pizzaThe Art Cafe on Broadway and 50th is a good breakfast spot....reasonable prices and the meal was served less than 5 minutes after ordering.This hotel is way overpriced for their rooms...	
Jul 3 2006	What a Spot	What a Spot. The location of this hotel is central to everything we like to do; theater, dining ,comedy clubs, the moma, nightlife etc.. By being in such a central location we saved money on cab fares. The hotel is extremely clean with friendly service. Our sleeping quarters were very small consisting of a comfortable queen sized bed, a stand-free wardrobe,desk and ceiling tv. There is little room to move around, but who spends much time inside a NYC hotel? Our bathroom was almost the size of our sleeping area. It was clean and modern. It comes with a hairdyer and ecofriendly bathing products. We stumbled across this hotel thru a pricline booking and ended up paying $110. a night. Expedia prices advertised were $145. a night. This was July 4th weekend.There are several restaurants right outside the door. We had dinner at the french restaurant across the street one night. I wouldn't go back. But I may not be a fair judge because french cuisine isnt my favorite. There is a friendly pub located next door which has every beer on tap that you can imagine with a bangers and mash type of menu.Bottom line- I think we were lucky to have stayed at this place and would consider booking there directly(as opposed to priceline) for our next trip.	
Nov 16 2005	Low price - Small Hotel - Excellent service and location	Clean and nice little hotel in the heart of New York. The hotel has excellent service, and the location is a only few min walks from Time Square, Central Park and St. Patricks. The rooms are small, almost to small - but comfortable and very clean, and who spend times in a hotel room when visiting New York City?	
Jan 8 2008 	Great location mixed stay...	First - the location is great. If you want a more authentic New York experience, Greenwich Village is a must. Great atmosphere, shops, coffee shops (real, not just Starbucks!), and the hotel is bang in the middle of all of these. A subway just around the corner will wizz you up to Times Square, but we couldn't wait to get back again!Having stayed in New York before, there are some things you just can't change... yes the rooms aren't huge, but who needs a huge room when there's so much to see outside! The bigger issue was the size of the bed, which though it said Queen, was not the size I expected, and my feet did go over the end! Yes, it was noisy outside, and we did have to move once to escape the noise from above the bar exit at 2am, and yes the lorries and sirens woke us up, but this is a city, so you get over it!The staff were helpful and generally very friendly, and the breakfasts were great. We did eat in the bar on our first night, and the food and service were very good.Would I go back? I think so, and I would recommend to friends, but for a real authentic experience in a great location, you have to put up with the odd flaw!	
Sep 17 2007 	Excellent Value for Money	We were expecting a small room and we got one. However, it was very functional, had everything we wanted, including a hair dryer, TV, iron and ironing board. The room was very clean, with good quality towels, changed daily and complimentary tolietries.The hotel is in an excellent location with a subway station just 200 yards away and many good bars and restaurants nearby. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, despite what some other reports have stated.One downside was the complimentary breakfast. No matter what time we went for breakfast, we had to queue on the stairs while we waited for someone to come and show us to a table. Then when we finally got a table, the service was slow and somewhat lacking. The one day we decided to order something cooked, at an additional charge, they got the order wrong. After that we decided to eat breakfast outside at one of the many good and inexpensive diners in the area.We visited the hotel bar once, but almost $18 for two beers was a little excessive, so we didn't go there again.At the end of the day, the hotel was excellent value for money, although the bar wasn't and the breakfast problems would not stop us staying there again. Most hotels are room only, so treat this one as such and you can't go far wrong.	
Feb 6 2007	Great Hotel!!!	I stayed for two nights at the end of January 2007 and found this property to be delightful.After reading through most of the reviews here, I followed one travellers advice and when I booked, I requested a Deluxe room several floors up in the Annex. Also, I booked directly through to Hotel website. I have been told that hotels will pay attention to how the reservation was booked and show preference to those who do NOT use a reservation service. Upon checking in, I was guided to my room by a hotel employee and was delighted to find it clean and properly stocked with everything promised. It did take me until the next day to figure out the nightlight in the bathroom, though. The shower was sparkling clean and the water was easily adjusted - hot water plentiful. The water pressure was great and the shower head was terrific. The bed was made up with 4 large pillows (with another in the closet) on 1000 thread-count sheets. There was a safe in the closet (note: customers need to request the key from the front desk if they choose to use it) and plenty of hangers as well as shelves for shoes, bags etc. Breakfast was included in the cost of my stay and consisted of a good sized bowl of fresh fruit, a half of toasted bagel and a small muffin. There were jams and butter for the breads and I was also served a small glass of juice and tea or coffee. In the evening I visited the lounge and was attentively served by the bartender who poured generously.I do have one suggestion to make, which I shared with the staff. I was woken up all three mornings by a room door slamming nearby. I did let the staff know it would be a good idea to try to eliminate this by putting signs on the inside of the room doors that request they be closed quietly between the hours of 11 pm - 9 am. Hopefully they will do it, because I intend to stay at this hotel again.	
Mar 2 2004	Horrible Horrible Hotel		
Jul 4 2009 	No frills perfectly located hotel for a city break.	Hotel is perfectly located for Broadway, Times Square, Central Park and access to all other parts of the city.There is nothing major to complain about, rooms are small, bathrooms very small. All clean and everything in the room worked.Only downside are the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room, however there is a Starbucks right across the street and also a cafe attached to the hotel.On checkout we did hear another hotel guest complain about cockroaches, however we did not experience this at all.	
Mar 11 2009 	Room with a view	We stayed at the Wellington for 3 nights. As its very expensive in New York and we wanted to stay in the middle of things we searched and searched for the cheapest place and came up with this place. It certainly is in a great location, opposite Carnegie Hall and just a few minutes walk from Times Square. We asked for a room on a high floor with a great view and that is what we got, on the 22nd floor with a view of Times Square, which was amazing at night!. The room itself was quite small, with quite a small bed, but that was fine for us as we are small people! It was warm and cosy whish was perfect for the freezing winter nights. The bathroom was basic but had a good shower and was very clean. The hotel is still a 70's style hotel and doesnt really have any modern amenities but when you are in NY you only need a room to sleep in so it was fine for this. There is a cafe which does breakfast lunch and dinner and also a Greek restaurant which has good reviews but we did not go there as with alot of NY it was quite expensive. All in all a great stay and would definately return.	
Dec 11 2008 	wouldn't recommend the welling hotel to my worst enemy!!	Booked this break with 3 other ladies. Booked 2 twin bedded rooms, only to find when we arrived this was not available. Offered 2 rooms with a double bed in each, so were expected to sleep with another person. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. They eventually put a small put-u-up bed in each of the already small rooms. The final insult was un-ironed bed linen. Staff attitude very brusque and rude. Take it or leave it attitude. Would not stay there again, as I might be expected to sleep with a complete stranger!!Susan of Solihull West MidlandsDate of break 25th - 28th October 2008	
Jul 13 2008 	Average Hotel Look elsewhere	We stayed at this hotel after spending three nights at another hotel closer to Macy's. When we arrived at the Wellington Hotel we realized we had made a mistake and should have stayed at our first hotel. Check in took forever with the only bonus being we were upgraded to a bigger bed. We stayed in a part of the hotel which was quite old, and musky. The room was very large but walls were paper thin meaning that you could hear everything that was happening on your floor. The shower pressure was too strong resulting the floor and walls flooding every time you took a shower. The staff were too busy to really help you and the level was service was quite poor. This hotel would be fine if all youre looking for is a bed to sleep in, but otherwise i would look for another hotel which is far nicer which you can book for around the same price.	
Jun 27 2008 	Perfect Location Great Price!	I LOVED this hotel! I had read previous reviews of the Wellington on this website, so I was prepared for the somewhat small size of the room. But the reviews were also right in that when you're in NYC, you're really only using the place to sleep, so it was perfect! When we checked in, we immediately got offered a FREE upgrade, our hotel room was always cleaned, it had a great location, and the staff was very helpful. It's across the street from the famous Carnegie Deli, too! What a great stay! It's also located just a few blocks from Central Park, so when I return to NYC for a family vacation, I am totally going to stay at the Wellington!	
Sep 1 2009 	Luxury made to feel like home!	I went to NY for the first time and since I was alone the staff was wonderful to help me do all the little things like teaching me how to hail a taxi to making reservations at places a solo traveler would feel comfortable. All the staff learned my name on the first day and always went out of their way to welcome me. It was nice to always know who you were going to talk to when a question arose. There was a delay at check-in but it was worth the wait! The room was incredible with views of both the Upper East and West Sides and all of Central Park. I had a Suite that was smaller than most 1-Bedroom Suites in the HGVC resorts but it was plenty big for 1 or 2 people. It had a large couch and a uniquely nice Bose system for a hotel room. The bathroom was the most amazing part since you could take a bath and look out floor to ceiling windows of the city. (As long as your discreet of course!) They have room service that is fast and serves huge portions. One order of bacon lasted me for 3 days. But beware of the mini-bar. I opened it and started picking up several items looking at them but did not take any. At the end of my stay I was charged for all of them and they said that the refrigerator has a weight sensor so when you pick up a item it automatically charges your room. The owners lounge was a nice place to grab a cup of coffee in the middle of the day when I needed a break from the city. However, around cocktail hour it becomes too crowded for my comfort. I'm not sure if you are allowed to go in there if your not an owner though. They had someone outside the door checking off who came in so don't be surprised if you get turned down. I never had breakfast in there so I can't comment on that. The internet worked perfectly and had no complaints overall. It was sort of weird staying at a HGVC resort where you did not have to take out your own garbage and do your dishes. They will come in and empty the trash daily for you upon request only, however like all HGVC resorts they only do cleaning once for a 7 night stay. For me that is to be expected but for others who are checking in here as a hotel instead of timeshare then you need to realize you won't get fresh towels and made beds unless you ask for them. But then again perhaps they treat the hotel guests differently. I don't know. Regardless I loved my week there and did not want to come home.	
Dec 31 2007 	Didn't live up to potential	The price and the room were both good (for Manhattan), but the operation of this hotel frequently disappointed us.Housekeepers didnt come to make up the room until about 4:00. When that happened, our family couldnt go occupy the SMALL common area of the hotel, because it was overflowing with the luggage and bodies of guests waiting to check in.Breakfast was a complete disaster. On 12/24, when breakfast was supposed to go from 6:00 to 9:00, they ran out of OJ and eggs by 8:15, and bagels shortly thereafter. The line for the waffle-maker then got so long that nobody could get to the coffee. Even on a good day, the set-up of the breakfast buffet is an ergonomic nightmare, and needs to be fixed: first milk pitchers, but no cups/glasses; then eggs and bacon; THEN plates; bagels/bread, followed by toasters; next napkins/silverware (not with the plates?), THEN butter/jelly for the bread; fruit; yogurt; cold cereal &amp; bowls (remember where the milk was?). You can get a very inexpensive breakfast on the corner of 35th and 6th Ave., but breakfast is one of the things that made this place a supposed bargain.The hotel has no parking.	
Aug 28 2007 	Ok by Day don't gou out at Night	We travel to NYC about every 4-6 weeks and have stayedin almost all the hotels. We have many of ourbusiness wholesalers there in the city. We likestaying near the Javitz and near Macys as it is walkable to the many things we do and less crowdedthan midtown near Times Square. We heardthe great reviews on Travel Advisor and decided to give this a whirl.Be aware that there is no bell hop at this locationand if you have a lot of baggage there will be no one to help.To catch a cab you also have no bell hop and mustgo down the block to Macys to pick one up, not sogood when hauling all your luggage. Otherwise youcan do what we did have them call a car for youto meet you at the front door. Rooms are smalland clean. Breakfast is nice but very very crowdedthey did not allow enough space.This hotel is located in the garmet district and after 6pm the place becomes dark and full of very interesting characters.Most of which you could do without gatheredin clusters. There is not a security guard onduty at this hotel either. No one outsidemonitoring anything.There is very very little light while walking backto the hotel after dark and allthe business that surrounds the area is closedwith their garage door down and clustersof men that are gathered around.It is only about a block and half from Macys butafter dark it is a long long walk! DId not feel safe at allthere. If you are traveling alone or with another womanI do not recommend staying there if you planon going out after dark. Before dark is fine.For the money The Radisson is in a much betterarea with lots of light and lotsof security and it includes a bell hop and easy access to cabs .	
Apr 19 2008 	Excellent place	I booked from one day to the other because I was running away from a previous hotel in NY, so I booked based on the value and the location, and this was just great.The staff was helpful, the room was very clean and nice. It was a little apartament, with kitchinette, renewed bathroom, big TV, a living room and the bedroom. The price was around USD 150 per night, with the 3rd night for free.The place is three blocks away from the Dakota Building, and the Subway is one block distance. Definitely we´ll be back there.	
Oct 2 2006 	Our room was bugged.	This hotel is not for the faint at heart. My colleagues and I booked three rooms to extend our stay following business meetings in NYC.The neighborhood near this hotel is wonderful but the accomodations are nearly nasty. The lobby and staff are pleasant enough but the journey to your room is dirty and smelly. Our door locks did not lead you to believe you were secure. The rooms are spartan and less than sanitary. Ours came complete with roaches, towels that were not clean and even contained hair balls. If you need your luggage held after check-out they stuff it in a janitor's closet and ask you to leave cash on each piece for an unidentified keeper. It's just creepy.	
Aug 4 2009 	Not Worth the $	I booked a Travelzoo weekly bargain deal. We paid $185 for 1 night (plus breakfast &amp; free cocktails). The room was the smallest room I have ever had at any hotel ever. There was no closet, NO CLOSET. That is how small the room was. The hotel staff was not friendly at check in. The Front Desk did not answer the phone when we called down. The deal we booked was overstated--1 &quot;free cocktail&quot; with the purchase of any other beverage and the items stated on the &quot;free breakfast&quot; were not available. The location of the hotel was ideal for our trip, but I have stayed in many other, larger, more well appointed hotels in the city, and would NEVER recommend this one.	
Dec 31 2008 	Fabulous!	I booked two rooms for our December 2008 stay. One was a king bed for my husband and I and the other had two double beds for my mom and two children The rooms were immaculate. We were able to check in early about 10 am which was terrific! The check in representatives were very helpful and courteous. The concierge was awesome, simply awesome. The hotel has a coffee bar located in the lobby, just steps from the elevator-perfect if you need a great cup of Starbucks. The restaurant is quite nice. Upscale and a bit pricey however the food and the service are worth the price. FYI- it was frigid in the restaurant so bring a sweater. Overall the entire experience was very positive.	
Oct 10 2006 	The Worst Hotel in the US	We stayed in this hotel the past weekend, Oct 6, 2006, on our weekend getaway to SF. I'm not a picky one or could care less about fancy hotels but boy, this was something. When you just enter the hotel, it looks old and has this smell to it but they were remodeling the lobby, so, we didn't care. We had a room on the 5th floor and when we entered, I was shocked. Check out the pictures posted in one of the other reviews. That's exactly how the room looked like - broken cabinet doors, chipped ceiling/walls, no curtains, dirty windows, a dirty bathroom. The worst thing was the bed itself. The sheets were dirty, had &quot;stains&quot; on them and there was cigarette smoke smell everywhere. We went downstairs and asked for a new blanket. The guy brought a new one but didn't take the old one and told us to throw it on the floor. He still didn't offer to change the bed sheets and the pillow covers. It was too late for us to go anywhere else and were forced to spend the night there. I honestly think that it's hazardous to stay here. They must be in violation of some sort of laws. My nose was swollen the next morning. It was so terrible that come next morning, we checked out. I beg everybody to please DO NOT check into this hotel. There are other very affortable hotels around that are CLEAN. For example, just blocks away is Red Coach Lodge - that's where we stayed our second night.	
Jun 4 2009 	Great location accommodation 	We stayed here for 3 nights in May 2009 and found the location fantastic. On reading older reviews, I think they miss the point!!! This is NOT a hotel, they are apartments where people permanently live, and a few are let out for tourists like us. The location is very good, walking distance to the centre of the city and to the Port area as well, the BART and MUNI are only a block or so away as well.The apartments are spacious and well fitted out with a full kitchen for self-catering. The Whole Foods Market is an excellent place for healthy food and has a large hot servery as well where you can buy pre-prepared meals if you don't feel like cooking. Only criticism would be the beds could be a little softer and the pillows a bit better as well. But the service was great, we had a small issue with the television when we arrived, but after a telephone call, it was fixed the next day very promptly.When you compare the cost of staying here to the hotels in SFO, there is no comparison, this is a great value for money place, and having the cooking facilities where you can at least have a bit of a sleep in and have your breakfast when you feel like it is great.I think people are far too critical of accommodation venues in general and don't point out all the positives - and Archstone has plenty of those!! We would definitely stay here again should we be in SFO in the future.	
Sep 2 2009 	Fantastic stay at the Hotel Argonaut!	After weighing up boutique hotels downtown with high parking costs vs staying at the Argonaut. w decided on it for three nights-booked by phone and did the parking, breakfast, cable car ticket package. It was a bit of a splurge for us, but worth every penny! This place was so charming and enjoyable. From the minute we met Steve, the valet, we knew it was going to be a good experience! All the staff seemed really well chosen and went out of their way to help, but Steve really made it special! Our room was lovely! We loved the nautical theme and attention to detail - alot of thought has gone into the restoration of this old cannery building and the decorating. So clean and well maintained! Starbucks coffee and Aveda toiletries and a well stocked mini bar (right down to telescopes for the kids!) with prices we thought weren't too bad at all. We were lucky to have a window with a view to the lovely colors and liveliness of the courtyard and even had a bit of a city view with the Transamerica building right there. Yes, there was music playing throughout the day, but if you shut your windows you heard nothing. We did have a noisy baby crying for awhile the first night and it was pretty loud, but it stopped, which was the important thing! Not too keen on the large dogs trotting about with their owners, we must say, and I do suffer from allergies, but we had asked for a non pet room and I was fine.  The breakfast was excellent....one entree, juice coffee came with our package. We also dined in the restaurant and had a few drinks one evening....all good. I must say though that if they opened the room up without that double row of tables in the middle it would be better. If you end up on the non-bar side, it lacks ambience. Super location. Helpful staff - they had stamps to sell and mailed the postcards for me. A tip from the concierge to get over the the City Wide Tours around the corner for around ten-ish enabled us to score some Alcatraz tickets (with the purchase of their tours of course) - which was great, as they were sold out for the next few days.It was for a late run out to the island which limited your time there, but it worked. The tours with these open double decker buses were great. We did the City tour, the park tour and the run to Sausalito and then we took the ferry back. The wine hour they lay on daily was very generous and we had fun getting to know other guests. Yes, there were lots of families and kids and we were a couple, but there were others like us too and everyone was very happy to be there, you could tell.We would highly recomment the Hotel Argonaut!	
Jul 23 2009 	Excellent Hotel in every respect	Stayed here for a week in July ,and can honestly say this is one of the top hotels that we have stayed in.Everyone that works here is eager to help whenever they can.From the Bell hops on the front door, to the maids for the room cleaning and all those in between,everybody did an exceptional job.Wine tasting in the evenings was a lovely touch and the concierge was always at hand to help book tours and assist with travel arrangements.Pay the extra and go for a room overlooking the Cannery or the Piers/beach.You will not fault this hotel.	
Jun 7 2009 	Comfy hotel	The rooms were very nice in the hotel - clean, good facilities, spacious etc. Sometimes a little noisey - I dont think the walls were particularly thick!We didn't try the restaurant but it always looked full and popular.The wine tasting evenings wasn't as good as we expected - you would have though whilst in California they would have given US wines but no, we had a choice of a tasteless Italian white or red.Staff were friendly and helpful.Location was a little too far along Fisherman's Wharf, it took quite a while to walk into the city but if you're not afraid of a little walk it's not too bad.	
May 19 2009 	What a treat	Stayed for four nights @ 250.00/night rate. Wonderful staff, wonderful location. Clean, cute room. Staff and management friendly, smart and helpful. Adjoining restaurant, Blue Mermaid good. Pet friendly. Free wine (and good wine) 5-7 pm week nights.Highly recommend this hotel.	
Feb 4 2009 	So Excited!	I made a reservation at this hotel for March and have had to call back on three separate occasions. Every time I have called, the representative has exceeded any expectations that I have had for this property. They figured out ways to save me money ( I used the saving to get a better view!), listed great things to do with the kids, and offered special accommodations for them (goldfish in the room.. so cute!) We have a big vacation planned coming up, and this is only one of our stops, but I can definitely say that I am most excited for this stay! It is the kids' first time in SanFrancisco and I am sure that this hotel will compliment our stay perfectly. We normally don't participate in the hotel's activities, such as the evening reception, but we have specifically set up nap time around the events, since the agent assured me that the kids are more than welcome to attend!The reason why I am posting this so early is because I know how difficult it is to find decent customer service from a hotel. I am a travel agent and have to work with them all day. I have already recommended this hotel to a number of my clients just for the simple fact that if I need to talk to them, I will be speaking with someone who is kind, professional, and efficient.I am just so excited for my stay, I will write more when we get back!	
Apr 9 2009 	For party weekends only	This place is located right next to Chinatown &quot;entrance gate&quot; and short walk to everything you'll need, including nightlife and public transport. The room had everything we needed, i.e. bathroom, safe, two beds, and windows. However, the room was disgusting: the walls, the windows, the bathroom, the carpet, the fan heater, basically everything really really old and worn, but not dirty. However, value for price is okay, since it was essentially the cheapest place around. I was there with two friends and the only time we spent in the room was for sleeping (after having significant amounts of beer and/or cocktails). If you intend to stay sober and spend some time awake in your room, you should seriously consider some other place. If you have your girlfriend or family with you, definitely stay away. This place is for party weekends only.	
Mar 17 2005	Excellent location has a certain 'charm'	I stayed at Beck's in 2004. The location can't be beat, in the heart of the gay district, with lots of bars, restaurants and shops. There is a lot within walking distance. Free parking on site is a great bonus. The staff is friendly. The rooms are adequate but clean. There is a lot of cruising on the premises, but the guys are not aggressive (unless you want them to be)! The rooms can be very warm, so if you leave your window or door open, it can be interpreted that you are looking for company.	
Aug 22 2007 	Customer Service wins at BA Hotel - Long-winded	Left my wallet at the Burbank Airport Terminal on my way to San Fran for a weekend getaway.. I returned to the airport on a Monday only to learn that SW had fedex'd it [not overnight like i had requested]My wallet conveniently arrived at the BA Hotel that Tuesday and they called to notify. Fedex advised that I couldn't schedule a pickup without an account so I asked Bob if he could take the wallet , repackage and send to me. Bob agreed without hesitation however it would have to wait until the other person came in to relieve him.I got a call back from David, who confirmed that he sent the package. He said that he couldn't pay with my CC so he used the company card and they would charge me through the hotel system. Furthermore, two maintenance issues that came up during our stay [one issue we notified the hotel of, the other was fixed before we said anything] were taken care of promptly.For a bargain hotel in the middle of downtown that is still pricey for what it is [what hotel isn't in that vicinity], their handling of customer service is superb. They do not let their slightly outdated hotel serve as an excuse to provide outdated customer service. I travel frequently for work and, by nature, have frequent bizarre mishaps that require extra service from hotels - I was pleasantly surprised that the BA Hotel matched the service many other chain hotels. They still provide a nice afternoon social hour and complimentry pastries/coffees for breakfast if you're on the run, on a budget, or insist on getting your money's worth. There is a great breakfast/lunch place one block east at Taylor, The Crepe House.	
Jun 9 2007 	Never stayed..But they like to charge you anyway!	Booked this hotel back in February for a May visit. They gave us a confirmation number. Called and cancelled on 3/13 and asked for a cancellation number..They said they don't use them, but assured me that it would be cancelled. This month, the charge appeared on my MasterCard! Nice, huh	
Dec 27 2006 	Very pleased!	My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in September along with my parents. We are in our mid 40's and my parents are in their mid 60's. We were VERY pleasantly surprised with this hotel. We didn't request rooms together but they very considerately had already assigned them to us. Our rooms were clean and well appointed. The room my husband and I stayed in had a walk in closet, a kitchenette and a large deep tub. We got our rooms for $99.00 a night! The rooms weren't air conditioned and it was a little warm for us since we had such beautiful September weather. They did provide fans though so it was fine at night. We are both very hot natured and had been concerned about that - but it really wasn't much of a problem and from what I've heard about typical San Francisco weather it is probably unusual to be hot at all. There was a free continental breakfast and coffee in the mornings and a computer available for free in the lobby. The staff was friendly and helpful in giving us directions and the location was great. We didn't have a car so we either walked or took a cab everywhere we went. The only problem I had was the walking directions from the BART station where very hard for me to figure out. Plus - with luggage that's a pretty long walk up a few steep hills. I would recommend grabbing a cab if you're coming from BART - I think it was less then $10 with the tip - and well worth it!	
Jun 1 2009 	Great Location very clean hype decoration!	We stayed one night in SF and in this hotel and it was great. The staff young and very friendly, the location is great, off Market street, a 5 minute walk from Union Square. We were very possitively surprised by the cleanliness and decoration of the rooms. We were in Las Vegas before and stayed at the Planet Hollywood which is considered a 4 star hotel and &quot;resort&quot; and the cleanliness of the Best Western Americania is not even compared. Our rooms were decorated in a very youthfull and hype way. If we go to SF again, we will definitely return to the Americania!	
Sep 27 2009 	Decent value fun decor	We stayed here our last night in San Francisco. We liked the location in Japantown, which had many restaurants and fun shops to explore. Bus service was convenient. We're not into the club/nightlife scene, so the location was great for us - our night there was quiet, though we did get a room 2 doors down from the squeaky elevator. We got a good prepaid rate from another website which was a factor for choosing this over other area hotels. The carpet in the room had some wear, but otherwise the room was clean and comfortable. The J-pop/anime/etc. touches were fun.	
May 24 2007 	j-pop gem in lower pacific heights/ japantown.		
Jun 3 2009 	nettes Hotel in SF		
Mar 15 2009 	Good Location but what's with the Check in / out staff?	Was a nice, clean and quiet room. A little cramped, especially around the sink area.Excellent location, close to the wharf and cable car lines. Complementary coffee in the morning however, they have stopped with the biscotti!In addition, they advertise Limousine service to the financial district but when I inquired they announce they had stopped the service and I would need to take mass transportation. So I figured times must be hard.As I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment. That set me off since I did try to do that. So I had problems with the check in and check out staff .On the other hand, the valet parking attendant/bell people were very friendly.Do not know if I will stay there again, due to the problems with the staff at the check in/out counter.	
Jan 28 2007 	Good Place if you can get a Discount	We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal -$99 for a room with king-size bed and free parking (which usually goes for at least $30 in this part of town). The room was nicely decorated - nothing too fancy. Staff were very friendly and courteous. And, we appreciated the complementary touches - wine/cheese in the evening and coffee/tea and biscotti in the morning. Location is very convenient to Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach, Russian Hill, and the Embarcadero. Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking.	
Nov 2 2007 	Love this place!	Wasn't expecting this to be good as it was cheap for San Fran, but it's a little gem! Short walk to bus stop that takes to you everywhere. Just around the corner from some fab reastaurants and little bars, so no need to go into town.Felt very safe round here.Hotel is basic, but big, quiet, clean rooms. Some are smoking rooms, but couldn't smell stale smoke. Big bonus - 15 minutes free internet access in the hotel lobby! Reception staff very helpful - its all good!	
Jun 24 2009 	Basic 	Location was central and convenient. The neighborhood felt safe at night. The area has many restaurants, a good bookstore, laundromat, drugstore, and natural foods store within walking distance. Parking is tight - be patient if your vehicle is large. The complimentary breakfast is very basic and is available in the front desk area on a small counter - no dining area here. It's enough to get you going for an hour or two. I was surprised how quiet our room was considering the heavy traffic on the streets - we were on the third floor about halfway back. If your trip involves busy days away from your room - this place works as a clean, quiet place to sleep and relax.. If you want a plush room and expect to spend much time in your room, I'd look elsewhere.	
Apr 28 2007	Good place for the value	The Castle Inn is a good place in a great location for the value. Visited there with my Mother recently and enjoyed our stay. Varsa at the front desk rules!! Very helpful, very nice. I do think the hotel needs some upgrading. There was porcelain chipped out of the tub, the caulk needed redone, the soap dish was rusty, and a fresh coat of paint would be nice. -- Little things that would not deter me from staying there again. The cleaning service was not too great. They left bedding in our room one day - not sure if it came from out bed or someone elses and the breakfast tray with morning leftovers tray wasn't removed one day. Overall, this hotel was still a great value for the location.	
Dec 27 2005	If your going to San Francisco ...	... don´t forget to book the Castle Inn. We just came back from a two week vacation in SFO. After research we chose the CI. And we were pleased with our decisicion the whole time. The booking via e-mail was very friendly and even changing the reservation a few weeks later was handled in a very kind way. At Check-in we first met Versa. She is -as all of the reviews before told- a real asset. So friendly and helpful. Thank you Versa! The owners Marshall and his wife do a great job here. Once i couldn´t find a parking space in the middle of the night and Marshall came out of his bureau at once and offered me to park my car in the registration lane - at 1 a.m.!The room itself was spacious, had even view to the top of Golden Gate Brigde and was very, very clean. The plus in this hotel are several features, you never get in a chain hotel (in this price category): glass shower doors, massaging showerheads, very good (and probably new) matresses, frigde + microwave, free parking, FREE WLAN connection in your room and much more.i can´t say that i ever stayed in a city hotel near this price range and have been that much satisfied. we will always choose the CI again while staing in SFO!	
Nov 9 2005	Cheap construction - get a top floor room	Great Managers - Lousy room - Cheap construction - Could hear the upstairs neighbor every time they got out of bed - creak , creak , creak.	
Apr 21 2005	A great place to stay!	We spent three nights very comfortable nights at the Castle Inn at the beginning of April and would definitely recommend it as an excellent place to stay in San Francisco. The people at the front desk were very friendly and were happy to give advice about places to go and good restaurants in the area. We thought the location was very convenient - 10/15 minutes walk to Fisherman's Walf and near to bus and cable car stops (both of which were an excellent way of getting around, particularly if you buy a travel pass).	
Mar 30 2005	Great place great location	We stayed here 4 night all together, and will definitely stay there again if/when we return to San Francisco. We dealt with several different members of staff, and they were all extremely helpful. The rooms are large and very clean. The location is excellent, only a 15 minute walk from e.g. Chinatown, and in a safe, nice area with loads of eateries (those recommended by the staff were excellent).	
Apr 2 2004	If you are on the budget this is great!		
Sep 24 2009 	Average works if you're out of the room most of the day.	Don't accept a room on levels 1-4 that face the interior of the building. There's no airflow and our room was very warm... very uncomfortable. The people at the front desk were pleasant, except for one woman who was very short with me when I complained about the room. The next night, we were moved to a suite that had a bed, couch and 2 bathrooms. It was completely unnecessary, and the room with the bed and bathrooms were actually smaller than our previous room. I wasn't impressed by the gesture of the suite in some way it felt insulting. Other than that the room was clean and nice. I was disappointed with area we stayed because the restaurant selection by our hotel was limited, and there didn't seem to be much to do.	
Jun 29 2007 	great privately owned local motel	the is a terrific place-especially for the value. the location is perfect. the staff was fantastic &amp; eager to please. doug, the manager,was delightful. the owners care about their properties &amp; it shows. ask for the back side-or quiet side. bed &amp; pillows were comfy, great plush towels,amenities. lots of great restaurants in walking distance.plus owners refuse to raise rates for special events. how often to you find that??!!! will definitely go back.	
May 31 2004	Not a 3-star property		
Mar 28 2008 	Perfect location great deal	My family of four (two children, ages 8 and 5) stayed in a two-room unit for 6 nights. The location is PERFECT. We took the #30 bus to almost everything, and the cable car stop is close too. We ate breakfast at Pat's Cafe right around the corner. We were on the first floor facing a courtyard and did not hear any noise at all. Location was safe and quiet, and parking was free. The amenities were basic as far as linens and other room features, but adequate and clean. Our favorite dinner was at Macaroni Sciuè Sciuè - take the #30 bus to get there! I can not think of any reason to pay triple price somewhere else.	
Jun 22 2005	Highly Recommed	I was going to say how great this place was, but the other post here said exactly what I was going to say. They left out that the less crowded Cable Car line is only 3 blocks from the hotel. Real nice &amp; quite area also, the best that I've stayed in here. Do plan to return!	
Feb 12 2008 	Great Location!	This was my first trip to San Francisco - and I wanted a hotel near enough to major attractions, within easy reach of public transportation, but not in the heart of a highly touristy area. Comfort Inn By the Bay was perfect! Located at the corner of Van Ness and Lombard Streets, it's on the bus line, walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and only 3 blocks from the Powell-Hyde Cable Car line (uphill all the way, but definitely worth it). The cable car stop at Powell and Lombard is at the top of the &quot;World's Crookedest street&quot; - a must see! If the climb up doesn't take your breath away, the view at the top will. Like all Comfort Inns, there's a free breakfast buffet with make-your-own waffles, cereal, danish, toast, muffins, fresh fruit, juice, coffee &amp; tea. Not a huge selection, but enough to get you started. The selection doesn't change, so it could get boring if you were there for more than a couple of days running. Staff was friendly, helpful and came up with a great local restaurant suggestion for Thai food within walking distance. We would definitely stay here again.	
Aug 29 2005	Great Bay Views	We stayed at the Comfort Inn By The Bay on August 25th &amp; 26th. We booked through Expedia and got our rooms for around $150/night (which includes tax). We paid for a panoramic view of the bay &amp; we were not disappointed. We were in room 811 &amp; had a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge as well as the neighborhoods surrounding the hotel by the Wharf. As another poster said, if you're looking for luxury accomodations this is not the place, however if you're looking for a clean, comfortable/affordable hotel with a great view then give this place a try. We had 2 double beds in our room. The bathroom has 2 areas. 1 room (which is very small) for the tub and toilet &amp; then an open area with your sink, mirror &amp; hair dryer. We didn't mind the small bathroom since we were not in our room a great deal. The location was great. We loved being able to walk to the Wharf, Union Street Shops &amp; other places in a fair amount of time. We ate at the Cafe Lombard right across the street for dinner one night &amp; the food was fabulous &amp; affordable. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. They also let us store our luggage since we had an 11:30 flight that night, which was nice.	
Sep 9 2009 	I love this hotel - service is spot on	I have stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown San Francisco. This is my 6th time at this hotel over the past two years.The rooms are always clean and comfortable and there is free high speed internet. If you didn't bring your computer they offer free computers in the lobby.They offere a small indoor pool and great hot tub that is in doors as well.It's nice having a starbucks in the lobby.Ask for a room tier 22 on a high floor for a great view of the bay bridge	
Aug 1 2007 	Quiet relaxing and friendly	Stayed at the hotel for a long business/pleasure weekend and was very impressed. The property is very clean and upscale, while the staff is friendly and accommodating. Room service was the fastest I've ever experienced at a hotel and offered a nice selection for breakfast and dinner.Room wise, the plasma TV was great and the mini-fridge (as opposed to a stocked mini-bar) is fantastic...allows you to keep what you want (there's a nice liquor store right across the street from the entrance for stocking it).The one thing I did notice was that the mattresses are not very firm. Not a problem for me personally, but it wasn't to my partner's liking.Yes, parking is expensive, but it's SF. Every time I called for my car, it was there in less than 5 minutes, so that was great.Overall, it was a great place to stay, just a short (about 10-minute) walk from Market Street and Union Square.	
Jul 19 2008 	Nice HotelNot so nice neighbourhood	I was here for my convention along with my colleague.The Rooms and shower were pretty good. The staff at the hotel, Mohi especially was very helpful. The breakfast was very nice, with a lot of choice, so you can go out in the morning with a full belly. For eating, Subway and TacoBell KFC , were just around the corner.The only problem was that the TV and internet services they offered were not so good, they were just about OK. Overall enjoyed the stay, got my job done, what i was there for.	
Jul 1 2009 	Gute Lage		
Feb 1 2008 	Will return to Cow Hollow.	The room was very clean and comfortable. Hanging above the desk was a beautiful chandelier which gave the room a very nice touch. We had a room in the back of the building so there was absolutely no street noise. The bathroom was very clean and the in-room coffee was good. Staff was friendly. There are many small restaurants, coffee shops and a Walgreens around the corner. Very convenient! Will come back.	
Aug 12 2003	Not perfect but still 5 stars	I really liked it here and 89 dollars seemed a reasonable price to pay. The much commented on 'wine tasting' was actually more of a 'wine drinking' with plenty of people indulging in a couple of glasses. The wine is only ordinary but still nice; the white was well chilled (BA Lounges take note). It worked really well as a place to meet other tourists and compare notes.Our room was small but we weren't spending a lot of time in there. I see what other advisors mean about shabby. The hotel is definitely fraying around the edges. The shower, while reasonably powerful, was not in great order. Some of the rooms are noisy but I can't believe this is unique in a small city centre hotel.They have broadband internet access in the lobby which was convenient and not too expensive. Staff were pretty good I thought - Vincent especially was very helpful in helping us work out how our hire car worked! And Tara got us Alcatraz tickets. There was a relaxed vibe about the staff which I imagine does not go down too well if something is wrong.Location can't really be beaten. Handy for just about everywhere or, at least, transport to everywhere.They have been taken over by Executive Hotels now, let's hope they arrest the slide down the tripadvisor popularity poll!	
Feb 19 2006	The place to stay in San Francisco	My partner and I stayed at the Four Seasons San Francisco for our 15th Anniversary - January 26-29, 2006. I spent many hours trying to figure out where to stay for our special trip and I am so glad I chose the FSSF. Many past reviews made the location sound remote and unsafe. I could not disagree more. The hotel was centrally located near Union Square with fine shopping and dining all around. The cable car was nearby as well. The hotel itself is quite plain on the exterior but very beautiful and modern inside. The lobby and all public areas are beautiful and immaculately clean as you would expect. The Seasons Restaurant and bar were both fabulous, overlooking Market Street. We had drinks several times in the bar and breakfast each morning in the restuarant. The Fitness Center was very nice but also crowded with traffic external to the hotel. As for the room, the bathroom was very nice with marble and L'Occitane products. The room was a nice size complete with Signature FS luxury bedding and a Sony CD/Stereo system - bring your favorite CD's. While the room was beautiful and luxurious it was rather stark. The colors were all muted - lacked warmth. I would recommend a room on the Market Street side of the hotel - the other side is considered 'Bay View' but to me looks more like a ship yard. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The service throughout the hotel was the Classic FS Intuitive that they advertise which in the end is what distinguishes them. The hotel sent a very nice amenity upon our arrival wishing us 'Happy 15th Anniversary'. Every time we leave a FS hotel we feel that we were cared for during our stay rather than just served. The service is very good but never sappy or patronizing - always Intuitive. We will stay at the FSSF again next time we visit San Francisco.	
Feb 12 2008	Loved the Francisco Bay	Staying at the Francisco Bay was a wonderful experience. Bob and the rest of the staff gave me a warm welcome and made me feel at home. They staff did everthing possible to make me enjoy my visit to San Francisco. I will always remember my trip with fond memories and I look forward to staying at the Francisco Bay INN when I go back to CaliforniaMarvin B	
Aug 11 2006 	Didn't sleep! Very Noisy.	Overall, the room was clean, bed was only ok and the cable had only limited channels. However, I will never choose this hotel again. I arrived mid-day after traveling all morning and was snottily told I could check in, but a room was not available until after 3 p.m. Ok, not a problem, I asked for the restroom so I could freshen up. I was given a restroom key to a facility in the basement by the clerk with a very snotty - cannot be bothered attitude. Upon my evening return, I was assigned my room (thankfully Snotty's shift was over) and realized the air conditioner was not working. I requested a change to which I promptly greeted with new keys and directed to my new room. Which to my suprise was out the side door into the stairwell - there was my room. Kinda creepy, but ok there is air conditioning. There was also street noise so I tried to get some sleep after putting in ear plugs. At midnight a car alarm started going off and it was down hill from there. I called the front desk many times and NEVER got an answer. I then became frightened as I heard people in the stairwell. I never went back to sleep! I was able to move to a new room the next day which was just ok.	
Apr 30 2005 	Quaint friendly 	A fantastic location, 10 mins walk from all the shops &amp; resturants on Union Square! Rooms are small but clean. Disappointing room service, however amazing choice of food next door at the Gallaria Park centre. Staff extremely friendly &amp; complementary wireless high speed internet access in all rooms too! Great business location.	
Nov 7 2006 	Good value for a park 	I booked this hotel through a park &amp; fly site and was very pleased with the experience. The room was &quot;no frills&quot; but clean and comfortable. The breakfast was not fancy but got us throught the morning and the shuttle was prompt, coming and going. The over all price was comparable to what I would have paid for long term parking. I would rate it an excellent value for the rate charged and will stay here again on our next trip.	
Feb 29 2008 	Vacation	We stay at many Hyatt Hotels. We felt their guest rooms need renovations. Lobby seems outdated and need for a soft renovations to update decor. Staff was very friendly and the concierce desk was very helpful.	
Jun 25 2005	Amazing View and Terrific Staff	We stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco after leaving an unacceptable &quot;landmark&quot; Union Square hotel one night into our trip. The Grand Hyatt desk staff was incredibly accomodating to find a room for the balance of our vacation. We stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the city and the bay. The bellman told us the room was very recently updated. The linens and pillow-top mattress were very nice! Everything was very clean and the view was just incredible. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful: doorman, front desk, bell services and concierge. The location of this hotel is very convenient to Union Square, China Town, shopping and theaters. As with any of the hotels in this area, you should request an upper level room, at a slight cost premium, if you want a better view and less street noise.	
Oct 21 2008 	This hotel was a dump!!!!	We stayed in room 508 and it was so small you could hardly move around the bed. There was what looked to be mold on the ceiling and wall above the television set. The bathroom was tiny and the shower door would not close so water leaked out. There was more of what appeared to be mold under the bathroom window. I actually saw bugs crawling on the wall next to the sink. We tried to get another hotel but all that we called were booked. I have pictures of the room and everything we described. The room was dirty and literally made me sick!!! The road noise from the street below was awful, but you had to leave the window open for the terrible odor. We spoke with other guest who actually said the same thing. I will never stay at this hotel again, I think the taxi cabs on the street would be a better choice.	
Oct 2 2008 	Great location great deal	Fantastic location, clean and totally adequat considering the small price we paid.	
Jan 10 2006 	Bad service	I had to change 3 rooms before I could stay there. First room had open electrical wires. The lamps shut off and on when I moved the drawer. The second room was filled with chlorine. Actually, all 3rd floor has this smell. Not recommend	
Nov 1 2004 	A solid deal	Considering location and the fact that each room has a bathroom, the Grant Plaza is a solid deal-- I paid about $55/night. My room was clean. If noise doesn't bother you, make sure to request a room facing the street. Otherwise you will find yourself in a dark, dungeonlike room facing an indoor fire escape that you cannot get to without throwing a chair through your window. I found the staff to be kind and helpful. My fifth floor corner room had a great view of the downtown area.	
Sep 13 2004	Don't let the bedbugs bite!	I stayed here 9/11/04. Location of the hotel is excellent for shopping Union Square, eating in North Beach, buying trinkets in Chinatown, getting mugged in the Tenderloin etc. And the price $69 p.n. is unbeatable for San Francisco. Look for a room on the top floors and you are not as cramped as other people experiences here. However the room is still small, twin single beds, shower head I had to duck under (I'm 5'8&quot;). TV reception was poor but I wasn't here to watch TV. E-mail/internet available but no printer. No laundry service. Parking is a block away in Stockton-Sutter which I paid $23 total for 4 days /3 nights (I didn't ask for a recheck! it is usaually $17 a day).A rough and ready hotel, suitable for a lads weekend, don't bring your girlfriend here unless you intend hearing all about how she hated the hotel for the next few years. And I got to bring back some nice souvenirs from the hotel. A mass of bed-bug bites.	
May 5 2003	Best Bargin in S.F.		
Nov 10 2006	Great Place	We stayed in Greenwich for 4 days on 2nd floor room. It has beautiful skylight in the bathroom, It has coffee maker and the beds are really comfortable. Bob, manager is really a great person he was so helpful and always smiling. Mels drive in is around the corner, Ihop is open 24 hrs around the corner. It is close to more than 40 great shops and restaurants.. when I say 40 I mean it ! The best part is - its not on lombard st, people often complaint about the noise of it being on highway 101. It is one block away from lombard may be 25 feet away. Worth a stay !!! when you are in good place with good people - it is always a feel good factor and it's a trip you always remember.	
Oct 5 2006 	Perfect for Large Family	After much research, selected this for our family with 4 kids. It was ideal, with a separate bedroom with 2 beds and a pull out sofa. Suite was luxurious, with nice kitchen and spectacular views. Location was excellent, with easy walk to Chinatown and the wharfs, then cable car right to front door. Staff was always helpful and friendly. Price was very reasonable for location, although the parking fees hurt. Would definitely stay here again.	
May 8 2005	The website is lovely... can't say the same for the hotel.	The best thing I can say about this hotel is that they have a lovely website -------. And admittedly, everything on the website is technically true. For example, they do have personal safes in every room. However, as the owner will eagerly inform you, they don't actually have keys for them. The bathroom did have an &quot;antique, claw-foot tub.&quot; You could tell it was antique because all of the paint was chipping off. The front door is indeed secure with a coded entry pad, but you'll probably have to make a separate trip down to the owner's office in the basement to get the entry code, since he'll forget to tell you. Check-in time is, in fact, three pm, and they even let us check in a few minutes early. However, we couldn't actually get into our room until three thirty, because it hadn't been cleaned yet. Oh, and don't assume that the reservations you made will correspond with what you actually get. They somehow overbooked the first night we were there and reserved us a room at the Beresford Arms around the corner (an infinitely nicer place) instead. They notified us of this by taping an envelope to the front door with my name spelled incorrectly on it. The website claims it has &quot;room service,&quot; but as nearly as we could tell, it consisted of handing us a photocopy of addresses of local restaurants and liquor stores. The basket of &quot;breakfast beverages&quot; was just generic ground coffee. It wasn't all bad, honestly - there were clean plates, cups, and silverware, a toaster and a microwave, and all that. And the bathtub is big enough for two people, which is nice. Just... don't expect too much.	
Aug 9 2009 	Good hotel but some road noise at front	This is a good hotel in an excellent location. However there was a lot of noise from the street - including delivery noise in the night. Having said that when we asked if we could change rooms we were given a quiet room in a different part of the hotel.	
Oct 23 2008	Great Family Hotel	Our family of 5 really loved this hotel.We booked a family room that turned out to be very spacious and had 2 single beds,a double bed and a Queen sofa in 2 separate rooms.The location itself cannot be beat,close to Union Square,with great shopping and restaurants and the Cable Car basically at your door.John the Concierge is very helpful with directions and tips and although parking is a bit pricey,although typical for San Francisco,it is very convenient.We loved our stay in San Francisco made better by choosing to stay at The Handlery Union Square.	
Mar 2 2008	Nice place great location	As said in other reviews, this place is in a great location. Just one block off Union Square. I was there with a conference but used to live in San Francisco, so I had mixed feelings. The other meeting participants LOVED the location and enjoyed the shoping and all the rest there is to do there. However, in a few blocks, you are really in the heart of the tenderloin, so it's necessary to be a little cautious and be aware of your surroundings. The hotel itself was nice. I stayed in the &quot;club&quot; rooms. A bit priceier but much bigger than the other rooms. A few other people in the group did not stay in this suite of rooms and complained about the small rooms. I haven't stayed in Union Square before, so I thought this was a nice place with a good meeting room.	
Jun 4 2007 	KUDOS!!!	I really enjoyed staying at the Handlery. I got an excellent price compared to other hotel rates in the union square area. The rooms were modern and average size. I found the beds to be very comfortable. Nice and cushy. Those who prefer hard beds may not like them, but I was in heaven. Staff was very accomodating and helpful. I was greeted every morning along with a smile. They also had a pool which was a pretty decent size. The pool is a great ammenity since not too many hotels in the area offer one.I would highly reccomend the handlery!	
Jan 17 2007 	Good location but old and smelly	Stayed here for 2 nights between Christmas and New Year. The hotel is in a great location ,but we had requested non-smoking and were given a smoking room. Had to be moved. No view and dark room (stained carpet) with an odd smell about the entire hotel, I guess this is because it is old. Room size okay but bathroom small. Staff not overly helpful. Uncomfortable pillows but quite clean. The hotel Grill and bar was quite good. Would look for somewhere else next time.	
Oct 4 2006 	Not Great and very noisy	Stayed 23 to 25 Sept inclusive.Arrived 10am - Check in fairly quick. Bags stored until room ready after 3.30pm.Room on 7th Floor - Very noisy due to street noise (OK it is in a busy shopping district) A/C was noisier than street noise and essential if you were to breath as bedroom window was sealed and temps were in the 70's. A/c was too noisy!.Hotel is central so good for shopping and close to the Powell/Mason Cable car. Tip go the stand at Powell at busy times for a reasonable chance to get on. Breakfast at Lefty O'Douls four doors down from hotel is better value than Daily Grille.Go to Powell and take the F street car to Fishermans Wharf, very scenic and a lot less crowded than Cable Cars. Lots of panhandlers on the streets.Choose another hotel if you can this one is not great value.	
Apr 1 2006	We enjoyed our long weekend at the Handlery ...	My husband and I stayed here last weekend for 3 days. We have both been to SF many times, and wanted a moderately priced hotel in a good location. I think the Handlery was a perfect choice!Like all the other reviewers mentioned... Location is KEY. Right smack in the middle of union square. It was very convienent to everything; lots of shopping and restaraunts in walking distance. It's definitely a bustling area.When I first saw the candid reviewers photos on here it made me nervous. But our room was one of the newer club rooms. I took several pictures to show everyone that the new club rooms are much nicer and cleaner. Much more modern than some of the other pictures show. So when you book try to ask for a Club Room. Also our room was located thru a different area of the hotel where you had to walk thru a hallway and go up some stairs, then you walk pass the pool area and to an elevator which takes you up to your room. It is not as far as it sounds, but something to consider if you have alot of luggage. Use a bellhop :-)One weird thing about the room was there was no art on any of the walls? Very simple and classic. The room was average size, the bed faced the window/balcony which is a little unusual. But at night you can see the city lights so that was kind of nice too.They do provide a fridge in room which was great, we filled it with bottled water and sodas for the duration of our trip. The balcony was small (but plenty of room for 2 adults) but my husband would go get coffee and a newspaper ever morning and bring it back to the room, sit outside and enjoy!We used the Wi-Fi internet ($10 day). They had an automatic shoe polisher that my husband tried to use but they did not provide any shoe polish in the room. Maybe you have to call downstairs and ask for that? They have a vanity area which is nice for the ladies to get ready in the mornings or before going out.My only complaint would be when the heater/air came on the noise was LOUD. I am not sure if it's because its an older building? Usually we would just run the air or heat until we were happy with the temperature and just shut it off. If you are a light sleeper, I think you may have some problems.I would give the Handlery 5 stars for location, and 3.5 stars for our overall experience.	
Dec 5 2005	Take the Good with the Bad......	My husband and I just got back yesterday from spending 4 nights at the Handlery Hotel. I had read the TripAdvisor reviews before booking through my travel agent, and we hummed and hawed about staying at one of the pricier hotels, (since my husband is all about the 5 stars), but I finally convinced him to try this one since I knew we knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room, and the extra $$ would be better spent on nice dinner's and shopping. First of all, if you are going to stay there, pay the extra (which isn't that much) and stay in a Club Section Room. Ask for the quiet section overlooking the pool. Our room was 767, and quite frankly we were very comfortable in it. Don't book a room at the Handlery if you want a Luxury Hotel. It is not like that, so if you're going with comfort and functionality in mind, you will not be disappointed. The bed was comfortable and the in-room amenities were useful (bathrobes, fridge, and vanity area). Overall the staff were helpful, although one person in particular, Shirley, went above and beyond to provide great service to us. The location is amazing, and you are a stone's throw from the cable cars, restaurants, and amazing shopping. The Daily Grill has a great lunch menu and Lefty's was our favourite for breakfast, and if your nice to any one of the Handlery staff they will give you tickets for juice with breakfast. The dinner possibiliites are endless around that area, but try to make reservations earlier in the day, or the day before you want to go.If we were to visit San Francisco again, we would probably stay somewhere else, but only because we like to try different things, not because the Handlery wasn't a good hotel.P.S. If you are going to visit Alcatraz, book your tickets online, ahead of time. You may not get on if you wait until the day of. (Here is the site we found extremely helpful when planning our trip)[--]	
Sep 26 2005	Great location and value	Just spent one night at the Handlery near Union Square. We were in the old part of the hotel but it was fine and a good value. In-room coffee and frig is a plus for us. Room was super clean and not too noisy. I think any older hotel in this location will have some noise as it's right near a very busy area. The proximity to Union Square is great. We ate at Lefty's for both breakfast and dinner are were very happy. Nothing fancy but great food. Parking is available at the rear of the hotel and they allow in-and-out for no charge for hotel guests and their rate was one of the lowest in the area. My only complaint would be that sometimes there is a bit of a wait at the bell desk to check or collect your bags. Once someone shows up they are usually quick to their task.	
Mar 13 2005	Very central to all you need	The handlery offered us a great rate for our stay of 4 nights - it was a clean - basic well serviced hotel - reception/valet staff could probably do with a little customer service training!! but at the deals they offer you cant complain. Very centrally located beside most main shopping areas and a taxi ride from the pier 39	
Aug 25 2004	Good Location	We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and found it excellent - lovely and clean, comfortable beds. The location was fantastic for us - just off Union Square and handy for shopping, the cable car etc.. The only downside was the room was cramped for the 4 or us (2 adults and 2 teenagers), but we did have one of the cheaper rooms - so not complaining.I had wondered whether to stay near Fishermans Wharf but glad we didn't as we found it a bit tacky.We didn't eat in the attached restaurant - but found some excellent diners just around the corner - good for breakfast. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.	
Aug 25 2004	HONEYMOONERS BEWARE!	We chose this hotel out of many others because the brochure said they offered a good honeymoon package and we'd read before on this site that people had been upgraded. Unfortunately, the room we got was terrible. It over looked a brick wall and the hotels main air ventilation pipe which hummed all day and night non stop.The honeymoon package consisted of a cheap bottle of wine, 2 apples, 2 oranges and a bag of pretzels.We didn't feel special one bit in this place. The staff were unattentive. Anyone can easily walk in off the street and take themselves around the hotel and non of the staff would realise, as we proved when we met up with friends and took them up to our room unchallenged.And one last thing, whatever you do, don't use the phone in your room. 20 minutes to the UK cost $170 (£95). Shame on you Handerlery.	
Aug 9 2006 	wonderful!	our last night of a 2 week holiday in california was spent here, having spent the 1st 4 nights at the crowne plaza on union square,{also excellent} we wanted to stay in a different area for the last night and were torn between the embarcadero and fishermans wharf - we made the right choice! the hotel is lovely - very different in style to all the others we stayed in and it was beautiful, from the lobby to the corridors to the room - lovely colourful bright decor. we were on the 8th floor in an inside room overlooking the courtyard - not a spectacular view but pleasant enough and nice and quiet. the room itself was smaller than the others we;d stayed in but was big enough for 2 easily and was very comfortable with a lovely little bathroom with very nice - aveda- products. there was a mini bar that we used for our own things - the only thing lacking was a coffee maker - i kept looking for it but it wasn;t there. having said that, there was free tea/coffee/water/juices etc in the lobby in the morning, but, being english, we do lke a cup of tea 1st thing without having to get dressed! the staff were wonderful, the marathon was on on the sunday and the road was closed supposedly until 2.30pm and our flight was at 4.20pm which meant we couldn;t get transport to pick us up - didn;t fancy lugging all our luggage to the bart! however the road re-opened early and the staff arranged for a shuttle to collect us so all was well - actually it was very exciting watching the marathon once we knew we were okay for getting to the airport! the location itself was lovely - just across from the ferry building and very close to the bay bridge, which looked lovely all lit up at night - some of the rooms on the front would have a view of it.we ate at afz 2 doors down at the hotel griffon which was excellent. there is also a free use computer in the lobby which meant i could check in on-line for the flight back - very glad i did when we saw the queues at checkin - this was a real plus as we didn;t expect to be able to do this not having a laptop with us. all in all the harbour court made the last night of a fabulous holiday complete.	
Nov 6 2009 	Great Location and Price But Very Funky.. The Dead Tree Inn	They should change the name since the palm tree shown by the pool was like 5 stories tall but very much dead, apparnetly for many years now. That sets the tone for this ill-maintained hotel that is a mostly dirty, smelly place. It smells like they have not updated the carpet since the 1970s when everyone smoked and the smell lives on, everywhere. Poor maid service, that is if you get any, and it apparently does not include clean sheets over 5 nights. The pool was dirty and the &quot;Breakfast&quot; was very week with small boxes of raisin bran and jugs of milk with weak coffee and OJ served up daily. Mostly Europeans were staying there, and apparently they did not know better, or the low ball Internet price of $41. brought them in. My view from the fifth floor was nice and I could see the Golden Gate Bridge, but my cable service was crappy and they could not fix it even though the one maintenance guy jiggled the wires and, well, I found myself doing the same and attempting to get a clear picture most nights. The final straw was on my final night at about 6:30 PM when I saw Pimps and their Prostitutes inside the halls of this very rough hotel in a great area close to Union Street and Fisherman's Wharf too. The free off street parking was also a plus. But the elevators both needed work and seemed unsafe. One goes from the 3rd floor to the 5th, but there is no way to get down to the street level. The other one features the sound of a metal cable dragging over the roof between the lobby and the first floor. Both elevators are in dire need of State Inspection and were overdue for a review. There were a ton of young folks partying on Halloween night, but the rest of the time I had the place to myself, except for the weary overseas travelers who apparently were oblivious that there were far nicer hotels in the area for perhaps $100. This place could easily have been situated in the Tenderloin. I think they should just give it up and tear it down and build something nice in this neighborhood.	
Nov 17 2004	Good budget hotel with an ideal location	Trip date 9 - 13th November 2004If you are looking for a good standard budget hotel the this one is for you. It isn't the Ritz but then it doesn't try to be. What you get is clean and tidy accomodation and the complimentry continental breakfast was plentiful and a pleasant surprise. The room was a reasonable size and well furnished, although the bathroom was looking a litte tired it was very clean.We found the property to be ideally located, only a 20 minute walk to Fishermans Wharf and only 10 minutes to Lombard St or Ghirardelli Square. Bus stops are very close for trips to Downtown, Fishermans Wharf or Golden Gate Bridge.Overall this was a good base to explore a great city and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.	
Apr 21 2008 	Nice View From Room	We stayed 2 nights over the weekend, $99/night at the hotel website. The hotel is in a good location - across from Chinatown and walking distant to Union Square and Financial District. If you're able to get the Bay View rooms, it's quite beautiful. The rooms are good if on the smaller side - not bad, not spectacular.Unless you have free breakfast, it really doesn't make sense to eat there for $20. The Executive Lounge is closed for the weekend but you get the free breakfast at their restaurant if you're with Hilton Honors. Parking is definitely ridiculous, but if you're there during the weekend, you can get street parking. Just be careful and read all the signs to avoid tickets.Overall, good overall and very good for the value.	
Jan 3 2008 	Very Average	Parking is offensively expensive! $48.00 per night vs. $26.00 across the street. The location was bellow average. It is in the heart of Chinatown, a car ride to everything a vacationing family would like to see (Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square, Shopping, non Chinese food etc....) No cotts or roll away beds available in the double room. Room itself was nice, clean and comfortable.	
Oct 10 2006 	Great Location great room great service	Just spent 2 nights in SF at the Hilton in the financial district. The room was beautiful and the view spectacular. We walked all over from there, to the warf and even ghirardelli square. When we wanted to travel further than that we found several modes of public transportation all within easy walking distance. We did not have an issue with excessive noise, however, it is the city and you can hear traffic. That's just the way it is! Staff was VERY friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. A great place to stay in SF.	
Oct 11 2006 	Excellent Location!	Like some of the other reviewers, I thought this hotel was in an excellent location in San Francisco. I went to San Francisco for the first time for a weekend visit, and this hotel was in the perfect location. It was about 2-3 blocks from the actual waterfront area, which is great because you do not have to deal with any of noise from the people hanging out there, but it is close enough for you to walk to the restaurants and shops. And it was not in the middle of downtown either. It was also close to the Chinatown/North Beach area with great little cafes and restaurants, and a great truffle place! Yum!Given that this was my first trip to SF, I wanted to see as much as I could in the city so I did not spend too much time in the actual hotel. When we got to the hotel, we were offered a free upgrade to a bigger room, which ended up being the handicapped-accessible room. That was actually a great thing because everything was bigger - the bathroom, bed, doorways, and especially the open space. And everything was clean. No view to speak of, but again, I was not there to spend time in the room staring out of the window. The people at the front desk were very helpful with suggestions on tours and restaurants. The self-parking was $28 a day with in and out privileges and high-speed internet access was $10 a day. There is a pool and an exercise room, neither of which I used. There is also a restaurant and bar in the lobby, but again, I did not visit either of them (and neither should you if you are vacationing in SF - tons of great restaurants all around the city!).I would definitely come back again. In the same area, there is also a Holiday Inn, Marriott, Hyatt, and Sheraton, so you might also want to consider those hotels as well if the location is the main attraction for you.	
Oct 22 2009 	Great Hotel	Overall it's a beautiful hotel. The only real complaint I have is that it's not equiped with all the electronic amenities as many hotels are these days. Wireless internet is only available in hotel common areas. To connect to the internet in your room, you have to plug in. TVs are dated and are not flat screen/LCD/plasma. Aside from that we had a great room with a fabulous view of the city. Housekeeping and other staff members were very friendly. Starbucks opened early on race day for all the runners in the area. Continental breakfast is awesome and includes a grande drink of your choice, pastry, water/soda/juice, and fruit!!! Couldn't ask for much more!!	
Aug 18 2009 	Nice Hotel but pricey	Hotel is very nice and I got a good price through a travel website but parking is quite high $45 a day ($30 a day across thestreet) and coffee or soda was very expensive. Highest price we have had to pay for daily internet access.	
Aug 8 2009 	Excellent location service amenities	I'll start this one with the negatives, of which there are very few: I think it's appalliing that a hotel of this size and caliber must charge even their Diamond Honors guests for access to the internet. Really, $15.95 per day? What an impressive profit margin that must generate! Also, the Starbucks in the lobby appears to be chronically understaffed, and lines for coffee in the morning are ghastly. Those are the only negatives I can think of.On the positive side, we loved our room (2900). We usually take two rooms when we travel, since we have two teenage boys, but this Jr. suite was large enough to accomodate all of us, including a rollaway bed, and never feel cramped. The housekeeping staff was wonderful, from the immaculate (and speedy) care they took of our space, to the wonderful man who brought our rollaway and thought we might need extra toiletries, extra towelsand water glasses, too, to the folks we passed in the halls who never failed to greet us and make us feel welcome. The front desk staff, bellmen, and concierge were friendly, helpful, and responsive. The lobby was comfortable and mostly spacious enough to find a seat and not be overwhelmed by crowds. We appreciated, as always, the amenities that come with Diamond Honors status, like free breakfast and use of the fitness center. If only it had also provided the internet access.There are excellent restaurants within walking distance, in addition to the Urban Tavern in the hotel, which was quite good.	
May 24 2008	Great Hotel	The lobby looked wonderful, and a pretty sitting area. Hotel staff were nice and helpful. The hotel room was nice with a luxurious Grand Bed, nice amenities, and a great view from the room. The restaurant was fancy with delicous continental breakfast, and a gift shop that has nice San Francisco souvenirs. it's a wonderful hotel. I would stay there again.	
Feb 19 2006	Loud and noisy	The Holiday Inn Civic Centre did not meet up to the normal standards of the Holiday inn's. When we arrived we were on the 11th floor which is identical to all the rest of the rooms. We got into our room to discover that it was very small and basic. The rooms had 2 so called 'double beds' which were only a little bit bigger than a single bed and a pull out sofa bed which took up alot of space when open. The Bathroom was ok but the bottem of the shower was all dirty and the toilet smelt and was dirty. The Balcony looked onto the local roads and sub way which didnt look that nice. When driving into the area of the hotel we noticed that it looked very rough. It had alot of disused buildings and there was alot of people living on the streets. When we arrived at the hotel, shortly after we heard a gun shot then alot of police vehicles arrived outside the hotel. This made us feel very cautious when walking on the streets. San Francisco is a big city and you don't get alot of sleep. well it doesn't help when your jet lagged and the beds are uncomftable but still it was very noisey outside the hotel and also there was a party going on in the room next door. I wouldn't reccomend this hotel at all and I think that Holiday Inn should be Ashamed.	
Oct 15 2008 	A good choice for Fishermans Wharf	This hotel is very well located - just around the corner from Fishernans Wharf. The breakfast being included in the price is a bonus - it is a bit of a bun fight but the food was fine and plentiful - cereals, yoghurt, toast, muffins etc, cinnamon buns, bananas as well as some hot options - scrambled eggs, sausages/bacon.Also you get the bonus of being able to use the pool next door at the main Holiday Inn Fishermans Wharf. The laundry also is over there.Our room had no outlook at all - just a window into an internal lightwell, but it was comfortable and quiet.There is a Denny's on site and Internet access terminals in the foyer.Basically everything we needed was there.	
Sep 29 2008 	It was just what we needed...	My wife and I stayed here at the start of a 16-day trip (for three nights). We knew we would be late arriving (having missed a connecting flight) and had phoned ahead with our expected arrival time. When we arrived we found that Reception had made of note of this and check-in was smooth. Our room was in the middle of the hotel (very nice and quiet) and it was just what we needed after a long trip from the UK. We were staying here over the Labor Day weekend, so the hotel was busy. We only really noticed this at breakfast, and whilst there was plenty of food for everyone we did notice that at around 8am one morning free tables were scare. A very minor point, and only to be expected, and it didn't cause any problems. The hotel is excellently situated, being between the ends of two cable car lines and one block from the street car (tram). We would definately stay here again and would recommend it to others.	
Apr 18 2008 	Good for the price	The good: - great location - clean, newer feeling hotel - decent breakfast - good servicethe bad: - very noisy, especially noise coming from hallway - small roomsBreakfast was much better than a continental breakfast, but maybe not quite as good as a Dennys or something. Each day had some type of egg, sausage or bacon, and a variety of breads, muffins, rolls, yogurt, juices, milk, coffee, etc. No pancakes, waffles, or anything like that.Rooms are pretty noisy. First night someone adjacent to us had a cough, so we got to hear that most of the night. Also, anytime someone shut a door or talked in the hallway it sounded almost like they were in your room.Location was great. You can walk to all the areas in Fisherman's wharf, to the Alcatraz Pier 33 (15 mins) parts of Golden Gate National Rec Area, Ghiradelli, Cannery, Powell/Hyde cable car turnaround, etc.	
Oct 25 2008 	Great base for looking around San Francisco	Like many of the reviewers we found ourselves in the Beach Road property - does anyone actually get to stay in the main building and if so who are you?The walk from the main building wasn't too bad, although we had just been traveling for about 12 hours and had loads of luggage. The smell from Denny's in the lobby is not great, but you kind of get used to it (not enough to go and eat there). Our room was on the third floor at the end of the corridor facing onto the street, though this rarely caused a problem during our stay.The room was reasonably spacious and importantly clean. The shower was good and the bed comfortable. The internet access was wireless and free and that was important for us. We were just minutes away from the whole fisherman's wharf area and had good access to transport systems if we wanted it. The hotel was just what we needed as a base for looking around San Francisco.	
Oct 7 2009 	posizione fantastica !!!		
Mar 28 2006	Golden Gate Holiday Inn	Well, my husband just returned from a long weekend in San Francisco and what a great city. Lots of things to do and see.We were a little worried about our hotel after reading the reviews, but from the moment we got there it was great. Marvin (front desk) checked us in 4 hrs early and upgraded us to a king room with a view. The hotel was clean, the room was small as well as the bathroom, but the view was great. We only slept in our room, so it didn;t matter.Would highly recommend getting a MUNI pass as the transit system is amazing. Took us all over the city without having to use a taxi once.Took a couple of side trips to Santa Cruz and also to Napa Valley. Definitely a must.Read that Pier 39 was overated, but is something to see. Was able to see the sea lions basking in the sun. Ghiradelli Square to get some chocolate, sat outside at the San Francisco Brewing Company and people watched during happy hour (cheap beer).Was a great city to see, lots to do and never a dull moment.	
Apr 22 2004	Would definately stay again		
Oct 14 2009 	Très bon hôtel superbe localisation!		
Nov 29 2007 	Very nice	My wife is picky about hotels and not easily impressed. The lobby was a good start-- easy on the eye, jazzy techno in the background. The staff was friendly and helpful with hints like &quot;don't waste your time at Pier 39.&quot; But when the missus entered our room, she exclaimed: &quot;Oh, hell yes.&quot; Cool furniture, nice bed and bathroom. Plenty of space. There was even a small couch and an i-pod adapter on the nightstand. I'd done well picking this place.	
Apr 17 2006	Nice Hotel Location Questionable	We stayed at the Hotel Adagio for 3 nights on our first trip to San Francisco. Our room was a King on the 11th floor, and the size of room, and amenities offered (tea/cookies in the afternoon), workout room (which we used) were nice. However, the hotel is located next to the Tenderloin area. There were many homeless on the street corners in about a 3 block radius and were rather aggressive in their panhandling. We will consider staying in another area of San Francisco on our next visit. However, we would stay at another joie de vivre hotel and is one we would recommend.	
Feb 25 2005	It was just all right...	We stayed here for our one year anniversary celebration. We were very excited, and upon check in felt that since we were so young, we did not receive the service expected. Our &quot;jacuzzi&quot; (which was promised) was just a regular tub. The staff was quiet and did not offer to help us or even acknowledge that we were entering or leaving the hotel. Nothing was bad, but nothing was spectacular either.	
Jul 6 2009 	Good service and nice rooms	We were supposed to stay at Hotel Bijou for two nigths but because of some problems with their computer systems they had overbooked the hotel. This was not a problem though. They had made reservations for us at a nearby hotel with a better standard and when we came back for our second night (now at the Bijou) a bottle of complimentary chilled wine waited for us. A nice gesture if you ask me.The rooms were nice. Our was quite large and had a view of Mason Street and Eddy Street. Breakfast was okey too. Bagels, cereals, juice and coffee.	
Feb 4 2008	Tasteful Room Great Staff Good Value	This is an older hotel that has been updated tastefully, while keeping the character of the old building (something that hotels rarely do, in my experience). The room was very nice and clean, although a tad small, but this is no big deal in a large city like San Francisco. The lobby was actually a nice place to hang out and visit with friends. The staff were extremely nice and helpful, even volunteering to print out my boarding pass for me at one point, and offering me chocolate cupcakes at another point. This place is a bit off the beaten path, but it is adorable and a good value.	
Aug 23 2007	Great find. Superb service.	After another hotel in the neighborhood lost my reservation that was made four months in advance on their own website, I was forced to scramble the day before my July 12th flight to find another place to stay. Given the reviews I read here, I called the Hotel Carlton and was absolutely blown away by how well I was treated. The timing was too close to send me an email confirmation, but the reservation agent made sure I had the name of the desk manager who assured me that my reservation was all in order. When I checked in, I was treated as though I had been a long term client who booked ages in advance. I was given a great corner room that was quiet and had a great view. The room was bright, comfortable and charming.The location of the hotel was perfectly suited to my needs and it was nice to have a little restaurant in the same building that served breakfast, even though there were plenty of other restaurants nearby to choose from. The focus on service was exhibited by every staff member I encountered, from the bellman to the restaurant staff, the maids and front desk people. I even got a personal response from Theo McKinney, the Guest Experience Manager, as a follow up to my post-stay Satisfaction Survey. These folks exemplify the meaning of &quot;hospitality.&quot;This is going to be my regular hotel from now on for San Francisco.	
Sep 2 2007 	Great place to stay with your kids	A friend of a friend recommended this place for our 3 night stay in San Francisco. Everything was wonderful. We arrived and there were freshly baked cookies for all. Parking was free. The kids hung out at the pool each afternoon, and a continental breakfast helped us get going in the morning. We loved the neighborhood (happy to be out of the Union Square buzz) and found the the Hotel Del Sol staff could direct us by bus anywhere we wanted to go. We walked a lot, found great local restaurants and a great organic type supermarket all nearby. We also had the suite room (separate spaces for adults and kids). Would return here in a minute.	
Sep 23 2009 	Tiny  funky but not great for small children	This hotel is just a stone's throw from the Chinatown Gates and downtown shopping. The rooms are poky but comfortable - the storage cupboards going a long way to make this combination possible. The bathrooms, however, in an attempt to be quaint (clawfoot bath) make a small space excruciatingly small. Likewise, the elevator was almost impossible to navigate with large baggage.But this is an old, refurbished and cute hotel, so of course the rooms aren't going to be large if the the owners stay true to the original in their restoration. It's just not a great option for those travelling with small children. Not sure about the charm of the old plumbing - the toilets get clogged with just an average amount of toilet paper!The painted rooms are very cool and interesting and you get to decide on your top 3, with the hotel doing their best to accommodate your choice. The breakfast was nice if you don't want to linger and just grab a quick bite to eat before hitting the tourist wheel.Overall a funky, small but very affordable choice for such a great location.	
Apr 21 2006 	clean dream	worth the money and the search. hard to find hotel at night. but once found, it was a dream. a totally different design and decor. refreshing from the run of the mill big hotels. my room was clean and tidy. i received an amenity in my room from the sales department. i had excellent service from the front desk. very helpful. i felt like a dad though with most checking in being in there 20's and 30's. definetely for a young corporate type, but i felt young being there.my son had the room next to me. he liked the dvd vending maching and the gym. he said the gym was better than any other hotel i've takin him with me too. im come here often to the main office, so i'll be back.	
Apr 26 2008	Wonderful hotel	My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Hotel Drisco in San Francisco. We absolutely loved this hotel! We made our reservation months in advance and were thrilled to receive such amazing service and attention even prior to our arrival. Elizabeth at the front desk generously answered many e-mails with wonderful advice as to car rental, restaurants, and area attractions. Bob gracefully handled the front door greeting duties, welcoming us by name when we arrived. Our room was perfect. Room 406A! It was a two-room suite that had to be about 800 sq. feet. With the high ceilings, plentiful windows on two sides of the room, two flat screen TVs (one in the living room and one in the bedroom), very comfortable bed, and full amenities, we were most content. This particular room is reached by entering through a door into a private hallway. It was a very quiet room, something that is very important to us when we travel. In fact, we never heard another guest while in our lovely room. The furniture and draperies are simple and nice (not luxurious, but quite cheery and pleasant) and the rooms were immaculately clean. We thought the bathroom was beautiful. For a property as old as this one is, it was impeccably maintained. We enjoyed the little touches such as robes and slippers set out at turndown service along with cookies, bottled water, and the next days weather report. We also liked the 24-hour coffee and tea available in the hotels sitting room as we were able to take coffee to go when we set out to explore each day. It was a little warm our first night, though with the windows open and the fan the hotel provided, we had a most comfortable first nights rest.As room 406A is on the back left side of the property (which sat upon a very steep hill-it is San Francisco, after all), it felt like we were much higher up from ground level, providing unobstructed views of the city. If we peered out the living room windows and looked to the left, we could see the San Francisco Bay. We loved the spaciousness, peacefulness, and privacy this room provided. And the walks around the neighborhood (the expensive Pacific Heights neighborhood) were spectacular. In a simple mile-loop (the hotel provides a map), one can walk past mansions worth tens of millions of dollars. So not only can one gaze upon the beautiful San Francisco Bay on this stroll, but you can gape at the beauty of neighborhood dwellings. The Presidio park is also a block from the hotel, providing easy access to walks in the forest. We loved being able to park within a block of the hotel for free and access our vehicle whenever we wished. We also enjoyed the peaceful of this property versus staying within the craziness and congestion of San Francisco proper. Visits to most San Francisco sights were only a 10-minute drive. We would imagine some of the rooms whose windows looked out over the front entrance of the hotel might be exposed to the conversational noise of passing pedestrians or lingering hotel guests, but I suspect it is not a significant problem as it really is a quiet neighborhood with little street traffic. Breakfast is free every morning in the sunny and bright dining room with several copies of The San Francisco Chronicle, NY Times, and Wall Street Journal available to read. Breakfast is buffet-style with croissants, scones, cereal, toast, bagels, oatmeal, and fruit. Breakfast can also be delivered in your room at no extra charge. The service at breakfast as in the rest of the hotel was perfection. The staff was kinder than that at The Four Seasons properties at which we usually stay when we travel. When we visit San Francisco again, we will definitely stay here again for the personal attention of the staff, the privacy, the cleanliness of the property, the peace and quiet, and well, the bang for the buck. It was a positively fantastic value considering the level of service and lovely accommodations we received. We enjoy perfection when we travel and we found it here.	
Mar 15 2008 	Superb Experience!	I arrived midday during a business trip and needed to get some work done and found myself in a beautiful room with all the amenities to make my &quot;office time&quot; great. Sunny, spacious, and supremely comfortable. Fantastic, gracious staff...very personal...almost felt like I was staying in a private inn or B&amp;B. Wonderful neighborhood. This hotel entirely changed my view (literally and figuratively) of SF, as I'd only stayed in downtown hotels on past visits.I'd recommend to colleagues, family or friends (and already have!). I will definitely visit again when returning to SF.	
Oct 4 2006 	Wonderful Find	The hotel is found among the residences of Pacific Heightswhich makes the hotel very peaceful. The staff went out of there way in accomadating any of our requests. I will come back on mu nexy visit to San Francisco.	
Oct 11 2004	Drisco is Wonderful!	The Hotel Drisco is very attractive, comfortable, spacious and includes LOADS of amenities for free. Breakfast, wine and hors d'oeuvres, high speed internet in the room, all included. The rooms are very reasonably priced and the staff is well informed and friendly. For a stay in the Pacific Heights area, this may be the best. I happen to prefer this location to downtown.	
Jun 3 2008 	Great location for short stay a little bit on the noisy side...	Stayed here for one night prior to an Alaskan cruise from SF in mid May. Weather was nice in the high 60's-70's Hotel is conveniently located short 5 minutes walk from BART ( less than $10 pp) Powell exit, though we took shuttle (Lorrie, about $30 for 2) from airport since we got 3 big piece of luggages, didnt want to lug them around even for 1 block.Hotel is centrally located closed to Union Square &amp; across from Parc 55 which I also stayed years ago, a different class of hotel. Since this is just for 1 night and per TA recommendation I though I gave it a try. Hotel reception is fine, staff are friendly and efficient. I didnt need much help from them since I've been to SF many times but they are there when one does need help.Stayed on the 3rd floor, room was slightly stuffy when first entered which immediately opening the window helped since there was cool breeze. Kept window opened all night and a fan in the room helped circulate air, so no problem there. Only problem is for the night we were in, there were some night owls on the street making strange noises, plus some garbage truck or street cleaning vehicle were making noises that was kind of annoying but can get used to it. For those who are noise sensitive can be a problem.As others have mentioned, free continental breakfast on 5th floor and free internet use on 3rd floor. Within 10 to 15 minutes walk, one can cover Union Square, Westfield Mall, Chinatown, access to cable cars, buses, BART etc. A fine 2-3 stars hotel that cost us about $145 (tax and fee included).Also if one likes Chinese food, Tian Sing is in the same building on ground floor. I understand one of the chefs from Yang Sing (which I've been to few times) opened this one. They are both quite good for dim sum.	
Jan 25 2007	Nice Hotel for the $	We stayed at the Hotel Fusion during Fleet Weekend. The hotel is near union square and the Powell St cable car. The location couldn't be better. Check in was uneventful. Our room wasn't ready, but we were there at noon. We left our bags and went to lunch and when we returned our room was ready as promised. The rooms are small but nice. Ours had a king bed, fridge and a nicely redone bath. No air conditioning and because it was very warm we needed to have the window open at night. The street noise was pretty bad, but I knew that would be the case when I booked the room. Overall I would say we got a good value for our money.	
Nov 8 2007 	problematic stay!	Having just undergone rennovation there was no room service, no mini bar and alarms that went off in the night. The restaurant is currently closed. The neighborhood closes early and by 8pm there is no local convenience store, you need a cab to get a soda!	
Jul 2 2004	Not That Great	I was put in a tiny back room facing another building. The room was about 10x10. It was the smallest room I had ever seen. The bed took up half the room and the wall paper was all ripped up. I was expecting the most romantic hotel in SF and this was worse than staying at a motel 6. So, I called the front desk and they put me in an average size room with a fireplace. The fireplace barely even worked and the room smelled like gas. The only thing sort of romantic about that room is that they had a fancy headboard and a nice looking fireplace (even though it didnt work well and smelled like gas). And the window didnt open which made the smelly room even worse. I would not pay over $65 to stay at this hotel again. It was NOT ALL THAT.	
Mar 29 2007 	Awesome boutique hotel - Best price and Value in Union Square	This was my second trip to the hotel. I stayed there 2 years ago and thought it was just a wonderful boutique hotel. I returned there last weekend and had a pleasant surprise - they did a very gorgeous renovation and the hotel was even more appealing.Beautiful warm colors, nice furnishings, and waterfall display in the lobby. Rooms are very comfortable and have most ammenities that larger chain hotels have.The staff are all very courteous and willing to help in any situation. They added a restaurant called Farmer's Brown. WONDERFUL food!!!This hotel, is without a doubt, the BEST VALUE in Union Square. The hotel remembered me from 2 years ago and sent 2 bottles of compliementry chamagne.Thanks so much Hotel Metropolis! I will tell everyone about our wonderful experience!!!!!! As your Governator says - &quot;I will be back&quot;!!!	
Mar 22 2004	Loved the Hotel Milano	We just had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Milano a week ago and would love to rave about our stay. The hotel was incredible and very comfortable. The hotel personnel made our stay a worthwhile visit to the Bay Area and could not wait until our next visit. Not only do they have the most gracious and helpful staff but the location of the hotel was covenient for all those travelling in downtown San Francisco. Hotel Milano was a home away from home experience.	
Dec 1 2008 	Great location and bargain	Beautiful corner room at a bargain basement discount price over Thanksgiving weekend. Very helpful staff; concierge's know their SF restaurants. A+.	
May 29 2009 	Excellent just excellent	The Palomar San Francisco is a great hotel in a great location just off Market Street, near a BART station, tram stops, and not too far from the Caltrain station which is further down 4th street (a 20 minute walk away). The hotel itself is excellent, the experience starts at the front desk when you check in, and throughout your stay the staff are excellent, and the rooms too are very well appointed, with a great bathroom. City centres can be stressful places, but when you step into the Palomar you feel like you leave the city behind. I highly recommend the hotel, for business and tourists alike, the location is excellent, with excellent rooms, and fabulous staff. My one tip is to avoid one of the rooms facing onto the internal 'zen garden', these are smaller rooms, with no view.	
Dec 13 2005	Be happy to come back	Visiting San Francisco on business, I did not have enough time to the good things the hotel had to offer. No time to visit the famed French restaurant on the fifth floor... The room I had was spacious, nicely decorated. Bed was firm, had down pillows, and I loved their turn-down service. Their business center on the fifth floor was unattended but well maintained. Even if you travel without your personal computer, you can check email, browse web or print material there. It was also ideal for browsing nespapers in the morning. What I loved most was their DVD/CD player. I wish to come back for a leisure visit so that I can take fuller advantage of this hotel...	
May 22 2005	This hotel has ROTTEN service stay at your own risk.	We arrived to check in after a lengthy car trip and were told that because of &quot;a strange event&quot; our deluxe king had been downgraded to a small room with a sofa bed. When we asked what the &quot;strange event&quot; was, we were informed by the manager that expedia customers are not guaranteed the room they book even when they prepay. I asked if they still had deluxe kings available if I were to book with them directly and they said yes. We told the manager this was unacceptable, he said nothing. No apology, nothing. When we got Expedia on the phone and they talked to him, they said he was unpleasant. What stunned us was there was no apology, no recognition we were about to be massively inconvenienced, nothing. No comp, nothing. Stone-faced and unwilling to concede we were customers. It is as if we are doing them a favor staying at their hotel. We decided to go elsewhere and will never stay at a Kimpton hotel again.Unfortunately, poor service seems to be a hallmark of Kimpton. We stayed at the Vintage Plaza in Portland -- no wake calls, forgot to call town car, bad room next to heat exchanger. Kimpton is style over substance, with a sniffy attitude froms staff. Bad service is not isolated at Kimpton. Do them a favor and stay there or do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.Awful, awful, awful.	
Sep 29 2004	A real disappointment	Palomar reviewWe were put in a very small room (Cruise ship cabin size) rm 519.Cheerful staff, but not really helpful. We asked for additional towels, but they never arrived. The front desk did not have any change for tips (no change for a $20). The Fifth Floor lounge is supposed to close at 12:00 on Friday, but was not serving any more after 11:00pm. The in room safe is located in the small closet, need to remove bag stand and any luggage in closet to access room safe. Could be considered an extra level of security.$36-per day parking charge is the highest I have ever paid. take BART then cab it. There are the usual assortment of bums and winos on Market Street, but not in front of the hotel.This place is not worth the money-definitely not a 4 star property in my opinion.The view of Old Navy from our cabin was a new take on window shopping , some interior rooms had a view of a garden with fountain.comfy bed, very sm bath, pocket door, nice furnishings in room.Other rooms seemed a little bigger than ours. We did not have time when we checked in to request another room. I don't know if it would have helped.Newspapers available only if you ask they are not offered or provided with room service breakfast.	
Nov 18 2009 	Exceptional quality and economy near UnionSquare	Hotel Rex is a gem. The decor is original, the customer service is exceptional, and the room rates are highly reasonable. Panache for the value-conscious visitor.I booked a reservation three weeks in advance for a reunion of classmates (15). The hotel was chosen by reputation, location, value, and friendliness to pets. It didn't disappoint and in fact exceeded all expectations. The dog care was exceptional (my cockapoo can't wait to return to see Jeff in reception). The charming lobby was ideal for drinks before dinner. Our group had a memorable and intimate dinner in the hotel's Cafe Andree; our server was attentive and accommodating.All of my classmates raved about their experience at Hotel Rex.	
Oct 9 2009 	The best boutique hotel we've ever stayed in!	We selected this hotel for our 32nd wedding anniversary/vacation base. Stayed from Aug. 26-Sept. 4. The Joie de Vivre hotel chain made this hotel stay the best of any we've ever experienced in our world travels. Decorators were inspired by the New Yorker Magazine and strove to create a 1930's California literary/art scene. From the decor to the furniture, Steinbeck et al quotations/ charicatures/wall art, paintings, color scheme, Society list pages in the elevators, library-club-like lobby to lemon and thyme scented toiletries and lemon/green/black room decor, all were well thought out. The hotel excited all of our senses. They asked guests to donate to support a literary charity, in keeping with their overall theme. Everything was wonderful--location, services, food, etc. Convenient to everything we wanted. Only the amount of time it took for the valet to retrieve our rental car from the remote lot (we paid a daily fee) was excessive and visitors should allow a little extra slack if they need their vehicles. We used public transportation -bus, trolley, taxi (including one with a resident parrot!) and were very happy. Five stars!******	
Sep 15 2007 	Never again.	We love boutique hotels until we stayed at the Triton. The Triton is not a boutique but rather a budget hotel. The room was small (tiny) and the bathroom had no space for our toiletries. The room needed to be refurbished and because of this appeared unkept. We had a view of an alley. We paid $181 a night with taxes. We heard from a friend who lives in San Francisco that the going rate for a room at the Triton isbetween $80-$90 a night and that would be an appropriate price for this property.The hotel advertised Frete sheets and we had one on the bed. They advertised Aveda products and we got one very small bar of soap for two people. I encouraged another couple to stay at the Triton and they left the next day. They found a rather elegant room a few blocks away for the same price. We stayed because we did not want the hassle of moving for a short Labor Day weekend trip. I wrote the hotel with these observations and to date have received no response. I read the Trip Advisor before booking and since the reviews were so mixed i decided to give it a try. Big Mistake on my part.	
Mar 25 2006	Good location reasonable accomodation	My husband and I were very excited about staying at this hotel at the beginning of our honeymoon as it seemed a bit different from the norm. We stayed in a number of different hotels during our trip and this was our least favourite as it was just a little bit tired.The location of this hotel is good, although we found that there are only a couple of decent restaurants in close proximity to the hotel. The lobby was nice but we started to see tired decor on stepping out of the lift on our floor. There had been a leak outside of one of the rooms and the wallpaper was all peeling off, with plaster and paper lying on the carpet. Our room was not very spacious but big enough. It was in need of some upgrading though in order to make it the trendy boutique hotel it is advertised as. The bed however was very comfortable and the bathroom facilities were fine, if a bit cramped.We found the reception staff helpful, but housekeeping don't give you much warning before bursting in so make sure to use your lock or do not disturb if you want to avoid that!!Overall we thought that you could find a better hotel for the money but this one would do fine for a central location for a few nights.	
Jul 25 2004	What a Fun Hotel!	A friend and I stayed at the Triton Hotel on 7/23/04. It is a great place to stay if you want a lively boutique hotel with friendly service. The beds were very comfy. Complimentary wine is served from 5pm to 6pm every evening in the lobby where guests gather to talk, get a massage, or have their Tarot cards read! We met people from all over the world. There was also live music. At 3pm and 8pm the hotel serves warm, delicious cookies! The staff were extremely accommodating giving us a later check-out time and happily answering our questions. This hotel is located within a few minutes of Union Square and right at the Gate to China Town and a short walk to North Beach. We also took one of the SF Library free tours and the Java Walk tour with Elaine Sosa, a lively, energetic and fun tour guide who showed us some cool coffee houses in the area ($20) and educated us with some interesting facts about the city.	
Nov 28 2008 	Hôtel très satisfaisant dans sa catégorie		
Jan 14 2009 	Wonderful little hotel	First of all, this place is smack in the middle of everything - you walk outside and you're right there in Union square, just a few steps from Market Street. We stayed two nights. The room decor was very sleek, as well as the general design of the whole hotel. The bed was comfortable and the shower had a giant rain-like head. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful to someone unfamiliar with the city - they all really went above and beyond. Parking is kind of expensive, but apparently this is very common in San Fran. Overall, I found this hotel to be a joy to stay at, and not too expensive either. After my stay I filled out their online survey and the CEO personally emailed me to respond to my comments... how's that for personal service? I liked this place a lot and I plan on returning. Cheers!	
Aug 7 2008 	Will be back	I stayed at Hotel Union Square twice recently and had two great experiences!  The first one was with my friends for a ladies night in the city and we had so much fun! We stayed in one of the double bed rooms, which was great and quiet although right next to the street. The beds were comfy and chic, we took lots and lots of pictures while getting ready only because room, light and furniture were so nice. The bathroom was big enough for us, only the sink was way too small, you could not even wash your hands without having water all over the floor, but whatever! The front desk agent helped us with getting into a secret bar were you need to know the location, ring the bell and know a password - thank you for that! Everybody else was friendly and helpful as well. Some weeks later I stayed there with my boyfriend. I reserved one of the petite queen rooms but got an upgrade to one of the Executive king rooms, which was amazing! Such a big spacious room, lots of big mirrors, three large windows you can open, a separate sink and bathroom with tub. They do not have a restaurant, but who cares, you are in the middle of everything. The location is the best reason to stay there.  I made already a couple of more reservations throughout the year and I would recommend this place for young couples and friends, maybe not for older people. But still - I had a great time with two totally different occasions.	
Feb 5 2007 	Don't Bother	Our stay at this hotel was one of the worst hotel experiences that I have had in a long time. When we got there we were given a room on the 2nd floor directly next to a room that was under renovation. The contractors banged, sawed and let profanities fly until 6 PM that evening. They finally left after we complained to the staff that we had had enough and would like to lie down and try to relax a bit before dinner. This was after the power to our room was cut off so the electrician could wire the outlets next door. Additionally, the heat in our room didn't work and the bed was as hard as a rock. As we finally got to sleep early in the morning hours, there were patrons running and shouting through the hallways. I would rate my experience on par with my days back in the college dormitory. When we checked out, I was expecting an apology or maybe even an adjustment on the hotel rate but nothing. Never again would I stay or recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. Too bad since the location is awesome.	
Oct 24 2006 	Won't go back	I was a bit leery after reading other reviews, but I figured, &quot;at this price, I'll survive a bit of inconvenience.&quot; I was wrong. Even though SF was in a cold-snap, upon arriving in my room, it was stuffy and uncomfortably hot. The window in my room opened to a parking lot, and would only stay open when propped up with my notebook. When I asked for a fan, they said b/c my room had a ceiling fan, they didn't have one for me. The beds were tired (springs would go bioooo-ing, when I shifted my weight (which is rediculous, as I weigh approx. 120lbs.), and the bathroom was so tight I had to straddle the toilet to close the door, in order to reach the light switch behind it.All this being said, the location is fabulous, and when I asked the hotel staff to leave my window open during the day, the room was more tolerable. Bring ear plugs and your patience.	
Feb 2 2006	Union Square Hotel 114 Powell Street	My Girlfriend and I have just came back form staying at this great Hotel. 114 Powell Street. The location to all forms of transport, and the value and service we recieved, makes this hotel a standout for me. The room was large, and cozy at the same time, the decor of our room was fantastic, kind of like a NYC loft. The Hotel Lobby has jsut been rennovated, and looks awesome, and the staff couldnt have been nicer, or more friendly. I can understand why people have had problems with the noise of the cable cars clanning there bells at all hours, but personally i thought it was part of the fun of the room, so either ask for a &quot;courtyard&quot; facing room, or do as i did and put in ear plugs that you get on your flight over.To sum up, loved this place, and wouldn't hesitate in going back, or telling people to go there.	
Oct 11 2008 	Terrific deal just off Union Square!	We come to San Francisco several times a year for ACT and discovered the York on our last visit. The price is a great deal in an expensive town, and the location - ten minutes walk from the theater - is perfect. The staff couldn't be more helpful, and although we had one of the older rooms which hasn't been renovated yet, everything was pleasant, clean and comfortable. We've stayed in many of the high-priced establishments around Union Square, but the York is our new go-to hotel in San Francisco - highly recommended!	
Nov 6 2007	Set the standards high for the rest of the hotels we stayed at	We started a 14-day vacation with 5 days in San Francisco at this fantastic hotel. From the minute we entered the hotel lobby we recieved a friendly welcome from the Bell men to the Front Desk where we were upgraded (without even asking) to an unbeliveable room with a panaramic view of the ocean and the Bay Bridge. Our room had a soaking tub, a separate room with a spacious glass encased shower with a rain spout and double sinks and another spacious separate room with the toilet and another sink. Our king bed was extremely comfortable and the room came with a flat screen tv/bose sound system and soothing cd's were left by the bed. There were two sets of Robes and slippers awaiting us and the turn down service at night always left a supply of complimentary water with chocolates on the pillow and an update of the next day's weather. The hotel had a media room with complimentary use of computers for the guests. There was always complimentary fresh coffee waiting for us in the lobby in the morning. The workout room was very clean and a nice size and we enjoyed massages at the spa. We enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant downstairs and their outdoor dining with the firepit was a nice touch. The location of the hotel to the ferry building and the sunrises from the balcony were fabulous. The concierge Jackie was extremely helpful in getting us into a romantic restaurant at the last minute and we have to give a special THANKS to Lucky Sanabria who took the time to notice the wine we were drinking at the &quot;Wine'd Down Hour&quot; that the hotel offered and sent a complimentary bottle to our room. This would have to be my favorite hotel and we travel a lot. I look forward to coming back to San Francisco and staying at the Hotel Vitale where the service is friendly yet professional!	
Aug 31 2007 	Perfect location for families with kids ages 7-12	Our family of 5 (my husband, 3 boys, and I) just spent 4 nights at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf. If you are looking for a convenient location, clean, quiet room for a family -- this was great. We had 2 cable car stops within less than a 5 minute walk. We used them to go to Union Square, Lombard Street, Chinatown and the Cable Car Museum. We could walk to Ghiradelli Square, the Cannery, the Wharf, and Pier 39. We also could walk to our rental car pickup (Enterprise) and the F line (street car) easily. We used the F to get to the pier for the Alcatraz cruise and to go to the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market . We were able to take a city bus to the Marina easily. We also used the bus to go to Golden Gate Park (although it was a bit of a haul). We were only a block away from the firetruck tour -- which by the way, was the absolute best part of the trip!! I can't recommend it enough! My main point is that the Hyatt at the Wharf's location is great for families who are heading to San Francisco to sightsee. We debated as to whether we should stay in the Union Square or the Wharf area. The Wharf is definitely the way to go for sightseeing families with kids. The rooms were clean and the hotel was quiet. We did use the pool twice, but briefly -- it was chilly. The pool really shouldn't be a factor when choosing a hotel in San Francisco. There is so much to see and do. We got the Rise and Shine rate which included a full breakfast buffet (very nice) voucher for 2 people each morning. We actually used 4 of the vouchers for 2 of the mornings and paid the extra $9 for one child. That way we didn't feel obligated for all of us to eat there every morning. While the breakfast buffet was great, the dinner at the hotel restaurant was not the best -- and they charged for refills of the kids' lemonades. We had friends stay at the Argonaut at the same time. They said it was nice and it was only a block or two from us, so they had the same convenient location. I would probably try the Argonaut if I went again. Not because there was anything bad about the Hyatt -- we had no problems whatsoever. I just think the Argonaut looked a little bit nicer from the outside.	
Aug 16 2007 	Great Hotel Loved the Bedding!	Overall....it was a great experience. Hyatt did a great job remodeling the rooms and the beds were by far the most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel. The bedding was plush and very comfortable. The only problem we encountered was with someone from the front desk who didn't appear concerned with trying to work with us when we requested a room that was large enough to fit a roll out bed. As we were checking out I noticed that there was another couple who was having a hard time as well with the same front desk person. Everyone else was very nice and very helpful. One of the people who works at the concierge gave us wrong information regarding where to by trolley and bus passes. Honestly, some of the homeless were more helpful than this person was! Overall, we were very happy and would definitely go back!	
Feb 22 2009 	Regency Club is like a 5 star Hotel with in a 4 star Hotel. Great Job Hyatt SF	I had 7 faster free nights that I needed to use before Feb. 28. So I took the Cal Train into the city and spent 9 nights at they Hyatt Regency. As a Hyatt Diamond Member I was upgraded to the Regency Club Level, Balcony Bay View, and I loved every second of it, was hard to leave. The Regency Club Rooms occupy the top 2 floors, and the club is on top of the hotel with an awesome views of the Bay Bridge, The Bay, and the Financial District. Each night the club had a wonderful spread of hous D'oenuvers, and in the morning a generous continental breakfast. The rooms have been renovated and are tastefully decorated with large plasma tv in the room, and a tv located in the bathroom mirror. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and professional. I would like to spend a special thanks to the housekeeping staff for the friendly 5 star service they provided. Every morning when I returned from breakfast my room was clean!!! Amazing it like they knew my schedule. I've stayed at almost every Hyatt, and one of my pet peaves is not having my room cleaned by 12 noon, and encountering a cold housekeeping staff. Thanks again Hyatt Regency San Francisco, you have the best Regency Club and Housekeeping Staff, it was an experience I will never forget.	
Aug 10 2005	good hotel but nothing unique	A nice hotel in a great city. Nice location. I read a review from someone else here describing the lobby as &quot;a lot of dusty, fake greenery.&quot; I do agree, the lobby is big, but not bright and cheery. It's you typical large city convention hotel, not too much character. I have come to the conclusion that longtime business travelers have know for a long time: it doesnt matter what the brand of hotel is, they are all the same in a city. Please please please don't pay more just because this is a Hyatt because it could easily be any other hotel. The name means nothing in a city. When visiting San Francisco, dont have a car unless you need it. This hotel is located with public transit right outside your door. The California line for trolley cars is just feet from the door, BART and the MUNI metro are across the street. The F-Line streetcars run right by the hotel and go to Fishermans Warf and Union Square. The ferry building is located in the back of the hotel and will take you to Sausalito. We even got to Muir Woods without a car by using the very comfortable and efficient Golden Gate Transit Buses. The embarcadero and ferry building is fun to hang out at on an afternoon for a long lunch and lazy day of shopping. There was an art festival with vendors and such on the weekend when we were there. The hotel rooms are about the normal size for a city hotel. The bathroom is quite small and not all that luxiourus. The Mini-bar is computerized so dont think your storing anything of yours in there. It's overpriced as usual ($3.50 for a can of soda) but once in a while its fun to empty it out when your business is paying. Otherwise, there is a Walgreens, 7-11 and Starbucks located across the street for more reasonable snacking. The fitness center is small and there is no pool. We did not see the revolving restaurant. I will warn you that we ate at the breakfast buffet in the morning for free but if your paying it's an outrageous $20 per person! Its good food but not worth that much!If you have ever been to NYC you will appreciate this comparison. If you love time square and all of its tackiness, stay at Fishermans Warf. If you enjoy the more laid back areas that are not as touristy then stay out of the Warf area. If you have any questions about the transit in the area of the hotel dont hesitate to email me.	
Aug 10 2009 	Wonderful stay worth the hike!!!	my husband and I just returned from 5 wonderful nights at the Mark Hopkins. Sincce we have never been to San Francisco before,I used a combination of Trip Advisor and AARP to select a hotel. We had an excellent package that included breakfast and parking ( which a lot of reviewers complain about the cost of both),so book directly with the hotel for the best rates on packages. Every staff member was attentive and friendly. The room we had on the 15th floor faced south, with a wonderful view. Didnot do top of the mark at night,as we do not do the bar scene, and had breakfast there most mornings. We had a king bed,that was comfy. Room service was reasonable and quick ( we ordered pizza after returning from the night alcatraz tour - which is also a must and needs to book early before leaving home).Concierge helped us book city tour. Definitely buy a city pass or muni pass so you can go wherever and whenever, as you do tire from all the walking. We found out August is the height of tourist season, so be patient, as you may have to wait in line for Cable cars and trolleys- but remember you are on vacation to relax, and the Mark Hopins is great for that.	
Jun 30 2009 	Great rate great stay (but beware staying by the elevator)	My husband and I stayed for three nights when visiting my sister. I am a Priority Club member and they had a fantastic rate ($119). When we arrived we were upgraded to suite. It was a lovely suite and was clean and well appointed. The only wrinkle is that it was the room next to the elevator. It was noisy. We debated on changing rooms, but ultimately stayed because we would rather listen to the elevator than to another couple. We found the staff very pleasant, but we don't use them for much because we don't find any staff to be all that helpful and would rather just do it ourselves. We did ask for a few restaurant suggestions (which were great). We also asked them if they maps of Napa (we went tasting one day) and they did. We already knew where we wanted to go, so didn't need them to plan anything.One thing I think is important to mention is this hotel is on the tippy top of Nob Hill. We are fit people and did not mind the huff and puff up the hill every day. However, if you have elderly or injured as part of your party, I would suggest a different hotel.	
May 22 2009 	Skeptical but Pleasantly Surpised	Like many of you, I read reviews from time to time and wonder if they're real or simply hype. My fascination with the Mark Hopkins dates back to the movie &quot;Bullitt.&quot; When I found out I'd be traveling to San Francisco on business, I decided to stay at the hotel. But would the good reviews hold up?I checked into the hotel around 11 p.m. on a Friday night. I had booked a King Bed Room on the Executive Club Floor. I called earlier in the day to inform the hotel I would be arriving late. I was dealt with promptly and professionally during the call. Upon my arrival, I drove directly into the small parking area off of California and Mason St. A valet attendant helped me with my bags and I was on my way.I was greeted by a friendly attendant at the front desk. He had good news for me. I had been upgraded to a Deluxe Terrace Suite. The entire transaction took less than 5 minutes. Then we were on our way to our room on the 15th floor.First things first, this is a historic hotel and its old. But get this. The place is by no means run down. As we entered our room, we found a nice couch, computer desk, television, and fax machine in one room. There was a separate dining room along with an enclosed terrace room that provided AMAZING views of San Francisco. Then, off of the dining room is the large bathroom (with hot tub style bath) and a large bedroom with a reading chair and table.On a scale of 1-10, I rank the size of this suite an 8. It was a perfect size. It felt like an apartment. As for amenities, I'd give it another 8. The suite included a hairdryer, shaving kit, bath robes, even turn down service each night. Best of all, the suite was elegant in design.Now for the negatives. As others have reported, you can definitely hear the noise from the street below. This was more apparent late at night than in the day. I could hear car alarms going off, the cable car going down the street, even loud conversations 15 floors below. And yes, when people shut the doors to their hotel rooms, you can hear it in your room. As for noise from neighbors, this was not a problem for me. I could hear people talking in the hallway at night, but noise from neighboring rooms was not an issue. The only other downer is parking. Valet parking is expensive, but in a town with few parking spots, it's expected.As for room service, it was fast, the people were friendly, and the food was good. Unfortunately they stop service each night at 11 p.m. Of course, if you stay here I recommend having a few drinks at Top of the Mark. I did just before sunset on Saturday evening. What a view! You can see the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. The place was a bit crowded, and yes, the people at the reception desk for a bit snooty, but the place is worth a visit. And our waiter was great. My favorite drink was the Snow Cone Martini followed by Jack in Manhattan.In all, I really enjoyed my visit at the Mark Hopkins. The suite was amazing and the views were PERFECT. It made up for the street noise and the noise in the hallways. I'd definitely stay there again. Of course, I'd opt for a suite with a view if you really want to experience this hotel at its best.	
Jun 23 2008	Nice hotel - very efficient	I stayed at this hotel June 18-22 for a conference and I have to say it was very well organized, clean and the staff were helpful and nice and the check in and check out were both very efficient.I would stay here again, it is walking distance to Union Square, on the main road for the trolley and close to china town and you can easily get around.One thing I really liked is that on the card holder for your room key, there's a little map with common directions and a little map on the other site to help you locate the main places to visit and I used it quite often.It's a very popular hotel for weddings, conferences and just tourists in general and seemed very well managed.	
Nov 2 2008 	Truly a wonderful Hotel	My partner and I came to this hotel for our marriage ceremony and were comepletely suprised at how beautiful the hotel was. Everything in our room was perfect. The staff, the pool, everything.Thank you Intercontinental!	
May 22 2009 	Courtyard By Marriott on Steroids	This hotel must be going bankrupt based on staff comments - I arrived late in the evening (around 10:30pm) but figured a JW Marriott would have room service to get a light dinner. Wrong! Operator told me they cut room service &quot;because they couldn't afford it during these difficult economic times.&quot; Later I called the concierge a couple times, leaving messages - still waiting for a call back. Probably cut that service during these difficult times. There was a button in my room for butler service - pushed and left pushed and never heard from the butler. Probably cut that service during these difficult times.The good - good location near Union Square. If you don't know SF, the area is a little gritty at night should you walk in the wrong direction but you are a block from Union Square and all the shopping and restaurants. Also, the rooms are quite spacious and well appointed in that Marriott instituational quality. This is not a bad hotel but don't pay a premium for it - as a long time Marriott customer, the only difference between this hotel and a Courtyard is that they had a lobby bar and restaurant. Of course, there are some Courtyards with lobby bars and restaurants so maybe there was no difference. Again, don't pay a premium for this hotel but feel comfortable there if you find a cheap rate.	
Apr 14 2009 	Taken a turn for the worse	This hotel became a JW Marriott @ 2 years ago. New owners then 'remodeled' the bathroom by removing the TVs and tub showerheads. Gee, usually a remodel involves improvement. Also removed most of the dresser drawers to install a mini-bar (note says that you will be charged if an item is removed for more than 15 seconds, or if you store items in the mini-bar). Had to live out of the suitcases. Ice bucket was dirty, and ice machines are not available to guests. Must request ice be brought to the room. Few towels provided, and they did not look fresh. One of the highest internet rates I've seen - $6.95 for 15 minutes. Another card in the room stated that guests will be charged $250 if the room smells of smoke. Room service costs definitely on the high end. Rooms/charges not at all family friendly.	
Oct 30 2007	Wonderful hotel!	I stayed here for a big conference on 10/26- 10/29 and was very impressed with the hotel. I paid $239 for a king bed through the conference. When I got there, I tried for a free upgrade but was granted only a &quot;remodeled&quot; room. However, as it turned out, it was wonderful. I will now review by category.Hotel: For those that don't know, this used to be the Pan Pacific hotel. It is located about 1 block from Union Square and is within walking distance to many nice restaurants and shops. You do need to take the elevator to the lobby.Room: I ended up with a remodeled &quot;corner&quot; room on the 10th floor. It was a wonderful looking room and was more spacious than most. I have never stayed in this hotel and don't know what to expect from the other rooms, but I was really happy with it. The bathroom was nice but only offered a shower. The bed was wonderful and had a down pillow top thingy over the mattress that made it wonderful. It had a big plasma TV and desk with a very very comfortable chair. I sat in that chair all the time. My room had two closes and a bar area as well. There looked to be a place for a fridge, but no fridge was found. Service: Very nice. I was there for 4 days and only opened the front door of the hotel a couple of times. There were always people there to do it and call a cab as well. The butler service was interesting and I only used it for a bucket of ice. There was nightly turn down service that would also fill up the ice bucket. My only complaint was that there were only 4 elevators in the whole hotel and sometimes required a short wait. All in all, it was a wonderful stay. Would definately return in the future.	
Mar 2 2007	Great Location Nice Hotel	The King George bills themselves as a &quot;European&quot; style hotel, which means small rooms. This is OK with us, since we use a hotel mostly for sleeping, and everything else about the hotel was fine or better -- clean rooms, well maintained property, very helpful staff (especially the concierge), good prices for breakfast, and more. The best feature, though, has to be their location: very near Union Square, and walking distance to many of SF's best attractions. We've stayed here before, will do so again.	
Aug 12 2006 	Geat Base!	We stayed at the Cartwright for 3 nights this was our first stop, and my first time to America!Hotel was nice and clean and everyone put themselves out of the way for us. We didnt realise till the 2nd day that you can have a free breakfast- so make sure you take advantag of that. Also they had wine tasting every afternoon from 5pm with homemade warm cookies! (Only found this out on the 2nd day too!). I agree the rooms were quite small but I loved the way they had been decorated and they were very clean. We spent alot of time in Fishermans Wharf and if we were to go back we would pobably like to stay in that area. The only downside was waking up every morning really early to the sound of street cleaners and cars. All in all it was a great hotel.	
Oct 7 2008 	Fawlty Towers does not compare!	Terrible experience, arrived at 1:30, smelly and musty reception area, the man at the desk started to process our details and then said the room would be ready between 3 and 4 o clock, went for a walk and then arrived back at 3:45. Other people starting to arrive back for get key cards to rooms but they still were not ready. The reception man was slow, and went through a map of the area with everyone even when there was a q which further dealayed the check in process. Said he would check and see if our rooms were ready then and went off up the stairs with us waiting 5 minutes for him to come back. Our room was still not ready but he started on about payement then. Because we had booked on hotels.com and had no triple A card we were not eligible to any discount!! Due to a convention on in town that week we had to stay at the hotel for the 3 nights as there was no other place available. Finally got into our room at 6 o clock after a lesson in how to use the lift!! The Superior Room with a City View and continental breakfast turned out to be average sized room, with homeless people shouting outside the window at night and breakfast was tea and a banana passed out over the reception desk. The only positive was the bathroom was clean but the smell of cleaning products and bleach every day was very strong. Would not recommend this hotel.	
Sep 29 2008 	Too expensive for what you get	We stayed at the hotel with a crew of 4 people. Overall the hotel is a nice place and has clean rooms. In addition, it is located in a good area close to Union square, right where we wanted to stay. However, for what you get in return the hotel is absolutely not worth the money we spent for those rooms. The service could be good if you could understand what the poor man was saying, and if he could somewhat understand what you are saying. I have stayed at quite a few hotels but never have I had the problems when checking in and out from this hotel. The check in took app. 30 minutes, which is a lot when the only only thing you want is to go to you rooms and rest. Also, the night before we were supposed to check out the man stopped us and wanted us to pay for our room because the person who were supposed to work in the morning didn´t know how to charge a credit card. (This was at 1am). The breakfast, which you are suppose to get in the morning, is joke. When we reserved the rooms the guy told us that breakfast was included. What you get is a dry piece of biscuit covered in plastic (looks about 5 years old) and a coffe.To sum it all up. Nice-clean rooms, horrible serivce and staff that does not belong in a hotel. With the US$150/night + taxes you can get a way better hotel than this. Even though they say that breakfast is included you will still need to buy breakfast somewhere else, which is another cost. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, unless there are no other rooms available in the city...then maybe.	
Jan 1 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel; the staff was extremely friendly and helpful along with a great location just two blocks from the Wharf and China Town. The room was clean and the bedding was first class. I would definitely stay there again.	
Aug 15 2009 	We would stay their again for the views.	We would recommend this hotel for business or couples but not for families. The rooms are exceptionally clean and include all amenities. The bathrooms are spacious with bathtub and showers. Make sure to book a room with a bay view. The breakfast is a-la-carte and not a buffet breakfast, so everything you order is prepared fresh. Overall a very pleasant experience.	
Aug 1 2006 	More than just a great view!	The Mandarin Oriental is a lovely, class act in the heart of San Francisco's financial district, where most other hotels are thoroughly dull. Since the hotel occupies the top floors of one of the tallest skyscrapers in town, a principal selling point is the stunning view [it is a bit bizarre to find oneself looking DOWN at the facade of Grace Cathedral atop nearby Nob Hill]. One advantage to the elevation is blessed silence, not a virtue to be taken lightly in San Francisco: at the Mandarin Oriental, you don't need to worry about cable cars rumbling past your window, or garbage trucks groaning up San Francisco's steep hills.We stayed in a Mandarin King. These are spacious, comfortable and beautifully decorated; with plenty of room for the roll-away for our daughter. The bathrooms are enormous, with tubs next to the windows, so you bathe with a view. Service is impeccable. A butler delivered soft drinks for my wife and me, and milk and cookies for our daughter, minutes after we checked in, and gratis. When I asked for directions to Restaurant Gary Danko, near Ghirardelli Square, the concierge arranged for transportation in the hotel's complimentary chauffered car. Breakfast, which came with the &quot;seasonal choices&quot; package, was served in the restaurant downstairs (we could also have arranged room service), and was excellent.We are relatively old fashioned, and usually opt for smaller, boutique hotels in San Francisco. But for our detour into highrise modernity, the Mandarin Oriental was most impressive. The MO is a superb hotel in every respect.	
Nov 14 2005	A great find!	I found the Marina Inn to be very charming. We were in room 212 right in the front. It was very cute, had two big bay windows with window seats. Since we were right in the front, there was a lot of noise from traffic, but it was not too bad and I had already read other reviews warning me of such.The room was very clean and the staff was wonderful and friendly. They recommended some great restaurants that were within walking distance. We felt very safe in the neighborhood. They do not have any parking, but there are many lots down the street. We paid $10 for overnight parking a few blocks away.Breakfast was good: muffins, bagels, juice. Nothing extrodinary, but definatley above average. The only downside was that some of the room features needed to be updated. The thermostat was missing from its spot on the wall, and the drain stoppers in the tub and in the sink were broken.All in all, I think this was a very good value and I would definatley stay again.	
Dec 7 2008 	Okay for the price	I found this motel via the internet-it was our third trip to SF and we decided to try something different than our first stay, which was in the financial district (second visit was a one day trip). The website was very well written and the photos were very enchanting. We were a bit disappointed upon our arrival. Not having much knowledge of the area, we did not realize the motel is right on a main thoroughfare; very busy with traffic. The pictures on the website and the customer reviews create this image of a motel nestled in a quiet corner of the Marina district, but this is not true. The room was quite small but okay for the two of us. We were right next to a room which allowed pets and the walls were very thin, so we heard the dogs barking for 5 hours straight one night because they left them unattended in their room. We almost called management but it was our last night, so we didn't make a big deal about it. Also, we could hear the neighbors coming in and out each and every time. The room was clean but they had a very old style heater in the room and it only heated the top half of the room. So, when we were on the bed watching tv, we would be cold but when we stood up, it would be toasty warm. It was okay for the duration of our visit and for the price, well, we got what we paid for, in our opinion. The website and the pictures are in a way, deceiving because there are no cobblestones in the courtyard and it wasn't really a quiet stay. I think if they included a picture of their neon lit sign, which is conveniently left out of the pictures on the website, people wouldn't be so quick to fall in love with the place; sight unseen.	
Feb 21 2006	Great Location	My husband and I just returned from a 3 day trip to San Francisco. We stayed at the Marriott at Fisherman's Wharf for the whole trip and loved it! The location was great! I'd been to San Francisco before and knew renting a car was a bad idea (minimal parking and &gt;$30/night to park at hotel) so staying at a hotel convenient to the sights was key. We requested a non-smoking king room, but were informed they couldn't guarantee the king part When we arrived all they had left were rooms with 2 doubles, but I believe it is a non smoking hotel, which was really nice. The beds were VERY comfortable. Down pillows and comforters, room darkening shades - all key for a good night sleep after a day of touring. I wasn't expecting much of a &quot;view&quot; from our 4th floor room, but surprisingly we could see the bay and golden gate bridge. The starbucks coffee in the room was nice. I heard the hotel restaurant was good, but we only got a couple pieces of fruit from the breakfast buffet. Which cost us $3.50 - ouch. The hotel concierge was very helpful. We spoke with him every day and he gave great advice and plenty of maps of the city and wine country.Overall, staying at this hotel really helped to make our stay in San Francisco memorable due to the convenient location to Fisherman's Wharf, restaurants, Lombard Street, Ghiradelli - walking distance to EVERYTHING!	
Feb 23 2005	Good hotel/facilities	Stayed for one night. Good location. Very comfortable room, good gym facility. Sauna did not have a shower or plunge pool therefore of limited use.	
Aug 3 2007	A really enjoyable stay	I believe some reviewers here must be hunting down the best prices in town and then comparing the accomodation to the Hilton. DUH. We were looking for a hotel with private rooms for as cheap as possible in San Francisco, as we were on a really tight budget, and it was a really last minute booking, so we were kinda asking the impossible.When I first found Mithila it was booked up, but after a few more hours of unsuccessful searching I found a cancellation on [--], so took it straight away.Arriving late at night, tired and with heavy backpacks and bags, we rang the bell and a guy came straight out, welcomed us and got all our luggage up the narrow stairs to reception.Here the guy was very welcoming and helpful, gave us a city map, explained transport options and told us to ring the bell anytime if we needed anything.Ourn room was a pleasant surprise, and far better than we expected at this price. NOT the Hilton, but a decent size, very clean ensuite bathroom with clean towels, fresh toiletries and abundant hot water. There was TV (though not an inspiring channel selection) and fridge, iron/ironing board and hair dryer, all clean.The building itself is, as described, an older continental style hotel - rather faded, but certainly comfortable and clean. Finally, we just couldn't believe how well located the hotel is. Union Square and Chinatown easy walking distance. Plenty of theatres. Close to many transport options, yet at night the district is really quiet, so you don't have to wear earplugs to block out traffic noise. The only noise problem we had was from 2 German girls staying in the next room on one night, who wrre apparently unaware that they were not the only people in the building, but this is not the fault of the hotel.I couldn't find any better rates in SF unless you wanna stay out of town, or in a hostel. For me the Mithila is excellent value, and if we return to SF I will happily book here again.	
Jan 15 2006 	awful	You have to carry your luggage up a long flight of stairs. The hotel was locked. We waited outside for ten minutes ringing the buzzer. We were finally buzzed in. At the counter the check-in person there in pyjamas proceeded to argue with us for 20 minutes over the price we booked online.The room was DISGUSTING. filthy carpet, ratty furniture. But even worse was the smell - like mold everywhere. The next day I could still smell the musty smell from the night before. We checked out early the next morning and the staff argued with us some more about the rate we paid until we paid them more. If I had more time I would have reported them to the BBB.The &quot;breakfast&quot; was a complete joke. A tray of plastic wrapped junk pastries and coffee. They had a whole stack of the plastic wrapped pastries behind their desk. A HORRIBLE HOTEL - AVOID AVOID AVOID. There are much better values in San Francisco. Even if you have to pay $20 more - DO IT! This is not the &quot;charming&quot; hotel they advertise.	
Jan 29 2007	Excellent Location	My husband and I stayed at this motel at the end of December. The owners absolutely made our trip. We had never been to San Francisco before and were provided with a map and all the necessary information to eat at the best places, buy bus tickets, where is safe, etc...The room was very clean and huge! It was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. One note, if your vehicle is tall (Thule Box), you may have a problem parking there and in San Francisco, you don't need your car, just take the bus! This problem was easily solved with a parking garage around the corner for $7.00 per day. Also, if you want to see Alcatraz book before you get there! I would recommend this motel to everyone!	
Apr 26 2005	Great bargain great location	This is the perfect little motel for people who are more interested in seeing the city than the inside of their hotel room. The parking is free. The rooms are clean. I slept great -- no excess noise from the street. There's a microwave and refrigerator in the room so you can store your snacks and have a few meals in if you want. The desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The location is actually Russian Hill between Polk and Van Ness on Pacific Ave. Walking distance up to Ghirardelli Square and the cable cars. We loved it.	
May 8 2004	A pleasant and comfortable stay at the Nob Hill Motor Inn	My wife and I went to San Francisco for the weekend and Nob Hill was a great choice to stay. The friendly staff made us feel comfortable and they were very accomidating to our needs. Our room was very clean and spacious. The location of the hotel was perfect. In walking distance of many great attractions in San Francisco. We enjoyed our stay very much and recommend the Nob Hill Motor Inn to anyone that wants to experience an enjoyable stay in San Francisco.	
Oct 12 2008 	Excelente Estadia !		
Jun 3 2009 	Loved this motel!	Our son was graduating from SFSU and we chose the Ocean Park as it is about 3 miles to his place and less than that to campus. Lovely grounds and cozy rooms made this a great choice for our SF visit. The muni to downtown goes right by, so you can hop on and be downtown in about 20 minutes. Not luxury accomodations by any means, but clean and a throwback to the old days of lodging. Try it if you have no desire to be in the tourist areas of SF.	
Nov 21 2004	A basic hotel in a good location	If you are looking for a cheap place to stay, then the Olympic hotel is great! The hotel is in a central location and not once did I feel threatened. The room itself was small and very dated, but it was clean and we had hot water every morning. We had a private bathroom and this was worth the extra money as the shared bathrooms looked horrible. The staff were also very friendly. The only problem was the lack of plugs! I am certain that the plug sockets have never been changed and they looked very unsafe so I ended up having to dry my hair in the hallway which was a pain. If I returned to San Francisco, I don't think I would stay at the Olympic, but this is only because I would prefer to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area- the restaurants and the views of the Golden Gate Bridge there are fantastic.	
Jun 16 2009	The Omni has it all.	I recently got back from a trip through California with my mom. At the end of our trip we stayed 3 nights at the Omni. It was the BEST of all the hotels we stayed at and I feel I booked some nice hotels. There was always a doorman and Darryl is the best of ALL. They were polite and would say welcome back. Darryl would even ask how your outing was. The front desk always said hello to me and my mom as we descended the stairs in the lobby. The room was clean and comfortable. The bath was very nice indeed. The room service was excellent in taste and value. My mom liked the tea they used so much I had to go online to order some for her. I personally loved the blueberry muffins with honey. Some people might say $4 plus tax and gratuity is expensive but go try to buy one at another establishment. It would cost about the same and is not near the quality or quantity. I have traveled coast to coast about 45 times and abroad twice, some was business and some pleasure. Some of the hotel/motels cost $40 a night and some $500. In those stays I have NEVER encountered the service as I did at the Omni San Francisco.I even took mom inside 3 big name hotels at the Wharf to compare our value and we knew we had made the right decision immediately. None of the hotels had a doorman available, the concierge was either aloof or rude (and yes I asked for 'directions'), and no one said hello as we entered. Also, when we left, I noticed there was no one to call a cab.I will say that we got spoiled on a refrigerator to store goodies in along our trip - as the Omni has items stored in theirs to buy, but it is overall TRIVIAL and I can't see myself staying anywhere else the next time I visit San Francisco.Lastly, yYou must try Bob's Chop House in the hotel. My mom had the Halibut which she said was better than a leading restaurant we ate at the night before. I had the crab cakes. They were excellent and I must say that the scallop potatoes with onions and peppercorn gravy served with a huge glazed carrot was superb.Thanks for a wonderful stay. My mom said it was her highlight hotel.	
Aug 13 2007 	Fantastic !!!	We just returned from a long weekend visit to San Francisco celebrating our 36th wedding anniversary and stayed at the Omni. The room was beautiful and impeccably clean. The service and accommodations were wonderful. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Since it was our anniversary, the maid had arranged towels in the shape of a heart with a nice little heart shaped note beside it. Our concierge Vida Lau at check-in congratulated us on our anniversary and said that something would be sent up to us later. Well, upon our return after a little walk in China Town there was a small bottle of champagne &quot;chilled&quot; with glasses along with some chocolate covered strawberries. And Vida had sent along a little note. Whenever we wanted to take a tour or ask about transportation either the doorman or the concierge were so very helpful. We had our breakfasts and one dinner at Bob's restaurant there and the meals were wonderful and so was the service. My husbnad and I agree that this by far was not only one of our favorite vacations but these were the best accommodations and service that we have EVER had at a hotel.	
May 13 2009	Great value great location great staff!	My grown daughter and I stayed at the Orchard Garden for several nights in Feb and were very pleased with our accommodations. The location coudn't have been better for touring the city and the staff was extremely helpful. Our room could only have been made better by the addition of a fridge and maybe a microwave...otherwise it lacked nothing. We will definitely plan on staying there again on our next trip to San Fran!	
Nov 3 2008 	No Honeymooners allowed!!!	After reading so many fantastic reviews about the Orchard Garden Hotel, my husband and I decided to stay there on our honeymoon. With a cost of $400 per night for the terrace suite (thats WITH a discount of $100 per night), we were excited to see what our splurge afforded us. Upon walking into the hotel, I was like.this is it? The entrance is neither grand nor inviting. My husband inquired about the morning breakfast and the staff suggested we eat somewhere else because the food was overpriced and not really all that good. Our terrace suite was utterly disappointing. The room is tiny. The balcony is shared with the room next door. The bathroom is large with separate shower and tub but the towel rack and soap dish both fell apart. The batteries were dead in the remote and even after informing the front desk, none were sent up. We had originally booked to stay for four nights, but after a few hours, we decided to change hotels for the remainder of our stay. We spoke with a gentleman at the front desk and he had no reaction to our concerns or our wanting to cancel our reservations. In fact, he even suggested that we stay at the hotel across the street where he used to work. For our honeymoonANY honeymoon or romantic weekend, I would say definitely find a different hotel. However, I think this would be a nice hotel to stay in on a business trip. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom shower products were lovely. We loved the robes although Im not sure if they have them in every room. Very peaceful but not at all romantic.	
Aug 16 2008 	Great stay	We enjoyed our two-night stay at the Orchard Garden. Our room was large and quiet. All the amenities were perfect, and we liked the fact that it was a green hotel. The breakfast was a special treat. Billed as a European-style breakfast, it includes cereals, breads, fruits, meats, cheeses, and hard-boiled eggs--just what we needed to start our day. We would stay at this hotel again.	
Jul 5 2008 	Perfect hotel - the best!	Clean, beautiful, classy. In San Francisco, a great deal too. We paid $204 per night (AAA) excluding tax, for a room with 2 double beds. Non-smoking, eco-friendly, CLEAN, small rooms (but typical size for the city). We had a 2nd floor room on the Bush Street side, and I cannot believe how quiet it was - almost weird how sound-proof the windows were. Very comfortable beds too. Be sure to grab Starbucks (across the street, on both corners) and take it to the roof-top garden in the morning. Visit the bar in the hotel restaurant (Roots) and have a fantastic free appetizer (garlic fries) during happy hour (4:30-7:00 p.m.). Avoid the pseudo-french cafe directly across the street though - $$$, so-so food, and poor service.Close to Chinatown, Union Square, North Beach, cable cars, BART, Embarcadero, etc. We ate in North Beach every night (walked) and had outstanding meals (try Franchino's) and really great gelato. The walk to North Beach from the Orchard is about 15-20 minutes (Bush to Kearney to Columbus) or about a $5 cab fare.Recommend the evening tour of Alcatraz too - even if you've been on the standard day tour, check out the evening version...special presentations, less crowded, city lights - it's awesome! HornBlower on Pier 33 is the only way to go ($30 per ticket) - and about $6 cab fare.Walk the Bay Area Ridge Trail through the Presidio (free). A great urban trail that winds through forested and historic sections of the park, and culminates with amazing ocean views from the battery bluffs, and a trip across the Golden Gate bridge. Total out-and-back round trip from the Arguello Gate, including across the bridge is about 8 miles, so plan on a 4 hour walk if your fit...and if you're not fit, go anyway. Cab fare from the Orchard to the Arguello Gate is about $8.The Orchard Garden staff is extremely polite, friendly, and helpful. If you need a cab, directions, or anything at all, they'll help. We're a very discerning family, and my travel goal is to find the cleanest places at the best prices - so I don't just throw praise around casually. You won't be disappointed here unless you want to stay where you smell churros from Pier 39 all night.	
Sep 15 2009 	Practically lived in this hotel	While working for a consulting firm in San Francisco, I would stay at the Palace during the work week for almost a full year. The hotel was always very clean, the staff is very helpful, the room service is fantastic, and the dining area is very elegant and the food is fabulous. I had my choice of hotels and I picked this one because it gave me everything I needed and even though my company was paying for it, the prices are in-line or even a bit less than other hotels in the area. There is a reason that this hotel has been around for 100 years.	
Mar 2 2009 	Beautiful lobby	Rooms so, so. Best to upgrade to Market Street view...worth the price.Avoid eating and drinking here...way too expensive.	
Jul 23 2007 	Nice Hotel just a bit boring	I returned to the Palace for a long business trip this July, the hotel is nice, its just not very exciting. The room I had was decent and the bed was very comfortable. The room faced Market, this became a problem several days into my trip, as construction started late at night. The front desk assisted me with a room change. The second room I received, inner room, was really dark and small. It would have been a bummer to have stayed in that room for seven nights; however, it was quiet and I was only in the room for two nights. The photos in the review are of the first room facing Market. The gym is average to below average. The cardio equipment is really old. The pool area is nice. As for the concierge, two of the female staff members were really rude. One gentleman who worked the concierge desk gave some great advice... however, stay away from the female staff. They were mean, rude, and never smiled once. If you like old grand hotels and you intend to spend a fair amount of time in the lobby, this is the place for you. If you want a flat screen TV, free internet service in the lobby, nice cardio equipment, or a friendly concierge... go elsewhere. Its nice, its just not great. I would only stay here again for my starwood points... but the W is down the street as well as the new Westin!	
Apr 18 2007 	An Average Luxury Hotel	It would be a real stretch to call this a luxury hotel. The relatively spacious rooms (we had a deluxe) are dated, with small bathrooms, old mattresses, and old CRT televisions. Starwood is going to have sink some money into the rooms here to truly make this a luxury accomodation.In contrast to the rooms, the public spaces are grand. The Garden Court is one of the more beautiful spaces in the city, and the entire main floor has that sort of turn-of-the-century glamor. It's unfortunate that this sense of design doesn't carry upstairs.The pool looked nice, though we did not get a chance to use it. This is certainly a major positive of this property. The gym was serviceable--service in he gym was quite good. They brought us towels and bottled water before we began our work-out.The hotel is in a good location--it's a five minute walk to Union Square and SFMoma, and a 15 minute walk down Market to the Ferry Building. This hotel is definitely not a bad place to stay, but for the money, and because it is a member of the so-called Luxury Collection, the rooms should much, much nicer.	
Jul 7 2005 	Restful room Elegant lobby	Palace Hotel San Francisco. We found the rooms to be quite pleasant. Extremely comfortable bed, 14 foot ceilings, 13 feet high drapes, elegant bathroom with marble accents. Complimentary terry robes in room, side chair with ottoman. The 4th floor indoor pool was a treat. Free coffee at the pool (until 10 am) with fruit and complimentary bottled water. Each day we were greeted at poolside with a sincere &quot;welcome&quot; by their great staff. Garden Court Restaurant and public spaces very elegant. We did notice some flaws in the hotel, such as somewhat beat-up furniture, and a spot or two on the bed ruffle, and worn lobby furniture, and a nick or a dent here or there. Perhaps a hotel in the &quot;Luxury Collection&quot; should preclude any blemishes like this, but it certainly didn't detract from our enjoyment. Montgomery BART station at the door. Close to cable cars, Chinatown, and Union Square. ALso- for those who are aware of the terrible homeless problem in San Franciso, the Palace, on Montgomery Street, is a few blocks west of the main concentration of street folk.	
Feb 14 2005	best combination of quality and convenience in the city	I have stayed at the Palace multiple times, and each time I have found it to be perfectly fine. The location is by far the best of any hotel in San Francisco, on Market Street right next to the Montgomery BART station. My room was quiet, comfortable, clean, and perfectly big enough. The shower is excellent. The lobby is cool. There are free newspapers. The people were all fine. And it was all remarkably cheap, booked through Expedia.The only glitch I experienced was that the electrical power shut down in that part of San Francisco (the whole neighborhood, not just the hotel) for quite a few hours one evening and most of the night. For a while the elevators weren't operating and I had to climb the stairs. As far as I was concerned the hotel dealt with this fine. For example they handed out glowsticks.	
Aug 6 2009 	Muy centrico bien de precio aunque con cucarachas en el baño		
Nov 18 2008 	Wonderful stay	We stayed at the Petite Auberge from October 27 to 30th this year and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is queit, ciomfortable, and the staff are extremely helpful. We had a king-size bed, and a fireplace, and both were welcoming after a long flight from Ireland. We arrived tired and it was great to feel welcomed and to be offered hospitability without any sense of being stinted. The hotel supplies freshly baked cookies on arrival, there is a coffee maker in the room, and there is a compolimentary wine reception in the evenings which is a great way of making friends with other guests if this is what you want. Breakrfasts, also complimentary, were substantial, with porridge, a cooked dish, and lovely fresh bakery products available. Any help needed was supplied by the friendly staff at the front desk. Rooms on the side of the second floor are quiet. The decor is a nicely judged French Provencal style, and fits in with the calm atmosphere. The lcoatuion is excellent too - a few mintues walk brings you to Union Square and the theatre district.	
Sep 22 2007 	The Best small hotel in San Fran	A great location for Union Square and Chinatown. Also, for transportaion to Fisherman's Wharf (15-minute ride). Hotel is very clean and people friendly. The complimentary wine every nite is a great place to talk with other visitors and the bottled water to take on your excursions each day was great!! Would stay here next visit to San Fran	
May 3 2007 	terrible	I though this hotel was terrible that was my first reaction and rude staff to boot. We arrive 5 minutes early and the receptionist was very offish.Matters not helped by our month old booking not being found even though it was through Hotels.com.(which is a huge company).So we were given the last room available which if you've traveled much means the worst room and that was next to the lift.The room was noisy and had a dreadful view of the run down building next door which was only 5m away, this creates a terrible view.Also if you are an asthmatic do not book this hotel as chintzy in this case means old and I became very unwell.I've included photos and the cupboard without the doors inlaid with that TV that you cant watch from bed is a nice touch.Ive traveled a great deal and this is a hotel living off old reviews.The only saving grace was the home made food, good cakes and the staff in the morning being very helpful but that is not enough for me to recommend this hotel.	
Sep 14 2005	great hotel for romantic get-away	My girlfriend and I were in town for a wedding in Hayward CA. We had to stay close to the wedding site for a couple of days but had a chance after the wedding to go into San Francisco for a little mini-getaway. This was a first time using a recommendation from tripadvisor and we were absolutely thrilled. The hotel was just like most of the reviews have mentioned. It is a small boutique-style hotel with a great location truly just a very short walk to Union Square, Chinatown, and Cable Cars. It has a VERY European feel to it with very small rooms and bathrooms but what it doesn't have in space, it makes up for in spades with atmosphere.It is more like a bed&amp;breakfast than a hotel with books and magazines in the room, free umbrella rentals, and a very helpful staff. We didn't have time to try the free wine-tasting happy hour but we had the free breakfast for two mornings (one at the beginning of the breakfast hours and one at the very end) and was delicious and fresh each time. It was a very romantic hotel and we were so satisfied with the recommendation that we will use tripadvisor to plan all of our up-coming trips.	
Oct 14 2007 	The Phoenix offers something you won't find elsewhere	It has now been five months since we stayed at the Phoenix Hotel. If you are wondering if you will like the place, the information in the reviews here, when taken as a whole, presents a great picture. What is said about the neighborhood is true -- it's gritty. If you are from suburban USA or abroad you might find the down-and-out folks who frequent the area frightening. If you are from a big city, anywhere, you will probably be sufficiently inured to the realities of poverty and street living that you will witness. My teenaged daughter and I navigated the area with no incidents. We did not tempt fate by venturing out late at night.It is true that the hotel itself is not the Ritz. It is more like a Motel 6 done up by a decorator who specializes in garage sale chic. Funky is an apt term, and proudly so. The furnishings are not top of the line, but they function just fine. The beds were great. The bathroom was adequate, just, but very clean. There is a curtain instead of a door on the closet. The TV is average size. There is no AC (but lots of jalousie windows and a ceiling fan). The front desk is staffed by a very young and hip group with piercings, fashion hair styles and rock star clothing. They were all friendly, but none would pass muster at a four or five star place. Expecting the expertise of a four or five star hotel staff would be unfair. On the other hand, their enthusiasm and verve makes up for polish. We asked about bus routes and the staff bent over backwards to find us maps and explain the best ways to get around. And, their advice was flawless.We were not there on a weekend so I cannot address the noise issue. The Bambudda restaurant shares the hotel's patio space. One of my favorite comments from a reviewer here was about the surreal scene of urban hipsters dressed to the nines enjoying a date on the bar patio by the pool, whilst children who are guests of the hotel splash in the same pool. True, true. An experience for both.The gardens are the thing that would take me back to this hotel again and again. Opening your hotel door -- especially if you are on a ground floor room -- is a true California experience. Outside your room is a paradise of Pacific flora, from hibiscus and bouganvillia to banana trees. There are lawns, manicured walkways and little alcoves with benches where you can sit and read, or close your eyes and soak up the peace. You will forget that there is a city outside the garden gates. The garden is a haven for birds. Breakfast is set out by the pool each morning. Having a peaceful breakfast in the lush garden beats any hotel breakfast room in the city, in my opinion.City bus service is great. I highly recommend looking up routes for transportation ahead of time. We were able to get to the hotel by taking the BART from the airport to Civic Center, and walking a few blocks. Bus service comes within a block of the hotel. Also, I recommend that you join the Joie de Vivre guest program. The Hotel Bijou site has a link, I think, or at least their parent hotel site does. It is free, but &quot;buys&quot; you a nice little welcoming gift. We had bottled water and a chocolate waiting in the room, with a welcome card from the staff. Yeah, it made us feel special. :) This is a special hotel. If you read the reviews here, and think it sounds like the sort of place you'd like, you are probably right. Have a great trip!	
May 25 2007 	Hotel was pretty nice	Hotel is pretty good. We were surprized.Room was very large and clean.A little old, but location buys everything.Staff was very friendly.	
May 28 2007 	Wanted to love it but disappointed	We arrived in San Francisco after a long flight from Sydney, Australia. We got to the hotel at about 10am - we didn't expect our room to be ready, but we were rather surprised by the indifferent reception from the staff at the front desk. We were allowed to leave our luggage, but were told 'go for a walk' until 3pm. It would have been nice to be offered a drink, or even a map with advice on the best places to visit. Our room was small but quite well appointed - the bed was good. Our view was of airconditioning plants and rubbish, but we were in the room to sleep, not stare out the window. Unfortunately the indifferent service returned when we asked about tours to Alcatraz - we were advised that we should walk to the pier, which would take about 25minutes, and ask if tickets were available. The concierge advised us that she had rung earlier this morning for other guests, and there were only a few tickets left so we might be disappointed. We were quite annoyed that she didn't see fit to call on behalf of us. The final annoyance came when we needed to check out at 5.45 am - we took our bags downstairs to encouter a very friendly cleaner, but yet more indifference from the staff at the front desk. We had to interrupt their discussions about tiresome guests to ask if we could check out - the person we spoke to said he couldn't help and then just walked away. We assumed he was going to get someone who could, but he walked outside to chat to someone in the street. We stood there for about 15 minutes before someone else wandered by. The Prescott is in a great location - we wanted to love it, but the combination of the poor service and slightly shabby interiors made for a frustrating stay.	
Mar 28 2006	Great bang for the buck!	We got the hotel on priceline for $102 a night and it was more than worth it. From the concierge at check-in with bottled water to the wine in the evening was great! The room was a little small, but clean with a great bed- soft blankets, pillows and comfy. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions, restaurants recommendations, etc. In the lobby lounge there was coffee/tea every a.m., cookies on the concierge station, in the p.m. and 5-6 every evening red and white wine-complimentary for all guests. We are from NYC and for first time visitors to the San Fran we found this hotel to be in a great location for getting to most neighborhoods- especially if you like to walk. We would recommend it and hope to stay there again.	
Sep 8 2004	Great Hosts	A busy place but not too busy to answer your questions and try to meet your needs. The staff is great and the wine social hour is lots of fun meeting new people from all-over the world. A little spendy but you deserve it .	
Sep 30 2007 	Dirty Dirt Dirty	Too bad, we didn't read this forum before we booked the room. Everything that is written in this forum about Presidio Inn is true. We entered the room and were repelled. We choose to pay twice for a room that night... I had a looong discussion with the manager about the discrepancy between the advertisement on his website and the actual condition of the hotel. He didn't even see my point and claimed that every hotel manager is lying on the webpage. Unfortunately, motels like this make people consider only the big chains for future reservations.	
Aug 9 2008 	Loved location but small room	Stayed 4 nights ending tour of California with partner and 18 y/o and 15 y/o children. This was the last stop for us and although the location of this hotel is great for Fishermans Wharf, we found the room to be the smallest we encountered on the tour.Considering the amount we paid for this hotel compared with others on this trip, we expected more in terms of room size. There was also a wait every time for the lifts.If what you are looking for is a convenient location and somewhere to lay your head then this accomodation is more than adequate but make sure you use the &quot;Privacy&quot; card in your door - housekeeping seem to start extremely early.We were lucky in that our room faced onto the parking area so we were never really disturbed by the early morning street cleaning but we also found the beds to be rather uncomfortable even with the sleep number system (we tried every combination from 25 to 100 without finding one to suit).Overall we were happy with the location of this hotel but would have preffered something a little larger and somewhere with a guest laundry which we missed.	
Aug 16 2007 	I would stay elsewhere	I have to say, the mixed reviews on this hotel are warranted. I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years, and this one definately has some good points, like location. Granted, Fisherman's Wharf has some interesting people hanging around it, but no reason to feel unsafe in or around the hotel. Any big city has the same problems. The part I felt was very poor, was the staff at check in, terrible experience. I booked 3 rooms with BayView and they only had two when my group got there, which was very annoying given the amount of time the rooms were booked in advance of you stay. Only 1 clerk working, line of people waiting to check in, no management around to discuss the problem with. Overall, the hotel service was poor. The hotel decor is ok, sleep number beds were cool. Not worth the money they want for this hotel. Next time, I'd probably try the Sheraton across the street, or the Holiday Inn.	
Mar 12 2006	It's Fine!!	Stayed for 4 nights from 1st - 4th March. Our room, on the third floor, overlooked the car park but you could see the top of Coit Tower and the waterfront from it.Room had a huge bed and was fine, not the largest but quite adequate. Hotel was quiet and we slept well.It's position is fantastic, walk through the rear walkway and directly onto the wharf, short stroll to Pier 39, the f-line is almost outside and thr tram car stop if a five-ten minute walk away.Breakfast can be got at either McDonalds, Ihop or other small cafes within a short stroll.Staff were helpful and basically it all went well, I'd happily stay again.	
Jun 18 2007 	Not a bad place to stay	We stayed here one night using Marriott points. The beds were extremely comfortable but the room was smaller than the one we stayed in New York. The hotel is very dated but it is an older hotel in San Fran so it's to be expected. The staff was very friendly and held our luggage for us after we checked out so we could further explore the city. It is convenient to the cable car line as well. We stayed on the west side of the hotel which is not recommended because the garbage pickup is on that side. Luckily it was a Sunday so we didnt have to worry about it. We were glad we were able to use points to stay here because the 40 dollar parking fee is ridiculous and the $9.95 a day for the internet. All in all, we would not stay here again unless we were able to use points but the beds were great!	
Oct 5 2006 	Great Location	What a great Hotel in a great city. My wife and I arrived from the East Coast at 11 am and the front desk found us a room that had already been cleaned and was ready. That was great to since we had been up so early and needed a place to freshen up. The location is convenient to Chinatown and Union Square, just a couple of blocks each way. The trolley line has a stop right beside the Hotel and that makes it easy to get to all the tourist spots. A newspaper and coffee or tea in the morning is waiting at your door. The Hotel is very clean and the staff was very accommodating. The room was a little outdated, but the very plush and comfortable bed more that made up for that one flaw.	
Jan 31 2005	Great hotel and service	We stayed at the Renaissance Stanford Court for three nights in September 2004. The service was excellent and the staff members were all helpful and friendly. We loved the location, close to public transportation and also close enough to walk to several attractions. Our room was very comfortable, quiet and peaceful and we loved the little luxuries of turndown service and morning tea delivered to our door.On our next visit to San Francisco, we will definitely stay here again!	
Sep 10 2008	se volete una esperienza "forte" questo hotel fa per voi!		
Sep 29 2009 	Gute Lage aber viele Schwachpunkte...		
Aug 31 2008 	Central Location 	Summary: Nothing fancy, but a great value, especially if arriving by car.Pros: Helpful front desk; large, clean rooms (ours had fridge &amp; microwave-- but no supplies); central location on bus line; good restaurants nearby; free continental breakfast, wi-fi, and on-site parking.Cons:1) It's best to grab a parking spot when you get there, then walk/commute during your stay. The motel lot is small, and there was shattered safety glass on most nearby streets.... 2) If you don't like stairs, be prepared to wait. One very small, tired, elevator serves 4 floors and about 40 rooms.	
Jun 15 2008 	snobby hotel with a view	This hotel has all the amenities you'd expect, the sort of room you'd expect, etc etc, and a spectacular view (I stayed at the 25th floor looking directly out over Union Square and SoMa). The staff was less than helpful though, a very cool reception at check-in, not superbly attentive staff in the restaurant, and porters who only offered help with a heavy suitcase after I already had reached the doors. Definitely a cold and somewhat snobby impression of the staff - even although they did everything you'd need from hotel staff. I later stayed in the much cheaper Powell Hotel and got a ten times better treatment.	
Mar 10 2008 	We love Hotel 480! Highly Recommend!!	We just got back from a weekend in San Francisco (Union Square). I can't say enough about it. Other reviews before ours complained about renovations, but they must be completed now because we saw no signs of this. The rooms were clean and the staff always went out of there way to make us feel as if we were their only guests. The view from our room overlooking Union Square and the entire City was unbelievable. We sat at the bar late one night and received excellent service from Thomas a long time bartender there. The hotel is on the cable car line which gives you easy access to anywhere you want to go outside of Union Square. Everything else from restaraunts, night clubs, and all the shops are within easy walking distance. The conciere was so helpful with everything from trip planning to printing out our boarding passes for our return trip home. If you are looking for a room in the Union Square area, I highly recommend Hotel 480....soon to become a Marriot though.	
Aug 15 2005	Awesome!	Great last minute place to stay, ocean view and near alot of attractions. Very spacious inside, with a bit of romance by the fire place. I will absolutly stay there again...Oh and dont forget the resturant down stairs!	
Dec 7 2004	Just Perfect ...	If you are looking for something different than the regular old corporate hotel room in a busy, crowded, overpriced central business district ... try the Seal Rock.I was in SF on business recently and just did not want to stay downtown. I remembered the Seal Rock In and it was just perfect. The rooms were clean and comfortable ... although not at all fancy. The location is perfecrt. At the end of Geary Street off Golden Gate Park ... with an awsome view of the Pacific Ocean. I never heard any buses, but even if they would have been loud ... it would not have changed my opinion.. A big thumbs up!!!	
Aug 22 2009 	Character 	Good location since its near the cable rail lines &amp; Union Sqr, with all its major shopping attractions,down the street 2 or 3 blocks. Its much more interesting than staying down at the predictible wharf area with all the tourist milling about but its on the edge of the Tenderloin so ask your doorman for advice about the area. We walked everywhere with no problems. The place was clean,had unique charm,nice amenities &amp; honor bar. They have a happy hour in the lobby in the evenings, complimentary &amp; thats great to meet other guest &amp; get tips. Complimentary coffee in the mornings in lobby,a good strong brew. Had ice cream complimentary mid affternoon as well,but I was never there for that. Nice little gym, much more equipment than I expected &amp; a sauna. Comfortable beds,very plush after all day walking.	
Jan 7 2009 	Great Place Right in the City	When I booked the hotel, I really didnt know what to expect. I knew that in San Fransisco there is a street where if you are one side of the street your in the &quot;slums&quot; and if you are on the other your in &quot;glam&quot; part of town. Driving to the hotel was pretty scarey I must say because the area didnt look to safe. The hotel is about one block up from the block &quot;you shouldnt be on&quot;. It was such a comfort to have the valet waiting for us outside of the hotel and take our luggage and park the car. When we got our room it was clean, not stuffy (like most big hotels) and very spacious. The decor was beautifully done. The service was great, although they didnt have room service on New Years Day. The hotel was about 3 blocks away from Union Square right where all the shopping is. We had breakfast every morning at Max's Diner (Delicious!) and walked very easily into the center of town for some shopping. I was very pleased with our stay and would definitely reccoment it to anyone.P.S. They also have a floor that allows dogs!	
Oct 6 2008 	Wonderful more than I even expected experience at the Serrano	I recently returned from a 6 day stay at the Serrano and I have nothing but kind words for the entire staff. The doormen were a pleasant welcome coming back from a long day of traveling the city and the front desk staff and concierge were full of helpful dinner/city tips. Complimentary wine fit the experience and gave a great reason to mingle in the cozy lobby.The location of the hotel really couldn't have been better in my opinion. Taking the front desk's advice, take an EASY walk toward Market and you've got everything you need from shopping/transportation/restaurants at your disposal.As far as the rooms, we had to check in early due to the fact we were coming from another hotel (the Serrano didn't have availability our first night). The hotel manager, Antonio was more then accomodating and we were welcomed to a ready-room that was sparkling clean every night when we returned.I would highly recommend this hotel, have absolutely no complaints, and look forward to staying here again.	
Mar 20 2008 	Comfortable Room	Everything about this hotel was great, except for the food.Room wasn't large, but the bed was very comfortable and the shower was terrific. Bathroom is small but they've at least tried to make some counter space. Hotel was for quiet, except for the high pressure window spraying at 6:30 am. Lobby is beautiful. I checked in very late on a Sunday night, curb service was outstanding and front desk was efficient checking in (and out.)Only problems were food related: no coffee in room. The service at Ponzu restaurant for breakfast was actually hostile, although we were able to go out into the lobby for the free coffee and bring it back into the Ponzu to drink. Bar is fine in the evening but closes early. However there are other excellent restaurants nearby, and the Hilton across the street has a top-floor bar with an awesome view.	
Mar 15 2006	Loved The Serrano	We have just returned from San Francisco on Mar.13th.I just read the review from Mar. 5 and I want to say it says it all. The Serrano was well kept, quiet &amp; it was a great place to stay. All the staff was genuine &amp; helpful. It has the amenities as listed. I did put my cosmetic bag on the bathroom counter &amp; my husband kept his in the closet until he needed it. But it was a small inconvenience!! It is a wonderful place to stay, convenient to everything &amp; clean. We were in a room with 2 double beds &amp; it was fine. I would definitely recommend the hotel for anyone-single or families!!	
Jul 9 2008 	Not bad.	Good location, lovely renovated rooms. It was just too noisy. We had a room overlooking the drive, which had outdoor seating on it. They don't however close the outdoor seating area at night and so the noise continues. Ask for a room away from this and I couldn't fault this hotel. In room breakfast by the way not worth the money, although the service is very good.	
Mar 1 2008 	Fantastic	I would like to say that this hotel knows how to provide outstanding and professional service to families. The hotel staff went above and beyond to meet all our child's needs. The management also brought a microwave to the room to assist with heating babies bottles.The room was modern, clean, spacious and comfortable. Staff were always polite, professional and willing to go the 'extra mile'. The concierge prints requests within minutes and is fluent in many languages.Overall the hotel is in a fabulous location at Fisherman's Wharf, close to all local tourist attractions. I would recommend a stay here to anyone.	
Aug 30 2006 	Good 3-star tourist class hotel	This is a fine, but not remarkable hotel. It is not a 4-star luxury hotel (which is why I think some people are disappointed) but a good 3-star tourist hotel.The location is great for exploring the city, close to the cable car lines, most of the tourist ferries and the street car lines and walking distance to North Beach, Telegraph Hill, Russian Hill, Fishermans' Wharf and Chinatown.The rooms are nice, but standard hotel-motel rooms (except for the very nice beds) and the facilities are clean and adequate. The hotel staff was nice and the concierge was excellent. When we were there (August) the hotel was quite full with Italians, Germans, Brits and the French--even a Dane or two.I would avoid the pricey restr. and bar. There are plenty of nice alternatives nearby.Parking is too expensive and the lobby is bustling. The pool is small but heated and well-stocked with towels (which you will need as SF is ALWAYS cold.	
Jan 2 2005	Good location	I used price-line to get a very good rate on this hotel. The location is excellent. We walked to the wharf and beyond. I was first apprehensive because there were so many poor ratings of this hotel. When we first checked in we were told that there were no more non-smoking rooms. We were given the worst room in the hotel. Right next to the bellhop blowing his whistle all day, and the room stank. I complained very nicely and was given a room on the second floor that was bigger and didn't smell. I guess a little persistence pays off. The beds are so comfortable and have an abundance of pillows. For the money (it would have to be less than $80.00 since parking is $32.00) this hotel was worth it.	
Aug 6 2009 	Found the Hotel staff friendly and very helpful.	Nice hotel, Decorated to pre war era within the main lobby area. Rooms clean and housekeeping calls everyday. cannot fault the staff in anyway. Room decor could do with a little TLC though. Location excellent for getting around the rest of the city. Parking a little expensive at $52 per night inc Tax if you are staying for more than a few days. I parked the car at another hotel just down the road for half the price.	
Jun 28 2008 	Nice hotel	Whilst staying with family in the Bay Area we spent a few days staying here in the city. The hotel was easy to locate and in a great central position for shops, trams, tourist spots and other amenities. Staff were helpful although as a Brit I must say that the beefeaters were unintentionally hilarious especially in the 90+F temperatures. Our room, though not huge, was perfectly comfortable and was well serviced. Ice/drinks machines on the corridor were a cheaper alternative to the minibar. Only complaint about the room was the noise from the AC and other rooms, which was mainly due to the fact that a woman next door came in late and screaming, knocking on doors. However a member of staff calmed her down and all other nights were fairly quiet. Our bathroom was also small but clean. The cocktail bar on the top floor was impressive and the full length gowns/tuxedo uniform was novel - the drinks was delicious too! The restaurant downstairs was fantastic and the breakfast very reasonable. The night that we dined there it was very busy and the food was probably the best we had on our trip. The huge Borders Bookshop across the road is a good place to waste time when waiting for you reservation time too! The left luggage service was efficient and check in and out was smooth and easy. I am also impressed to see the manager responding to many of the comments.	
Nov 28 2007 	You Could (Should) Not Ask For More	My wife and I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for three days beginning the Friday after Thanksgiving. We chose the hotel based on: location, price and reviews. What a happy surprise our choice turned out to be! One half block to Union Square for the lighting of a huge Christmas Tree! Just pure luck on our part. Directly on the Powell-Hyde St. cable car, Union Square entertainment, shopping, restaurants, etc.etc.etc. You could throw a rock in any direction and hit more good restaurants than I have ever experienced in New Orleans. Great service. Every question was met with a smile and courtesy. Prompt friendly bell service and free room upgrade. Super decor, restaurant and night club atop the hotel with tremendous views. While waiting for our table at Scala's Bistro, which is in the hotel, the hostess walked out of the restaurant, up the stairs to the lobby, and found us at the bar to tell us our table was ready, all with a smile. Its a great old hotel in the city center; built years ago so expect the bathrooms to be smaller than you would wish for. I said small, not inadequate.Some tips: use public transportation while staying here. You have direct access to cable cars and buses and parking is too expensive. My best tip is to call the Muni phone number any time you want a bus or cable car. They will tell you exactly when and where to stand to catch your transportation and you get a human to talk to. Please take the 9x bus through China Town going to Fisherman's Warf. You really experience China Town that way! Free airport shuttle would make this hotel a 10.	
Jun 30 2009 	Good budget hotel in great location	A great deal in downtown SF, only around $65 to $75 a night for a single. It's basic and not fancy, but clean and well-located in the theater/Union Square area. It has free wireless Internet, cable TV (altho basic/limited) plus a lounge which offers a couple computers for those who don't have their own, a microwave &amp; adjacent laundry machines. The Spaulding is one of the best deals in downtown SF.	
Mar 17 2009 	beautiful rooms and service but......	We have just returned from a weekend in SF staying at the St Regis. The hotel is modern and clean, the rooms spacious and the staff were great. Our problem was the noise that kept us awake on both Friday and Saturday night until 2am. We naively thought it was a one off St Patrick's day party so did not request a room change for the following night-I think it was even louder the following night. Even ear plugs and a pillow over the head could not muffle the noise which was really quite unbelievable for what I presume was a number of bars in the same area. My concern is that when we checked in we were advised to stay on this side of the hotel because the views of the city are better. If the hotel knows there is a noise problem, even on the 12th floor, then I would think they would be booking out the quiet side of the hotel before they put anyone on the noisy side. When we brought this up at checkout the same person who checked us in conceded that , yes, noise from the bars could be a bit loud! It is a shame because it really is a lovely hotel but we will not stay there on our next trip to SF.	
Jun 14 2007 	This is how it's done!	I travel to San Francisco often for work; the St. Regis is the nicest and coolest one I have stayed at yet! The decor is modern, but not over the top modern, just contemporary. Beautifully appointed entry and very welcoming staff. They walked me up to my room to explain the new technology - which is highlighted by a digital device that controls everything from room service to lighting to the do not disturb sign, all with bedside convenience. The beds are fluffy and obviously extremely clean. The place was spotless. Bathroom necessities smell amazing, was tempted to swipe them! The gym is great, not huge but certainly new and good equipment. There is also a huge pool, if you are a swimmer be sure to visit. I did not use the spa during my stay but the menu looked extensive. There is a Japanese restaurant inside the hotel that had amazing sushi. The price is pretty high, but well worth it in today's market, especially for business travelers. My only complaint is that my friend parked there for 2 1/2 hours and it cost her $36. I'm from NYC and I think that is pretty insane. Overall, fantastic.	
Sep 25 2008	super elegante		
Feb 5 2007 	Disappointing.	Stayed in the Rosenkavalier- very cold room, lumpy/bouncy bed (but the bedding was fair), large bathroom, but small toilet space (coffin like)...it was shabby 1890's meets 1970...strange. The &quot;in-room library&quot; had a few classics (Milton, Shakespeare, Stendhal), a pleasant surprise.My husband and I may stay again after the renovation.Maybe.	
Jul 18 2007 	mint	we booked to stay in the adelaide but ended up in the dakota. as there were 3 of us (2 being in a couple) they sorted a room that was a little like a flat, with one bedroom and a double bed in the front room with a kitchenette. for what we paid it couldn't have been better. it was clean, in an ideal location and it was quiet.	
Oct 27 2008 	I Absolutely Loved the Donatello	I stayed at the Donatello Hotel for our recent trip to San Francisco California and let me tell you, It has to be one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff there was EXTREMELY nice, and had some of the best if not THE BEST customer service ever. They greet you with smiles on their faces and are so polite, they genuinely do make you feel very welcome. Anytime we needed something, we would call housekeeping and we would have someone knocking on our door in literally less than 5 minutes. They are so attentive and will help you in any way. They're just great. I am planning to go back to San Francisco very soon, and will definitely plan on staying at the Donatello hotel again.	
Oct 14 2008 	Donatello Was Great	We only stayed here 3 nights but I wish it could have been more. We arrived long before check in time but our room was ready and after flying from the East coast it was fabulous to get into our room. The room was large, great comfy bed and plenty of room. The hotel is also a timeshare so the guests probably stay longer and need the microwave, wet bar etc. I couldn't believe we got a smoking room in California (husband is a smoker - please no lectures) but the windows in the room could open so he would smoke right near the window so the room would be spared. No view to speak of but fresh air!The location right at Union Square was so convenient to everything.A continental brakfast is available on the club level and it was free with our room or is $4.00 - coffee, etc. fruit, danish bagels - more than enough for us. The bar - next to the restaurant is very nice and has an extended happy hour each day - very nice at the end of the day after walking the hills of San Francisco. I'd go back to the Donatello in a minute.	
Sep 18 2009 	Great place to stay. the best was comfortable.	My boyfriend &amp; I stayed here for labor day weekend and we definitely would want to stay here again and recommend it to others. Everybody in SF is so friendly &amp; very good service. It's close Chinatown and Union Square. The fisherman wharf is not that far, we took a taxi &amp; it only cost $10. Please bring map or else the taxi cab will drive you around. Get the fisherman's wharf pass is really a good deal, we didn't even finish the whole pass for three days stay. Do the duck tour was really fun. Around the area where the Fisherman's wharf sign is, there are vendors on the street, that's where cheap. Go to Nick's Lighthouse, their crab's great and you definitely need to eat it with garlic fries. Oyster's only $1.50 each. Yum yum. Overall, if we ever go back to SF, we'll not drive anymore because to go around the area, just take the bus, it's only $2 and buy snacks and water in chinatown 2 bring to the hotel room coz the room service at the hotel is really expensive and water in the room is $8. Overall, we really had a great time.	
Aug 10 2009 	Average	The Fairmont is still trading on its former glory, and if you want to tread in the footsteps of past Presidents, heads of state and other dignitaries you're at the right place. It has everything you would expect of a 4-star hotel but no more.Its location at the top of Nob Hill is ideal for walking to the main tourist sites - Union Square, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, etc. You can even walk to Pier 33 for your Alcatraz cruise (about 40 minutes). But don't forget you have to face the challenging walk back up the hill. If you think of this as muscle toning, moderately aerobic exercise you'll be fine. But if you are the least bit infirm or wheezy forget it. I actually didn't mind it that much, thinking righteously of the calories I was burning off.There's nothing wrong with this hotel but, then, there's nothing that would tempt us back there either. We would probably choose one at Fisherman's Wharf, where there's a lot more going on, and it's not 30 degrees to the horizontal.A few tips. Book Alcatraz online before you go otherwise you might not get on a cruise - they seemed to be booked up days in advance. Also, buy a 2-day ticket for an open-top bus - well worth the money. Oh, and join the Fairmont President's Club before you go, to get free Internet access if you take a laptop. Alternatively, there's a small Internet cafe just down the hill that is reasonable.	
Jul 21 2009 	Awesome tower room with city views!	Service was great! We arrived at noon and were able to check in right away. I would suggest joining the President's Club for free wi-fi and newspapers in the morning. We didn't eat at the restaurants (picky teenagers), but there are plenty of places within walking distance. They best thing is that the trolley stop is right on the street next to the hotel!	
May 20 2009 	Good time at the Fairmont	My friend and I stayed 3 nights at the Fairmont and would definately return. The room (2 queens) was plenty big, enormous walk in closet, well appointed bathroom. Nice view of the city from room 608. Room service was speedy, but quite expensive ($27 in food ended up costing $45 with tips, fees, taxes, etc). Reception was speedy, friendly, helpful. The concierge service was fabulous--tips, advice, tickets, anything our hearts desired. Baggage service took extra precautions with my lap top, and immediately produced our stuff when we needed our bags. The health club receptionist recommended I join the President's Club (------------, took about 2 minutes and they only wanted basic demographics). My President's Club number saved me the $10/day gym fee and the $13.95/day internet access fee. It also got me clean work out wear to borrow (I forgot my running shoes). The only service problem was waiting over an hour for a maid to bring me the shoes. I'm sure the rack rate is steep, but I would return to the hotel without a second thought if I could get a deal. The Tonga Room is a hoot--don't miss the rain storms with buffet and 1/2 price drinks at Happy Hour.	
Jan 20 2008 	Lovely Weekend	My husband and I spent four nights at the Fairmont San Francisco last weekend. We had a fabulous weekend and the hotel only added to our wonderful weekend. This hotel has a beautiful lobby that reminds one of grand hotels of years long past. They just don't make them like that any more. Our check in was superb. We are President's Club members and that may add to the perfect service but I hope that everyone experiences the same friendly, helpful welcome we received. Our room was on the 19th floor overlooking the bay. The views from the upper floors overlooking the bay are about as great as you will get in the city. The room was a nice size with a very comfortable bed and nice sitting area and a nice working desk. I too, as someone else mentioned, miss not having tea making facilities in the room. We didn't even think about getting tea sent to the room. My bad.The location of the hotel is just the very best. A tip that we will share is that if you take the cable car down Powell to Market, and you are over 65, you can buy a month pass for city transportation for $10 at the green kiosk right by the cable car turning platform. They also have two and three day passes but the monthly senior pass is the best buy. They didn't even ask for our identification cards. Drats! So for the 4 days we were in San Francisco we could cable car, bus, trolley, or surface rail cars for $20 total for both of us. We used all forms of transport and went far and wide and found the service was excellent. And, the Fairmont is perfectly located to use the public transit services to the fullest. A couple of things did not come up to our expectations and we commented on these on our Satisfaction Form we filled out and left with the front desk on our departure. Our housekeeping services were not top notch. Every morning when we would leave the room there would be dishes sitting outside the rooms on our hallway. When we came back to the hotel in the evenings the same dishes were still in the hall and a full day's worth more dishes had been added. I don't know if the responsibility is housekeeping or food services but we found it objectionable. We pointed this out to the front desk twice and the dishes were picked up shortly thereafter but the next day it was just the same. And, the dirty glasses in our room were not removed nor clean glasses put in the room each day. When we call down to housekeeping and said we did not have clean glasses in the bathroom, a gentleman brought up one glass for us. I didn't bother sending him back for another one so we shared our one clean glass as I had given him the two dirty glasses that were still beside our door. (we tried leaving the dirty glasses in the room and setting them out in the hall - neither plan resulted in clean glasses in the room.) There are no chocolates on the pillows in the evening, nor fresh flowers or fruit in the room when you check in. This is rather standard in first class hotels such as The Four Seasons, or The Peninsula. The prices at the Fairmont are similar to the top hotels but the little extras that the other hotels provide aren't part of the Fairmont experience. Now that being said, let me tell you that we were in San Fran for my birthday and that came out at our check in. We came in that evening after spending the afternoon walking around China Town and found chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne from the hotel. That we thought was brilliant! First Class, Top Drawer and all that. This is not our first or last stay at this hotel. We would not stay in another hotel in San Francisco because we like many things about the hotel. The location, the quite good breakfast buffet, the wonderful halls lined with historical pictures and just the general feel of the hotel. We would overlook the small deficiencies because we like this hotel very much and would recommend it to anyone going to San Francisco and especially someone going for a first visit to the city.	
Aug 3 2006 	Love this place!	I am staying at the gaylord at the moment and think it is absolutely fantastic. The room is nicely decorated, and I can't praise the comfort of the bed enough! Fluffy pillows and a huge duvet make for a great night's sleep! It comes fully equipped with microwave, fridge and freezer, cutlery etc. The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is because the room is slightly smaller than I expected and you can hear a bit of traffic from the rooms closest to the street. As for the neighborhood, the hotel is located in the theater district, and while it is adjacent to the tenderloin neighborhood the area is easily avoided. The hotel is in great proximity to union square and all its restaurants and of course, the theaters, which are fantastic (only five minutes from the half price theater ticket booth in union square too). The Gaylord is highly recommended and I intend to stay here again!	
Oct 13 2009 	Great fun value hotel in central location	I really recomment this hotel. Having spent a lot of money on expensive hotels, this hotel gives me hope that you dont have to splash out to have a great stay in a fun, clean modern hotel in a central part of san francisco. Whilst not in the central touristy part near union square, it is two minutes walk to the tram and bus stops on market street which go to all the important parts of the city. Almost felt that it was our own apartment. We were on the fifth floor with a great view of the city. Whilst its not luxurious, for the money, its perfect. There were quite a few homeless people around the area, but i soon realised it was all over San Fran, not just on the streets around the hotel. If you are nervous of this, it might be better to stay on Nob hill or Union Squre, but i wouldnt, as too touristy.	
Sep 2 2009 	Good Hotel ..... Not So Good !	Hotel Staff was pleasant enough and initially the place seemed okay. Things went downhill quickly though upon being eaten alive by Bed Bugs !!! I have been traveling for business 25 years and this is the first time I have encountered Bed Bugs ... disturbing, the hotel was not very concerned with it when told so I promptly checked out and relocated to a more reputable hotel. The neighborhood, although seemingly in a revitalization period, was somewhat scary, and I travel all over the world and am in many big cities. There were a few good restaurants about but a nervous walk after sundown. Overall I cannot recommend this property.	
Aug 15 2006 	Affordable and clean	I was very skeptical of this hotel due to some of the reviews I read here on TripAdvisor. However, I was very pleased with my experience. I went there knowing it was not a five star hotel and I would only get the basics. I brought my own alarm clock. They do have hair dryers at the hotel and an iron that you check out from the front desk for free. The hotel staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. This hotel is perfect for the budget traveller. The bathroom was large and clean and the room featured a HUGE walk in closet. The bedsheets did smell of the laundry detergent, so if you are sensitive to this smell, you may reconsider staying here. The windows are large and screenless, so if you have a child you might not want to stay here. It is generally cool in San Fran with no bugs at all, so having the windows open is no problem. I got more than I had expected from this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone. I had a friend stay at another hotel two blocks away for $150/night and her hotel lobby was nicer, but her room wasn't.	
Sep 20 2009 	very nice!	I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel, very well located on Powell St (cable car street), indeed a bit noisy but if you want a hotel in the center you can't really avoid it! The 2 receptionnists were polite and helpful, when I asked about a self-service computer available, I was answered they had none, but that I could go to their other hotel (Spaulding hotel) just next to the Herbert, and use a computer for free there (and that's what I did).The room was quite large, very clean, comfortable, with a modern decoration.The bathroom (washbasin, taps...) looked brand new and the toiletries smelled wonderful!I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel!	
Oct 13 2008 	Great hotel in the center of San Francisco	I stayed in this hotel for a few days and it was worth it.The location was great, right at the center of Union Square, a block away from Macys..but not noisy at night.The staff was very welcoming and helpful in helping me organize my stay...The manager was a sweet heart and always made sure my stay at the hotel was a good experience.I m usually very picky about staying in a clean hotel room and I was not disappointed..everything was spotless.Very good quality-price.I ll definitely come back !	
Sep 11 2009 	Lovely hotel great location	Our stay here was a pleasure. Staff was very friendly. Location is excellent, steps away from Union Square, which is central, but less of a tourist trap than Fisherman's Wharf. We were lucky to have a room on the upper floor (6th, I believe), in the back, which meant no street noise and plenty day light. Since this is a narrow hotel, I wonder whether the other rooms might have a view of the wall of the building next door (don't know about this though). Daily newspaper is complementary, which we appreciated very much. Breakfast was fine, better than most continental breakfasts we had during our stay in the U.S. (and we've stayed in many hotels). Enjoyed the tea selection and cookies! Both room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. Good size bed, comfortable. We booked a superior room online (Hotels.com) and found a good deal (book 3 nights, pay for 2), which was wonderful since this is not a very cheap hotel. Would come again if we could find the same deal. :)	
Feb 5 2009 	Don't ask just come over !	This is my one-stop choice when staying in San Francisco.Whenever arriving from the airport you're just one short BART ride away to the hotel, and you can just drop your gear, and just go to any venue downtown. Do not stop at airport hotels, don't go far away, stay at the Mosser, enjoy their cozy hotel hall, talk to plenty of other people traveling in the bay, and get a great deal of fun for your stay in CA.	
Nov 6 2007 	A gem just off Market	I've stayed at the Hotel Mosser several times, most recently in June 2007.I love it and plan to stay there next time I'm in SF.It's a quirky, charming hotel with fabulous staff. I've recognized the same staff over my last three stays (2005-2007), which tells me that it's a good place to work. And it's really nice to see familiar faces behind the desk. :-) Service has always been great.I usually travel alone on business, so I get the single room with the shared bath. On my last two stays, the private toilet was across the hall and the shared bath right next door, which worked out fine.My rooms have always been clean and secure. The room is small. You won't be throwing a party in there, unless it's just two of you. Maybe three. Rooms on the outside of the building can be noisy: I sleep with earplugs when I travel and have no problem. Rooms on the interior of the building are quiet, I'm told.WiFi is available in the room from AT&amp;T for about $10 per 24 hrs. Of course you can find free WiFi through the city.The Mosser is located about 1.5 blocks from Market St in one direction and Moscone Center in the other. I usually fly into SFO and take the BART downtown to the Powell St stop. It's easy walking distance from there to the hotel. Directly around the corner is Mel's Diner, where American Graffitti was filmed. Pricier restaurants are nearby.If you need lots of elbow room and amenities, there's a Marriott across the street. If you'd like an inexpensive place to stay, the Mosser is fabulous and you can use the money you save for drinks at the Marriott's swanky 39th floor cocktail lounge.	
Oct 21 2009 	It's a high-class hostel - not a hotel	I booked the Opal Hotel through Hotwire.com. I prepaid for three nights, but the dangerous, smelly and otherwise uncomfortable conditions prompted my decision to only stay for one! Here's the story:The hotel was presented on hotwire.com as a two star hotel with various amenities including a gym, free breakfast, free in-room wired and lobby wireless internet. I was not expecting much from a two-star hotel, but the final booking ending up costing me just short of $150 per night - and my many years of booking with them always led to me clean, safe and relatively quiet hotels that are obviously inexpensive. The Opal Hotel smelled dirty, was definitely not safe and was loud (not noise from the street, but the hotel itself) - I felt betrayed by Hotwire.com for sending me to such a terrible place. Did you ever see that scene in Big (starring Tom Hanks) where he checks into that hostel/hotel and cries himself to sleep on the bed? This was similar - and it was the first time I've experience such a stay after using hotwire for over 7 years! Here's the timeline:10:00pm - My wife and I arrive at the address. There are at least two or three vagrants on all sides of the building. After circling the building we find the parking lot entrance, which is guarded by one of these vagrants who is obviously under the influence. There is no signage, but he pushes a small button to speak to a hotel employee and slurs out that there is a guest at the entrance and that he wants to use the bathroom. After telling us the cost for parking (about $30/night - standard for San Francisco), the gate opened. If the vagrant had followed our car in, I would have left immediately as the parking lot looked ominous and the entrance to the lobby wasn't clear. BTW - I'm from LA, love downtown urban centers, and I know the difference between a well-meaning homeless person and a vagrant. All these guys were drugged out, drunk and scary. 10:05pm - The vagrant politely stands outside of the gate (as though there was an understanding between him and the hotel staff that he should not enter), and yells directions to us while also asking for money. My wife and I take a circuitous route carrying our luggage up a flight of stairs, through the motel parking lot portion of the &quot;hotel,&quot; beyond the cramped gym with very poor exercise equipment, and into a musty smelling elevator with a loud level bell. We finally enter the lobby proper and are greeted with a curt gentleman who promptly checks us in.10:10pm - After a trip in another musty elevator, we walk down the hallway and just beyond another elevator, we find our room. Here's my criticism after staying in it one night:1. It was a bit on the small size (even for San Francisco), but better in size than other rooms I've been in. It was worse in all other respects. 2. The shower/sink water never got beyond warm, the bathroom was cramped, top bedspread looked stained - we just moved it off the bed though.3. The window treatments (covering a view of another building - again though, not a big deal in SF) were worn.4. The television image and sound cut out when you walked near it.5. I felt itchy just walking into the room. I'm glad we didn't get the bedbugs room that a previous reviewer got! 6. The air conditioning unit blew directly onto the bed - which led to me feeling too cold or, when the AC turned off, too hot. The AC also clicked a bit when turning on and off.7. The more annoying sound was the elevator bell going off every time it passed our floor - think of the sound a service bell makes going on right outside a normal (not sound proof or anything) door. There was also a tenant or employee in the room above us STOMPING up and down on the floor every five minutes (as though they were passing back and forth to the bathroom or otherwise pacing). Having seen a few of the hotel's clients, I would think that drugs may have had some influence in our upstairs neighbor's behavior. After checking with the front desk, they politely but firmly said they could not move us to any other room or do anything else to help us.12:00am - I knew I wasn't going to get good sleep, but felt stuck in the hotel that night. I went online and began looking for places to stay the following day - I could not have survived another night.9:00am (the next day) - The vagrants were largely gone the next morning (thought I drove by the next night and they had returned). I told the front desk that we were checking out early and the employee already seemed to know we were going too. Instead of asking what he could do to help, he simply referred us to hotwire.com for a refund. BOTTOM LINE: If I had booked a $50/night one star hotel, I would have been satisfied. This place felt like a hostel with private rooms. I'm a frequent traveler and would have preferred to stay in a roadside motel - this place had bad vibes. For Hotwire.com and this hotel to charge over $100/night for this supposed two star hotel is an outrage. After sending my complaint to Hotwire and requesting a refund of the two nights I did not stay, they said they would take 5-7 days to investigate the matter and get back to me. 24 hours later they responded, but with a generic $50 credit on my next booking. They did not address any of the specific complaints that I provided above and obviously didn't take the time to investigate it. I am very disappointed in their service and obviously more disappointed in my stay at this hotel. The hotel could take some simple steps to improve the experience - disabling the elevator bell and hiring a security guard would have gone a long way. Until they do, don't stay here and think twice before booking through hotwire.com. I feel their ratings and prices are misguided at best - and greedily designed at worst.	
Sep 26 2009 	Great Hotel - Friendly Staff	We spent 6 nights at The Orchard as part of our honeymoon. I contacted the hotel beforehand to arrange for flowers and champagne to be in the room on arrival as a surprise for my wife and the concierge sorted it all out ready for us arriving. On checking in the hotel gave us a voucher for a discount to eat in their restaurant and there were chocolates and a bottle of wine from the hotel to accompany the flowers and champagne which was a nice gesture. We had a room on the top floor (10th) though there's no great view even from here. The room itself was fine, plenty of space, clean and with everything we needed. A well stocked mini bar which was even reasonably priced, there was a dvd player in the room and a selection of films to borrow from reception if you wanted to relax in the room. The bathroom was large, modern and a good range of toiletries provided. The only negative thing we found was that if taking a shower in the morning we had to leave it running for several minutes to get hot water though it was fine at other times of the day and we got hot water straight away at the sink.Reception, the concierge and housekeeping were all very friendly and helpful whenever we needed anything or when we just passed them going in and out. The hotel deliver a newspaper to every room each morning free of charge which proved to be helpful as we used that to see what events were going on in the city each day and found a couple of things to do that way that we otherwise probably wouldn't have known about. The location is great, just a couple of blocks walk down to Union Square , the cable car runs right past the hotel and it's not far to catch buses to anywhere else you might wat to go in the city. If you don't like hills though or you've over indulged at the Cheesecake Factory in Macy's the last block when walking up to the hotel from Union Square is short but very steep. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back to The Orchard if we ever make it back to San Francisco.	
Jan 9 2009 	A great experience	We stayed at the Orchard hotel for two nights and were not dissappointed. The hotel staff are incredibly helpful, friendly and professional. We were also very lucky to be upgraded to a King suite that exceeded our expectations. The room had more than we needed, was spacious, clean and had a fantastic king sized comfortable bed. Our room overlooked the Powel/Bush intersection, which can be a little noisey due to the cable car tracks however some amount of noise is inevitable when staying in the heart of a busy city. We were happy to make this sacrifice to be close to the action - only two blocks to Union Square. I wish we could have stayed longer and hope to return to this lovely hotel (and city) soon! I highly recommend 'Mama's on Washington Square' for breakfast but get there early to avoid the queue!	
Apr 28 2004	Fantastic		
Sep 26 2009 	As expected	stayed for one night - typical Ritz Carlton experience - excellent staff, well trained and welcoming - stayed on Club Level - Club Level lounge very nice - lovely snacks all day, a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing - room was nice, though a little 'chintzy' - very comfy bed with enough pillows for a dozen beds - bathroom nice size - shower nice, with Bulgari toiletries ( a small thing, but a nice touch) - plenty of towels - location good, just above union Square, though it is at the top of a steep hill.i checked out early but had a late flight - hotel had no problem with me using the Club Lounge all day on and off - Concierge was very friendly, helped me find tickets for the ball game without using a rip off ticket broker - all small touches but thats why people come back to RC chain	
Apr 13 2009 	As Good As It Gets	One of the prior reviewers may have said it best-----&quot;What more do you want?&quot; This is the best-run Ritz Carlton where I have stayed, and one of the best &quot;city hotels&quot; anywhere. Beautiful, spacious rooms that are classic in the traditional Ritz look, yet with modern amenities such as flat screen TVs and I-pod docking stations. Large marble bathrooms. We had an interior view room. In many city hotels this is the kiss of death, and you look out onto a dreary courtyard or &quot;air shaft.&quot; At the Ritz SF I actually prefer the Courtyard view----its a really pretty landscaped courtyard with semi-permanent white party tent in the middle.  Wonderful, classic lobby. One of my favorite experiences at the Ritz SFwas having evening cocktails in the Lobby Lounge----very sophisticated room, well-mixed cocktails, perfectly elegant. Service is incredible. When you check in, after giving your name to bellhop in driveway, they greet you by name when you walk in the front door.One of the other reviewers found this a bit hokey or over-the-top. I did not. Employees uniformly greet you as you walk past. Very service-oriented. After touring around the city during the day, it was always a pleasure to return to this hotel, which seemed like an elegant and calm oasis in the middle of the city.	
Aug 26 2007 	What staying at the Ritz should be!	I stayed at the Ritz for one night of a recent business trip. At the last minute, my husband joined me and so I experienced the hotel both as a business traveler and as a romantic getaway.The Ritz scored well on both counts. As a business hotel, it is conveniently located near the financial district. The business center servies (though pricey) are vast, so you can quickly get what you need. The wireless connected quickly and was stable - though only one computer could be connected to the internet at once. As a more romantic getaway, the Ritz was nice. I was working through my birthday, and the hotel staff helped my husband surprise me with some of the best chocolate-covered strawberries I've ever had along with champagne. We also had a delicious dinner in our room, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The service was excellent on all fronts as well. Honestly, I was a little too relaxed for a business trip!Sometimes you stay at higher-end properties and it is overrated...the Ritz, however, earned its name during our one-night stay.	
Apr 16 2007	Fantastic Beautiful loved it	This is a beautiful hotel. We could not have asked for anything better. The food, the rooms, the people and staff were all so nice and dedicated to making our stay just perfect. If you go to San Francisco, make sure this is the place you stay.	
Nov 23 2005	Great Deal	We stayed at the Stratford 11/11 for one night prior to returning home - we had stayed at the Sir Francis Drake on 11/5-6/05.The Straford was not as fancy but our room was larger than at the Sir Francis Drake and equally clean and quite.11/5 people were coming into SFO for the USC-UC football game and hotel rooms were at a premium - one boisterous young fan was quoted on the one room but his foul language keep him from getting a room - the manager was adamant that he would not put up with that kind of behavior.Room was small versus what we are used to but as we learned all rooms in SFO are small. Room was very clean and bright - no a/c but not needed. Room was perpendicular to Powell and very quite.Serve a continetal breakfast on 2nd floor which looked fine - we ate at Lefty O'Doul's again! Liked Lefty's.Absolutely would stay at the Stratford again - paid about $ 120+ for Sir Francis on line and less than $ 60 on line at the StratfordLocation was great - if we return we will stay on Powell and not off Powell - not sure I would want to be more than 2-3 blocks either side of Powell.	
Sep 2 2008	Centralissimo		
Sep 2 2009 	Nice hotel close to everything	very nice comfortable stay, excellent gym facilities!	
Aug 2 2009	Good value	Was nicer than I expected. Had third floor room not facing traffic, so no noise problem. Staff were pleasant, parking free and loved the location in that we could walk everywhere easily - and there was a 7 - 11 right across the street for snacks etc., Walgreens and Safeway nearby. Boudin's 50yds away for a great breakfast on the wharf! Other more expensive hotels nearby really didn't look that much nicer, other than they had interior corridors. Would definitely recommend for cheapest place to stay on Fisherman's Wharf.	
Nov 10 2009 	Nice location but bed bugs in the bed	I stayed in this Hotel in 2007 and remembered it much cleaner and bug free. This time I came back for 4 nights and was a bid disappointed: the room was much smaller and did not seem as clean as I remembered. On the second day I woke up with some bites on my arm, I thought these were from mosquitos, but soon after I saw bedbugs in the sheets. Breakfast is good.Staff is nice.shame about the bugs!	
Apr 23 2007	Price appropriate good location clean enough recommended	We live in San Francisco and this is our go-to place for friends when they need a couple of nights. The rate is amazing for the location and quality of room and space. Just checked out this morning for our friend from Hong Kong, $44/night ($50 total-tax!) for a Sat and Sun night stay. During busy weekends they are about $186/night, and that's TOO much. If you can get a $80/night and under rate, go for it. $10/night for parking and free wi-fi. Ask for a room on second level and only accept rooms that are facing Valencia Street. Don't bother with their breakfast, just walk around the corner to a DeLessio Markey for wonderful baked good and hot food. This is a wonderful motel to just crash and sleep. We have never had any threat issues (in room or parking lot) but remember you are not in Kansas. It's still a big city and you are staying in a 2 star motel, be prepared to roll with the punches. For our wedding in 2005, we offered Travelodge as the inexpensive choice for guests, the other 2 being Mark Hopkins and Holiday Inn. Guests who stayed here at the $45/night rate gave glowing reviews.	
Jun 26 2007 	Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in	I have travelled all over the world, spent hundreds of nights in hotels and this was the worst night I have ever spent in a hotel.The room was a cave. Cold, drafty(had to put towels under the door). The bed was lumpy. The towels were so thin you could see them and weren't much bigger than a Hand Towel. The blankets were barely thicker. The pillows here about as thick as a thick crust pizza.You could hear the street traffic. Anyone walking on the walkway outside and the person above us.The only escape was the TV and the picture was horrible.I figured the name &quot;Travelodge&quot; would mean a better place to stay.	
May 7 2007 	OK for the price if you get a room away from the street.	I had a hard time finding a decent place downtown that would allow pets for under $125 a night. This place was the best compromise under $100. It is in a nice middle class neighborhood but is on one of the busiest surface streets in the city so there is a lot of road noise. The top floor rooms have a vaulted ceiling which is nice and the rooms were old but clean. This is an older motel. Having just left a Carmel B&amp;B that was not much more expensive than this motel, it seemed expensive for what you got. It is convenient to most of the tourist attractions and there are several decent restaurants within walking distance. The staff was very friendly and helpful.	
Jan 2 2007 	A Good Stay but may try elsewhere next time	My husband and I stayed a the W for 7 days. Initially, I found it difficult to communicate and make sure it was noted with the staff about our needs for late arrival and late checkout. Even though I called several times, I am a double/triple checker!, there seemed to be no indication of this on record. Upon arriving very late at night, the W lived up to its cool and clubby atmosphere. The XYZ bar was not a disturbance and has a nice crowd each evening without being overwhelming to the hotel enviroment. The W hotel staff was very young in their 20's and a bit pretentious. Its the W, what can I say. Our room was an &quot;upgraded&quot; room which meant, we were on a higher floor. We had a king size bed but it is smaller than a &quot;real&quot; king size. The room itself was small and a bit worn out. A nice feature was the cushioned window bench overlooking a great view and the bliss products in our room. I tipped the hotel cleaning staff each day and left a little note to receive more bath products. After going to the Bliss spa in the hotel, I saw the 6 pack of goodies we get in our rooms sells for $25! at Bliss. It was well worth the little extra I added to the tip each day. Everything in the hotel is very expensive...a Voss water bottle goes for $8. I recommend finding the closest Walgreens, which there are many around that area, and loading up on some munchies and water. There is also a liquor store nearby on 3rd and Mission (across the street) where you can stock up on spirits too. Hotel is located within a 5 minute walk to Market Street, the main street where you can get on virtually any bus. The area is quieter than Union Square but a 10 min walk gets you to Union Square for shopping. 2 blocks away is the Metreon movie theater. Overall, W location was great given our activities. OH..parking is $45. If you plan on renting a car and not touching it for a few days, move your car to the SOMA parking garage, 3 minutes away, for $20 a night parking. The valets from the W park you car here anyway. Only problem is the garage closes daily at 11pm. I highly recommend buying the PASSPORT for the Muni system. They are hard to find but you can get them at Union Sq. right where the Hyde-Powell cable car turns around. Also, buy the Muni map for $6 at Walgreens which gives you all the information you need to get around the Muni system. Overall, we enjoy modern decor but after 7 days we missed the more homey traditional style hotels like the Hyatt. The W hotels halls and elevator waiting areas are dark and their is lounge music playing 24/7. Even we had our limits. Hotel looked like it needed some updates. Location, window seat, and bath products compensated. May return or will try the Westin St Francis at Union Square. Right in the hustle and bustle.	
Nov 11 2004	Poor service poor attitudes	I planned a romantic weekend getaway for my boyfriend &amp; myself and another couple. Looking forward to splurging, I knew that the W Hotels had a reputation for being top-notch, even tough a little pricey. Unfortunately, this romantic getway was not all we expected.Bad:Service overall was terrible. Starting at the front desk, they were all too cool to be speaking to mere mortals, such as myself.I had booked 2 king bed, non-smoking rooms with a view of bridge. When I checked in, none of these options were available. After some debate, they were able to find me non-smoking rooms with a shabby view, each with 2 double beds. So much for romance.Parking was soooooo expensive! We decided to park ourselves around the corner in a public garage and later saw the W staff parking their valeted cars there, as well, for double the cost.Rooms were small for the price, and anything you touched cost an ungodly amount of money. Consierge supposedly booked reservations, which were not ready at the correct time.Doorman service for taxis was useless! Easier to fetch your own cab.Good:I loved the Aveda bathroom amenities.The beds were great!Overall:Try the Adagio. We loved that place!	
Jan 10 2003 	WWWonderful!		
May 11 2008 	Charming great location overpriced	I booked this hotel through the JavaOne conference web site for $175/night.The lobby is small and typical of the boutique genre. The folks at the front desk are friendly, and check-in was quick and pleasant. Although they were pretty sure the hotel was able to honor a government rate, they were unable to give one. They copied my ID and said they'd talk to management, but I never saw a discount appear on my bill.Upon entering the room, I was struck by how nice and charming it looked (really bad pictures taken with my phone enclosed).I received the Chronicle each morning, which I enjoyed.Other visitors complained of poor water pressure--mine was fine. My room was clean and there was no sign of mold (as another reviewer had said).Others complained of a poor or dodgy location. They're nuts. The hotel is in the heart of the theater and shopping district, it's walking distance from Chinatown, North Beach, the Civic Center, and the Moscone Convention Center (to which I walked each day for a week). Several great restaurants are located within a block. And dodgy? By their definition, the entire city is dodgy. The homeless are everywhere, not just here. Now, the Tenderloin is dodgy, but It's blocks away, but close enough that visitors should learn where it is. I've walked through it many times at midnight. (I was only on Market, but I still didn't like it.) My small complaints include squeaky plumbing and doors on the closet.I was disappointed that breakfast wasn't included.I also couldn't believe that the refrigerator was located at the head of the bed. I just unplugged it at night. The other problem with the refrigerator is that while I was given a key to it, there was no obvious place to use it. It appeared that the lock was covered with a disposable pull tab, but there weren't any directions on the key, nor the pull tab. Since it wasn't obvious how to open the refrigerator, and I didn't really need to open it (except to satisfy my curiosity on how it was stocked), I didn't want to risk breaking something.The traffic noise was loud, but I can't take any points away for this as a room on the second floor on Geary is going to be loud. Earplugs were sufficient to ensure a good nights sleep, however, and the bed was certainly comfortable. A room on the top floor should be much better, as well as a room in the back (although you'd probably give up the view).And finally, the room was way overpriced. I'd be comfortable paying $125 for the room (so the sub-$100 Priceline deals are great bargains).	
May 14 2009 	Nice Hotel	I found the hotel to be modern and good with a friendly staff. My room was nice and clean with a view of the gardens. The hotel is not far from curtain locations: The Museum of Modern Art is just down the block down; Union Square is two blocks away and etc. The is Bart is near by (Montgomery Station) and the F line trolly bus, goes up and down Market Street to Fisherman's Wharf. One draw back, there are no immediate outside restaurants by the hotel. You can find Calif Pizza, Subway, Starbucks and a couple of small cafes by the bart. The area is pretty much office buildings with other near by hotels: Fours Season and W.	
Nov 20 2008 	Always a good experience	My boyfriend and I go to San Francisco once every two months. We both lived there for many years, and have a lot of friends to frequently visit. This hotel is the first one we consider staying at each time. The rooms are clean, the location is great, and the floor to ceiling windows offer great views. Westin also usually has great deals.	
Oct 30 2007 	Good Hotel - Great Location	My gf and I stayed here from 8/10 to 12/10 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.As as been said before this is primarily a business hotel and so the room was therefore rather more functional than anything else. They were however a reasonable size and very clean. The internet access in our room wasn't working but we didn't realise this until our last day and so declined the hotel offer to move rooms.The best thing about this hotel, certainly for us, was the location. It is situated a few blocks from Union Square with all the associated shopping and restaurants. The cable car line begins a 5 min walk away although its probably better to walk on to a later stop where you won't have to queue. If you want to get to Fishermans Wharf quicker than by cable car it was only just over $10 by cab.I would recommend this hotel if you are only staying for a short while but for any longer I would choose one that is more tourist oriented.	
Mar 28 2008 	Unique Fun change of pace.	We stayed at the White Swann for 3 nights around the first of February and loved it. The breakfasts were great, lots of choices, fresh fruit, quiche, croissants etc. The rooms were different and fun, our daughter loved the bears and ended up taking one home. The evening wine social was a nice time to meet others and relax. The hotel is close to cable cars, Union square etc. very easy to get around. Tip: get a MUNI 3 day pass for the buses and cable cars etc. and you save tons on transportation.$18 for three days was a great deal.You will not be disappoitnted with the White Swann Inn.	
May 6 2005 	Beware of the bathtub!!!!	I gave this hotel a 2 star rating because it is not a Hotel... it's a large Bed &amp; Breakfast with a few distinct problems. #1 The bathtubs are an absolute nightmare! Think &quot;YUK&quot; and you'll get a mental picture. They are so old that they're rusty and corroded around the drains. The hotel is supposedly redoing them next week, but what good did that do me? I got robbed out of my daily hot bath &amp; wore flip flops in the shower so my feet didn't have to touch the black stuff. I asked to switch rooms, but the only one available with a refinished bathtub had a BROKEN FIREPLACE!!! Real classy.#2 If you have eyesight problems, don't try to watch TV. It's a million miles away from the bed.#3 The bed is REALLY comfy, but the rest of the room needs help.#4 Old, old, old elevator.#5 OK, ok... So it's within walking distance of Union Square &amp; Chinatown. However, all the hotels along Powell Street (Westin St. Francis, Chancellor, etc.) are MUCH more convenient!!! If you want to stay off Powell, choose The Orchard.The saving grace of this B&amp;B is the yummy breakfast buffet, the SUPERIOR wine/ fruit &amp; cheese sampling at 5:00pm, and the adorable bellman, Louis. The only way that I would ever stay at this B&amp;B again is if they sent me a voucher for a free night's stay AFTER they refinished the ALL bathtubs &amp; fixed ALL the fireplaces. Otherwise, for the hefty $200 price tag, I'm at the Westin St. Francis.Hope my reveiw helps!	
Nov 21 2007 	great hotel	I stayed at this hotel in Nov 2007 as it was recommended to me by the Tennis Masters Cup ticket agents in Shanghai. I was told that it was one of the hotels near the Qi Zhong tennis centre.The only negative aspect of this hotel is that it is in the middle of the HongQiao industrial zone!!! To get to anywhere near ( subway, shops etc) you need to take a taxi and it was no where near the tennis center. I ended taking a taxi there the first 2 days ( 30-45 min trip, depending on traffic ,60 - 70 RNMB one way) and then took the shuttles to and from the pick-up points around Shanghai once I got my bearings. I was told by the managment team that there will be a subway station 2 minutes' walk form the hotel byt the end of this year.Otherwise, I had no complaints about this hotel. Great hotel, clean, large, modern rooms. It is also part of some art initiative and so there are pieces of modern art scultpures, paintings, displays all over the hotel. Hotel is sophisticated and well decorated. All rooms have either wifi, internet access, cable tv. Breakfast was both continental and Chinese. There is a full service restaurant there as well specialising in Chinese and Italian cuisine- not very expensive. Staff very friendly and helpful, esp for translating destinations to taxi drivers in chinese. Beware that the average person in Shanghai speaks very little english but the young people are speaking more English now. It is a good idea to learn a few phrases in Mandarin.I would definitely stay there again once the subway station has been completed to make it easier to get into central Shanghai.Arrived at Pudong intl and took the line 3 bus at the airport to the Yin He ( Galaxy) hotel then took a taxi from there to the hotel. Hotel is definitely nearer Hong Qiao airport and taxi there cost about 45 RNMB. I checked out one day after I arrived as I had to fly to Beijing for 2 days and my luggage was stored and I was upgraded to a bigger room/ business room when I returned to check in the 2nd time around.All in all , great , modern, classy hotel best suited for businessmen who have come to do business in the hundreds of factories in the area. Very quiet and all rooks sound-proofed. Having said that, there were many tourists at hotel as well. Shanghai is a great city and will definitely visit again.Enjoy the stay and , by the way, the pics of the hotel are accurate.If anyone wants to contact me about the tennis masters cup , feel free.	
Nov 7 2007 	The great and the good	The great thing about the Central hotel is it's location, just over halfway along the Nanjing road and one block back from the Peoples Plaza so not only are you in the midst of the main shopping street of the city but you can enjoy the elderly Chinese doing their Tai Chi in the morning! The good thing is that it feels more 'Chinese' than say some of the other larger European properties close by, from the Chinese bride in the lobby talking on her mobile to the good Chinese restaurant on the first floor which serves wholesome fare leaving off the menu some of the dishes so beloved of westerners, the ambience is good. The rooms are more than adequate with all amenities (try and book a corner room as it's more spacious with picture windows) and the service is always gracious. Its a short walk down Nanjing road to the Bund (The famous Peace Hotel is closed for refurbishment) and to the 'village' of old Shanghai. Word of warning do not get taken in by English speaking 'students' offering to show you tea ceremonies, art exhibitions etc - it's a scam. The food is varied and plentiful with the evening buffet good value.	
Nov 28 2006 	Check your bill!	This hotel appearred to be value for money but found that they attempted to charge for items listed as &quot;free&quot; in the booking. We left with the feeling that the management and staff were purposefully trying to defraud us. Other much smaller problems included rooms not being ready when we arrived, bed sizes being smaller than booked, and problems getting our luggage delivered to our rooms. We have stayed at many other hotels in China and we give this one the thumbs down.	
Apr 28 2009 	proprio centrale!		
Feb 18 2008 	a impressed hotel during my trip to China	during the last Chritmas' and New Year's holiday, I traveled to China with my families. Booked by my Chinese friend, the Crowne Plaza Hotel offered an excellent services to us which gave us a memorable impression. The staffs are very friendly to our foreigners, in particular, some of them can speak English such fluently as they could answer my any request in English. The services are value-added in terms of its lower price. I wish I could enjoy their services next time when I have opportunity to China again.	
Jun 18 2009 	Some Jewels missing from this Crowne..!!!	When one is travelling to a new country, especially for business everything has to impeccable and done in style.. And, if it's China then a tad bit handy would be a Mandarin dictionary.. Which I didn't carry as a hotel which terms itself as a 5 - Star would live up to those standards..It did somewhere, but faltered too a bit.. It may learn as the wheel progresses.. The catch up line of Crowne Plaza is 'The Place to Meet' - and, yes it does exude a business atmosphere. But, the hotel is located very much at the extreme end of Shanghai.. So, if you are travelling from the Pudong International Airport - be ready for a trip which excites you initially, as you are in Shanghai and every sight is welcoming. But, as you progress and your tired weary self wants a nap - the taxi seat is not the cushion you need..!!Atlast, you arrive and a friendly staff greets you.. A must need to keep your hotel in the niche.. However, some uppity managers may act a bit skeptical although, you have a confirmed ballroom schedule and the business manager has to be apologetic..The rooms are a treat as one gets to soak away their worries and warm their senses in the bathrobe.. As one works on the schedule, breakfast time flies away every morning.. A sleepy walk, but finally a sumptuous and yummy breakfast greets you..The Congee and the Dimsums were my favourite.. The pancakes with honey and maple syrup just melt away.. while braised mushrooms with the unique flavour of China is a must have..Thus, the king-size breakfast sets the ball rolling for the seminar of my company and the staff is really helpful.. Also, the conceirge deserves a pat on the back for the job well done.. But, sometimes the staff doesn't approach the foreign guests as they have a problem with the English.. However, the Hotel lives up to its stature and despite, the distance it is a Place to Meet..Haibo was there.. Who Haibo..? find out.. A blue-fellow who likes to wave a Hi..	
Mar 5 2006 	Good hotel but at an expensive price	I am in Shanghai over 30 times a year and try the Grand Hyatt every now and then out of curiosity. Service has improved noticeably since a year ago. The view on a good day is impressive and I would certainly recommend all first timers to Shanghai stay here. Breakfast and room service are both of excellent quality. Downsides - getting very expensive now at around US$250 or so per night in peak season (like now). This is in a country where GDP per capita is only US$1,000 p.a.! But it's very crowded with loads of tourists and business people. The atrium style internal design means that public areas can get noisy. And because of the crowds room preference is sometimes unavailable unless you have super frequent stayer status. Rooms can also be strange as the design means there are many shapes. Astonishingly enough there are no HBO or Cinemax programmes in the rooms. All in all, still a good hotel but value for money is average only. I prefer the St Regis as it is quieter, less expensive and has bigger rooms.	
May 25 2009 	nice hotel in a good location	I have visited Shanghai many times before and this was my stay here. The hotel is an an excellent location. There are two sub-way lines close by - Hengshan Road and another one. There is a huge tree-line park opposite the hotel and and close by is the Xujajai (sic) shopping area. There was a McDonalds and KFC there. In addition Hengshan road has a huge number of bars. There are good dining choices on this road. We had a Brazilian night buffet for some 95 RMB. The in-hotel dining is OK, but by Chinese standards I have been less expensive hotels with far more elaborate choices. The breakfast buffet is a good choice of western and chinese and some Japanese fair. Service in the hotel was excellent but horrendous in the buffet. It is overstaffed and the waiters would go about doing their work mechanically and never made eye contact with customers. You could be waiting endlessly for a coffee refill and no one would notice. I think the hotel definitely needs to work on the training aspect. Waiters and all staff at the hotel were very polite. The internet connection was excellent. Good wi-fi downstairs and wired connection upstairs. They had a tiny business area where they did not have a color printer (weird). A common theme I noticed in China was that carpets are poorly kept. I am yet to see a hotel with clean and spotless carpets. That said I would definitely stay there again.	
Dec 15 2008 	nice hotel	I stayed two weeks at this hotel, and it is in the good location, subway just 5 mins walk and big shopping centers are 10-15 mins walk. The hotel room is really clean and in good condition. Good rain shower in the bath room. The services are really good, people are very polite there.I stayed in the executive level, which having free afternoon tea and internet access. this hotel seems like business travel hotel, but still very nice for the holiday travellers.I will definately come back to this hotel.	
Apr 6 2008 	Good but let down by location and layout	Stayed here for 3 nights after a work conference at the Shangri-La. A number of other people have already said they had trouble getting their taxi driver to find the Hyatt, as it's so new - I had the same problem getting to the hotel from Pudong, and several other times during my stay. It feels a little like the Hyatt has landed from outer space in a rather dusty and quiet area. It's actually on the same road (about 3 minutes away) from the Astor Hotel, which has been around for years - would recommend perhaps mentioning that to taxi drivers if they don't know where they're going? Inside the hotel, it's all quite good on first impressions - the lobby is massive - feels a bit like an airport terminal building with chillout music playing in the background. Had a standard room in the East wing. It all feels a bit Japanese inside - warm woods and minimalist. The layout of the standard rooms is a bit of a problem, though - the bathroom area is actually open plan, with silding partitions to divide it off for privacy. A bit weird, but alright. But there's no proper wardrobe - just a hanging area in the bathroom, with some drawers, which is a bit awkward to get access to, and overly fiddly and annoying. Had breakfast in the Aroma restaurant - good selection as you'd expect, but the staff were overly keen to clear things away before we'd finished them. Gym and pool in the basement are amazing - vitually empty every time I went, which was even better. Not a very good free weight selection, though. The bar on the top floor (Vue) is alright - good views of both Pudong and the Bund because of where the hotel is located. If you want to look at the pretty view, remember that the lights in both Pudong and the Bund are turned off fairly early in the evening. Not much of a buzz though, compared to say the Jade36 bar in the Pudong Shangri-La - suspect because this place is a little out of the way. Concierge was helpful - they got us a great table at the Jean-Georges restaurant on the Bund - would recommend the tasting menu if you go there (RMB900). But the concierge also recommended a complete dump of a place when we said we wanted to go and buy some jewellery - they sent us to this tourist trap in Jingan - avoid like the plague if they recommend to you too. Overall, a good hotel, but the location isn't great. It's not too far from the Bund - maybe about 10-15 minutes, but the walk there is a little dusty and ropey. Plus, the layout of the standard rooms is very annoying. Probably wouldn't stay here again. Jumeirah is opening a new hotel near Xin Tian Di later this year - plan to try it out next time.	
	Wonderful Hotel	We stayed at Le Meridien during our Shanghai part of our China trip. I had a cold and was feeling a little miserable when we arrived. But as soon as I entered the room, I had forgotten my cold! Our room was on the 36th(?) floor and the view was wonderful. Although the room was not large, it felt spacious. The furnishing was modern contemporary. My husband liked the rain shower. The location of the hotel was ideal for sightseeing. The only thing was internet was not included, and we thought we could do without. (We had internet with our previous China hotels and we thought we did not use it that much. But we missed it here when we had no access.)We are thinking about returning China in a year or two, with our children. We would love to stay at Le Meridien again.	
Apr 19 2007 	Great Place	Hotel was in excellent location about 1 km to The Bund, Old China andNinjing Road. We had booked a 3 bedroom &quot;superior&quot; suite but on arrival that was not available for some reason and they put us ina 2 bedroom and a 1 bedroom suite which was fine. The 2 BR was a smoking room but they could not or would not change it claiming the hotel wasfull. Did offer to try to change the following day though after I pushed the issue. Over all the staff were cordial and generally friendly and spoke good english but I wouldn't say they went overboard in the service e.g. didn't seem to know how to smile. The rooms were fine (once we got rid of the smoking) and clean. Great views (we were on the 23rd floor). We did have suites so not sure what the &quot;normal rooms&quot; were like. The beds were rock hard which was the only bad mark I could give. TV was ok with mix of English (CNN, HBO, ESPN) and Chinese channels. Business centre on 2nd floor so you could easily catch up on news from home via internet.Restuarant provided a good western style breakfast but would not recomend for evening meal. Plenty of Chinese restuarants nearby as alternative. Also a small supermarket across the road so you could get your own supplies. All up, enjoyed my stay at the hotel and wouldgo back again. There were 4 of us, myself, wife and 2 late teenage children and we were comfortable.	
Jun 22 2007 	Two rooms - one hotel	The first room I received was on the 3rd floor which is non-smoking. It was a very large corner suite. The windows are single pane and it sounded like the traffic outside was coming through my room. The bed was the worst of the three hotels in China I stayed at. I spoke to the front desk eand was moved to the 12th floor. The upper floors are business rooms and my room had a computer. The room had been remodeled and I could barely hear the traffic noise. Once I changed rooms I really began to enjoy my stay. The breakfast buffet was ok, but no ther amenities - this is an old hotel. Lots of foreign tourists were there.	
Dec 16 2006 	Perfect four days at the Shangri La	We had high expectations for the hotel as we had stayed in the Bangkok Shangri La several years ago and thought it was fantastic. We were not disappointed as every aspect of the hotel from the service to the cleanliness was faultless. We had booked a bund view premier room in Tower 2 which was superbly appointed. The premier rooms are seemingly the largest in Shanghai and worth the money. We visited several other hotels during our stay including the Hyatt and much preferred the Shangri La. As we were on holiday we took advantage of treatments in the Chi Spa and used the leisure facilities which were great.	
Jul 20 2009 	Good Value Hotel Central Location	Nice hotel, excellent location in the Center of Shanghai. Rooms are well appointed with everything needed, WiFi is included. Metro is easy to use, or taxis. Xintiandi is a good area with lots of restaurants nearby although a little pricey.	
Nov 17 2009 	Great facilities and rooms	I've stayed here multiple times and again in Nov. 2009. The rooms are very functional, clean, and just right. The plugs, internet, desk, phone etc. are all very nice. The location near Century park is good or bad depending on what you want to do. Others have complained about not much around, which is true for the immediate area, but if you go one direction for about 1 km, you get to the MTR station and that will get you to all the hustle and bustle in less than 30 minutes. In the other direction, for about 1 km, you will get a nice group of restaurants (some western), Carrefour, Starbucks etc. Both are relatively easy walking distance. I usually walk down to the Starbucks for an expensive cup of coffee and get some pastry near by. If you want to be somewhat more adventurous, you can walk to the next block in the morning and get a traditional Chinese breakfast for a song (a meat bun is 1.2 yuan - less than 20 cents USD). There is also a Family Mart right across the street where you can get water and other quick stuff. Since my business in further east than the hotel, this is a good place for me. The rates are really good for Shanghai. During this trip, I also stayed at the Crowne Plaza right next door and the Renaissance is much, much better.	
Apr 24 2009 	If only the toilet flushed...	This hotel would get rave reviews from me and my husband if it wasnt for the toilet situation. Let me preempt that by saying that a working toilet is essential to us when we stay in a hotel - if that wasnt important, we would have just gone to a campsite.They put us in this &quot;matrimonial room&quot; and the toilet didnt flush. We stayed a total of 4 nights in the hotel and after the 2nd night, we asked to change rooms and they were able to give us a new room, which was great. The toilet in this room flushed slowly but it did its job but it did stop working on our last day there. But we were already leaving so we didnt bother complaining about it. They have issues with their plumbing for sure. This was in November 2008 so they might have fixed it by now.There were a lot of good things about this hotel. Breakfast was nice and hearty; we were a hop and a skip away from a subway stop and surrounded by little restaurants and mall and fast food places. The staff were pretty accomodating and friendly, and our hotel rate was pretty cheap - around 50 USD a night. So like I said, this would be a stellar hotel if it wasnt for the toilet.	
Dec 27 2007 	Superb blend of east and west	I spent 6 nights here on business. I was on the Starwood Preferred Guests Floor which was 19th out of 26. I can't speak for other floors, but my room was spacious, comfortable and thoroughly immaculate. Bathroom was completely new and modern. Seating and desk area was comfortable. The hotel in general is opulent and well staffed. It has wonderful Chinese styling so you don't feel like you are at home, but don't feel out of place either. There are attendants everywhere ready to help. It is a major ex pat hotel so English is pervasive. No language difficulties. They cater to English speakers and greatly helped directing taxi drivers and making reservations. I thought the room was reasonably priced, but everything else is way overpriced by local standards. Breakfast is near $30! Mini-bar items were twice what I'd expect even in NYC. This is surprising considering there were numerous local and more reasonable options available nearby. The PROS - right off of the highway makes it easy access for taxis. It is near a number of high-end department stores and numerous restaurants (including Starbucks for morning coffee and McD when you just need a french-fry fix.). Area is Westernized so you'll feel plenty comfortable exploring.The CONS - it is outside central loop, a good 20+ minutes to the Bund, and longer to Pudong. Area is Westernized so it lacks a local flavor. Not much by way of cheap local shops, most stores are higher priced (but not necessarily higher quality). It's a 15min walk to the nearest subway station so taxis are required, but they're cheap!	
Sep 27 2009 	Phenomenal Hotel	This place was our final stay during our tour package. Pretty amazing hotel, I must say. It easily rivaled some of the best hotels I've ever stayed in in the US. Beautiful rooms, very luxurious, amazing lobby. The breakfast was very good, not outstanding, but it was very good. I was expecting more since the hotel itself is so awesome, but I have no complaints about the breakfast. The chef of the breakfast is a European guy, so the Euro stuff is good, but the Asian stuff is not so good. Otherwise, it was a great hotel, no question.	
May 13 2008 	Good business hotel	stayed here for a weekend - good business hotel in decent location close to the Bund - check in was fine - nearly all staff had passable English - room was nice, good size and very clean with big walk in shower and stand alone tub - food was ok - had the lunch buffet and then breakfast to the room - both ok for western food in a chinese city - made the most of the hotel car; taxi's are a complete nightmare so its worth every cent to have the hotel car instead of getting lost,ripped off, robbed etc - overall good standard hotel for good standard rate	
Nov 15 2009 	Great accomodation let down by a terrible restaurant	We loved our room at URBN, the design and style was amazing and the hotel staff were attentive. The location is great. The restaurant was disappointing though, and really detracted from our experience. The food was oily and uncreative, one dish was so oily i physically felt ill and didn't finish it. The manager of the restaurant was also quite rude, which really was a shame given how much we enjoyed the other aspects of the hotel. I would stay there again...but will be going out to eat!
